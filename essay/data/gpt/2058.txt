The Mediterranean islands are well-known for their unique biodiversity and endemic species. Unfortunately, due to various human activities over the past millennia, many of these islands' fauna have seen dramatic declines, with some species going extinct. The causes of these extinctions and their prevalence have been the focus of a significant amount of research and debate in recent years. This essay will examine the evidence for and against human-induced faunal extinctions on two of the largest Mediterranean islands, Mallorca and Cyprus, and will consider the implications of these findings.
Mallorca is the largest of the Balearic Islands, situated off the eastern coast of Spain. Its fauna includes several endemic species, including the Mallorcan midwife toad, the Balearic shearwater, and the Moustached warbler. The island has been inhabited by humans for at least 5000 years, with significant evidence of human activity dating back to the Talayotic period, around 2500 BCE. Over the centuries, the island has been inhabited by various cultures, including the Phoenicians, the Carthaginians, the Romans, and the Moors. All of these groups are known to have hunted or exploited the island's wildlife to some extent.
The current consensus among researchers is that human activity has had a significant impact on the fauna of Mallorca, with several species having gone extinct in the recent past. The most famous of these is the Mallorcan giant tortoise, which was driven to extinction by the end of the 15th century, likely due to hunting for meat and the destruction of its habitat. Other extinct species include the Mallorcan cave horse, the brown bear, and the lynx.
There is also evidence to suggest that some extant species have suffered significant population declines due to human activity. The Balearic shearwater, for example, is listed as endangered by the IUCN, with population declines attributed to hunting, disturbance by feral cats, and the use of longline fishing methods. The Moustached warbler is also considered to be vulnerable, with its habitat loss and degradation attributed to human activities such as land development and agriculture. 
However, some researchers have argued that the impact of humans on the fauna of Mallorca may have been overstated. For example, a recent study by Pérez-Obiol et al. (2020) found no evidence of significant faunal turnover during the Talayotic period, suggesting that the island's fauna may have been relatively stable until the Roman era. This study has been criticized by some researchers, who have pointed out that it only looked at one site on the island, and that other evidence suggests that humans had a significant impact on the island's fauna during this period.
Cyprus is another large Mediterranean island that has been subjected to human activity for thousands of years. The island's fauna includes several endemic species, including the Cyprus mouflon, the Cyprus warbler, and the Cyprus grass snake. Humans have been present on the island since at least the Neolithic period, with various cultures – including the Greeks, the Romans, and the Ottomans – having inhabited the island over the millennia.
Like Mallorca, Cyprus has seen significant faunal extinctions over the centuries. The most famous of these is the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus, which went extinct around 4000 years ago, likely due to hunting and habitat destruction by humans. Other extinct species include the Cyprus dwarf elephant, the Cyprus scops owl, and the Cyprus aurochs.
There is also evidence to suggest that extant species on Cyprus have been impacted by human activities. The Cyprus mouflon, for example, has been hunted extensively in the past, leading to a significant population decline. The species was reintroduced to the island in the 20th century, and its population has since recovered somewhat, although it is still considered to be vulnerable. The Cyprus grass snake is also under threat due to habitat degradation and loss caused by human activities such as development and agriculture.
As with Mallorca, there is some debate among researchers about the extent of human impact on the fauna of Cyprus. A recent study by Alcover et al. (2021) suggested that many of the island's endemic species may have survived longer than previously thought, with some extinctions occurring as recently as the medieval period. This study has been criticized by some researchers, who have pointed out that it relied on a limited dataset and did not take into account some of the other known impacts of human activity on the island's fauna.
Overall, the evidence suggests that human activities have had a significant impact on the fauna of both Mallorca and Cyprus, with numerous extinctions having occurred over the millennia. The exact causes of these extinctions are debated, with hunting, habitat destruction, and climate change all likely to have played a role. It is also clear that many extant species on these islands are under threat due to continued human activity, such as land development, agriculture, and hunting. 
While much of the damage done to the fauna of these islands is irreversible, efforts are being made to protect and restore what remains. Several species, such as the Cyprus mouflon, have been reintroduced or protected, and conservation efforts are ongoing for many others. However, these efforts are often hampered by ongoing human activities and the continued impacts of climate change, which threatens to exacerbate many of the existing threats to island biodiversity.
In conclusion, the evidence for human-induced faunal extinctions on the Mediterranean islands of Mallorca and Cyprus is strong. While there is some debate about the extent of human impact and the exact causes of extinctions, it is clear that humans have played a significant role in shaping the fauna of these islands over the past millennia. The implications of these findings are significant, as they highlight the need for ongoing conservation efforts and the importance of limiting the impacts of human activity on island ecosystems.
