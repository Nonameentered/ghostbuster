Edvard Beneš was a leading politician in Czechoslovakia and served as the second President of Czechoslovakia from 1935 to 1938 and again from 1945 to 1948. His tenure as the president witnessed a catastrophic period for Czech people when Nazi armies conquered Czechoslovakia during World War II. During the occupation, Edvard Beneš played a crucial role in addressing the needs of the Czech people and coming up with strategies to protect them from Nazi oppression. This essay will analyze how Edvard Beneš interpreted and addressed the needs of the Czech people during the Nazi occupation and to what extent his strategies and actions can be considered successful.
Beneš was a staunch believer in the Czechoslovakian independence and fought relentlessly against those that threatened it. He was also a strong advocate for democracy and liberty, which he believed were vital for the development of Czechoslovakia. However, Beneš was aware of the imminent danger that the Nazi army posed to Czechoslovakia, and he knew that it was essential to strategize carefully to protect the interests and welfare of his people. Beneš took a pragmatic approach that emphasized negotiation, cooperation, and tactical diplomacy to deal with the Nazi occupation.
Beneš began his anti-Nazi campaign even before the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. After his resignation from the presidency in October 1938, Beneš went into exile in London, where he formed the Czechoslovak National Council, which became a formal government-in-exile. Beneš’s government-in-exile became the voice of the Czech people, and he worked tirelessly to ensure their welfare. He established strong relationships with the British government, and he used these relationships to lobby support for Czechoslovakia. However, it wasn't until after Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in 1940 that the Czechoslovak government-in-exile was recognized by the allies.
Beneš and his government-in-exile played a crucial role in ensuring that the wartime economy of Czechoslovakia was adequately managed to meet the needs of the Czech people. Beneš established an intelligence network to gather information about the German occupation of Czechoslovakia and shared the information with the allies. He also ensured that Czechoslovakia’s wartime economy was well-managed and did not fall under Nazi control. This move was critical to ensure that the Czech people had access to the necessities amidst the Nazi occupation.
Beneš' most significant contribution to the welfare of Czechoslovakia’s citizens during the Nazi occupation came in his efforts to protect Czechoslovakia's Jews. Beneš was a firm believer in the equality of all Czechoslovakians, irrespective of their ethnicity, religion, or social status. He strongly opposed the Nazi treatment of Jews, and he was passionate about ensuring their safety and welfare during the occupation. To this end, he founded the Czechoslovak Society of International Law and appointed František Pernička, an esteemed lawyer, to lead the group.
The Czechoslovak Society of International Law saw the creation of the Czechoslovak Government in London working in concert with the International Red Cross. They submitted a report to the United Nations Assembly highlighting the human rights violations against Czech Jews. The report became the basis for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948. Part of Beneš’s strategy to protect Czechoslovakia's Jews was to establish underground networks to smuggle Jews out of the country. These networks transported over 5,000 Jews to safety during the occupation, saving countless lives. This action could be considered one of the most successful actions of Beneš during his tenure, as it showed great concern for the welfare of the people he represented regardless of their background. 
One of Beneš's closely monitored initiatives was the mobilization of the Czechoslovakian army in the Great Britain Diaspora. It began in August 1940 when Czechoslovakian soldiers fled German-occupied Czechoslovakia. Roughly 20,000 people joined the Czechoslovakian forces in Great Britain. They were employed across the British Commonwealth, the Middle East and Africa, participating in battle stations worldwide. Beneš meticulously planned this mobilization, which effectively served as a strategy to employ Czechoslovakia’s military power against the Nazi army. This allowed Czechoslovakia's army to contribute to allied victories while protecting its own interests.
Despite the efforts of Beneš and other Czechoslovakian officials in London, the Nazi occupation remained violent and dehumanizing. The Nazi regime sought to erase any aspect of Czech culture and identity that threatened the Germanic supremacy. The Czech people were exposed to violence and humiliation, and their very existence was at risk of being erased. Beneš and his government-in-exile did all they could to protect the people of Czechoslovakia during the occupation. However, their efforts were limited by the power of Nazi Germany. 
In conclusion, Edvard Beneš played a crucial role in protecting the welfare of Czech people during the Nazi occupation. His strategies involved mobilizing the country's diplomatic, military, and underground power against Nazi power, ensuring that the Czech people remained safe, to the best of his ability. Beneš was a passionate advocate for Czechoslovakian democracy and independence and saw the need for strong alliances for the Czechoslovakian government to resist Nazi advance. As history would show, the Nazi oppression continued to be too oppressive to fend entirely. Nevertheless, how Beneš tackled the situation showed foresight and great concern for the Czechoslovakian people's welfare during a tumultuous period. His legacy would inspire future leaders to protect their people's interests and wellbeing, regardless of any monumental external force- internalizing Beneš' belief that the welfare of a country's people is a leader's first priority.
