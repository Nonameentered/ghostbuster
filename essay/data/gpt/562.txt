The development and evolution of the English common law system have played a significant role in shaping the contemporary legal systems of modern liberal democracies across the glove. While Judeo-Christian theology created a strong moral foundation, the secular legal profession in England had a significant role to play in shaping the modern-day legal system. The core principles of English common law and the secular legal profession are influenced by multiple factors, including the powerful philosophical, religious, legal, political, and social influences of medieval and early modern commentators. In this essay, we will discuss the role of Judeo-Christian theology in shaping the development of English common law and the secular legal profession, the influence of influential medieval and early modern commentators on English common law, the role of encroaching Roman civil law, and how Judeo-Christian teachings helped to legitimize and strengthen common law.
The development of the English common law system was characterized by a diverse range of influences, including Roman, Germanic, and Celtic law. However, the influence of Judeo-Christian theology on English common law is undeniable. From the time of the Anglo-Saxon period, Judeo-Christian traditions have played a significant role in English law-making. The biblical foundations of the Judeo-Christian tradition offer a strong moral foundation, which has guided the English legal system over time. In his book "The Christian Foundations of the Common Law," Patrick M. Brennan argues that Christian teachings provided the foundation for the English legal system. The Old Testament's principles of justice and righteousness, which were affirmed throughout the New Testament, became the core principles of English common law.
One of the earliest and most significant influences of Judeo-Christian theology on English common law came from the Christianization of Europe. In the 6th century, the Christian church established the first schools to educate the clergy and the courts' judges. These schools became the breeding ground for scholars who were trained in the Christian tradition, and many of these scholars later became influential in shaping English common law. The introduction of Christianity had a considerable impact on the English legal system, and Christianity's influence on the English common law continues to this day.
Another significant influence on English common law came from the works of Sir John Fortescue. Fortescue was a renowned jurist and legal scholar who lived during the 15th century. In his book 'De Laudibus Legum Angli,â€™ Fortescue argues that the English common law system is superior to the Roman civil law system. Fortescue believed that the unique characteristics of English common law made it a more equitable and just system than the Roman civil law system. Fortescue also believed that the English legal system was based on the principles of natural law and divine law, which were prevalent in the Judeo-Christian theology.
However, it is important to note that while Fortescue made a significant contribution to English common law, his views were not the only influence on the legal system. Other scholars and jurists also made significant contributions to the development of English common law, including William Dugdale and Sir Edward Coke. Dugdale, a 17th-century English antiquary, wrote extensively on legal history. His works provided valuable historical insight into the development of English common law. Sir Edward Coke, on the other hand, was a lawyer and politician who lived in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Coke was known for his legal mind and was an important figure in the development of English common law. He is best known for his work, "The Institutes of the Lawes of England," which became a cornerstone of the English common law system.
The role of the Roman civil law system must also be considered in the context of English common law's development. Roman civil law was gaining influence and dominance in Europe during the Middle Ages. Some scholars argue that the Roman civil law system was a significant threat to the English common law system. However, many English jurists and scholars believed that the Judeo-Christian notions of justice and equity, which formed the basis of English common law, were far superior to the Roman civil law system's abstract principles.
In conclusion, while it is evident that judaeo-Christian theology was a significant influence on the development of English common law and the secular legal profession, it was not the sole influence. The views of influential commentators such as Sir John Fortescue, William Dugdale, and Sir Edward Coke, and the influence of the Roman civil law also played crucial roles in the development of English common law. The application of Judeo-Christian teachings in the English common law system helped to legitimize and strengthen it, ensuring that principles of morality and justice remained a core tenet of the legal system. The modern legal system owes a great deal of gratitude to these influences, which shaped the development of a legal system that is considered one of the fairest and most just in the world.
