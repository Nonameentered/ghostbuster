In his article, "Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong," J.L. Mackie presents an argument for second order moral scepticism. He argues that moral values and duties are not objective, but rather are human inventions that exist only because of our subjective need for them. In his argument, Mackie relies on two main ideas - the arguments from relativity and queerness - to refute the claim to objectivity. This essay will examine Mackie's argument for second order moral scepticism and assess whether it holds up under scrutiny.
Mackie defines second order moral scepticism as the belief that moral values and duties do not exist as part of the natural world, but are instead created by human beings. According to Mackie, first-order moral claims are assertions about what is right or wrong, good or bad, just or unjust. Second-order moral claims, on the other hand, are assertions about the status or nature of moral claims themselves. Mackie's second-order claim is that all first-order moral claims are false because they presuppose the existence of objective moral values and duties, which do not actually exist.
Mackie argues that moral values and duties are not objective, but rather are human inventions. He claims that moral values and duties "must be invented or created" because they are not part of the natural order of things (Mackie, p. 40). In other words, morality is a product of human culture and society, rather than a fundamental feature of the universe. Mackie supports this claim by pointing out that moral codes differ from society to society and from time to time. He argues that if moral values and duties were objective, they would be universal and unchanging. The fact that they are not suggests that they are the products of human invention rather than objective facts about the world.
Mackie's argument from relativity is based on the observation that different societies have different moral codes. He argues that if moral values and duties were objective, they would be the same in all societies and at all times. The fact that they are not suggests that they are relative to the society in which they are held. Mackie acknowledges that there may be some basic moral principles that are shared by all societies, such as the prohibition against killing or stealing. However, he argues that these principles are too vague to provide a basis for objective moral values and duties.
Mackie's argument from queerness is based on the observation that moral values and duties are different from anything else in the natural world. He argues that objective moral values and duties would have to be something that exists independently of human beings and that is discovered rather than invented. Mackie claims that there is no evidence for the existence of such a thing, and that the concept of objective moral values and duties is "deeply queer" (Mackie, p. 37). According to Mackie, the only way to explain the existence of moral values and duties is to acknowledge that they are human inventions.
Mackie's argument for second order moral scepticism is compelling, but it is not without its critics. One objection to Mackie's argument is that it conflates the idea of objective morality with the idea of universal morality. Some philosophers argue that moral values and duties may be objective in the sense that they are based on objective facts about human nature or the nature of the universe, but that they may still be relative to particular societies or times. This view maintains that there can be objective moral values and duties that are relative to particular circumstances.
Another objection to Mackie's argument is that it relies on a narrow conception of objectivity. Some philosophers argue that objectivity does not require the existence of a transcendent moral realm, but rather can be based on the shared beliefs and practices of a particular community. According to this view, moral values and duties can be objective in the sense that they are shared by members of a particular community, even if they are not universal or absolute.
Despite these objections, Mackie's argument for second order moral scepticism remains a powerful and influential critique of the claim to moral objectivity. His arguments from relativity and queerness challenge the idea that moral values and duties are objective, and suggest that they are the products of human invention. While there may be valid objections to Mackie's argument, it remains an important contribution to the ongoing debate about the nature and status of morality.
