Michel de Montaigne’s preface to his collection of essays, titled “To the Reader,” sets a unique tone and style that distinguishes his writing from the works of other philosophers and essayists of his time. In this essay, I will explore how Montaigne’s preface establishes a sense of honesty and modesty towards the author himself, and how this tone is further reinforced in his section “On presuming.”
Montaigne begins his preface by outlining his approach to the art of writing, stating that he wishes to present himself “in his natural and simple way, without straining himself or coveting, the word of others.” This statement immediately sets the tone for the rest of Montaigne’s collection; he does not wish to present himself as a scholar or authority on any particular topic, but instead desires to convey his own personal experiences and reflections in a sincere and frank manner. His use of the first-person perspective throughout his work serves to reinforce this idea of honesty and authenticity, as he is not attempting to present an objective view of the world, but rather how he perceives and interprets it.
Montaigne’s preface is also notable for its sense of modesty towards the author himself. He admits that he is not an expert in any particular field of study, stating that he is “content with having made myself a little better…than I was.” This admission reveals Montaigne’s humility and lack of pretension, as he is not attempting to present himself as an authority on any particular subject, but rather as a person with his own thoughts and experiences to share.
This sense of modesty towards the author is reinforced throughout Montaigne’s section “On Presumption,” which serves as an examination of the dangers of arrogance and conceit. Montaigne acknowledges that everyone is subject to the temptation of presuming too much about oneself, stating that “we are born to be foolhardy and impudent.” However, he also warns that those who become addicted to the “fumes of the impression of their own worth” will inevitably be “cast into the gulf of presumption.”
Montaigne’s view on presuming is rooted in his understanding of humanity as fundamentally flawed and imperfect. He understands that every person is prone to making mistakes and holding flawed beliefs, and therefore, it is important to remain humble and open to criticism. He states that “it is well to learn, and it is well to correct oneself,” which displays his belief in the importance of self-improvement and the willingness to admit one’s faults.
Montaigne’s writing style throughout his essays is characterized by a directness and simplicity that differs from the ornate and elaborate prose of other writers of his time. He uses short, concise sentences that are easy to understand, and his use of anecdotes and personal stories serves to make his points more relatable. Montaigne’s writing style is reflective of his desire to present himself “in his natural and simple way,” without any artificial pretensions or grandiose claims.
This sense of simplicity and directness is exemplified in Montaigne’s essay “On Miracles,” in which he examines the question of whether miracles are possible. Rather than relying on complex philosophical arguments or theological treatises, Montaigne presents a series of personal stories and observations to support his position. He recounts the story of a woman who claimed to have given birth to a snake, arguing that such reports are often based on superstition and ignorance. Montaigne’s approach is notable for its reliance on personal experience and observation, rather than abstract logic or dogmatic belief.
Montaigne’s writing style and tone are heavily influenced by his views on human nature and the importance of honesty and modesty. His approach to writing is to present himself as he truly is, without any artificial pretensions or attempts to impress the reader. His belief in the importance of self-improvement and openness to criticism is evident throughout his essays, as he constantly challenges his own assumptions and beliefs.
Montaigne’s approach to writing has had a significant impact on the field of philosophy and essay writing, influencing later writers such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Friedrich Nietzsche. His focus on personal experience, honesty, and self-awareness has become a guiding principle for many writers and thinkers, who seek to present their own unique perspectives on the world in a sincere and authentic manner.
In conclusion, Montaigne’s preface “To the Reader” sets the stage for his unique writing style, which emphasizes honesty and modesty towards oneself. His section “On presumption” serves as a warning of the dangers of arrogance and the importance of humility and self-improvement. Montaigne’s writing style is characterized by its simplicity and directness, as he uses personal stories and observations to illustrate his points. His approach to writing has had a lasting influence on the field of philosophy and essay writing, as his focus on personal experience, honesty, and self-awareness has become a guiding principle for many writers and thinkers.
