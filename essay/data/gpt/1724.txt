Structural engineers often have to design beams that are subject to torsional loads. In these situations, accurate predictions of the beam's performance are crucial to ensure the safety and stability of the entire structure. This report investigates three different methods for estimating the performance of an I section beam under pure torsional loads. The methods were compared, and the report discussed the factors that need to be taken into account when designing structures that may subject non-circular sections to torsional loads. 
The three methods for estimating the performance of an I section beam under pure torsional loads are: 
1. The approximate method: This method is the simplest and easiest to use. It involves assuming that the shear flow is linear and that the twist angle is proportional to the applied torque. This method does not take into account the variation of the shear flow along the length of the beam. 
2. The semi-empirical method: This method takes into account the variation of the shear flow along the length of the beam. It uses empirical formulas to estimate the shear flow and twist angle at different locations along the beam. 
3. The exact method: This method is the most accurate but also the most complex. It involves solving the differential equations that govern the behavior of the beam under torsional loads. This method provides a detailed analysis of the beam's behavior but requires extensive calculations.
To compare the three methods, the report used a finite element analysis to simulate the behavior of an I section beam under pure torsional loads. The results showed that the approximate method gave the poorest predictions, while the semi-empirical method and the exact method gave similar and more accurate results. 
The factors that need to be taken into account when designing structures that may subject non-circular sections to torsional loads include:
1. Beam shape: Non-circular sections have varying shapes and sizes. The more complex the shape, the more difficult it is to predict the beam's performance accurately. 
2. Material: The material properties of the beam, such as its strength, stiffness, and ductility, affect its performance under torsional loads. 
3. Loading conditions: The magnitude and distribution of the applied loads affect the beam's behavior and the resulting torsional stresses. 
4. Support conditions: The way the beam is supported affects its behavior and the resulting torsional stresses. 
These factors affect the accuracy of theoretical calculations in several ways. First, the complexity of the beam's shape makes the calculations more difficult and prone to error. Second, the material properties and loading conditions affect the accuracy of the assumptions made in the calculations. For example, if the material properties of the beam are not accurately known, the calculations will be less accurate. Finally, the support conditions can significantly affect the beam's behavior under torsional loads. If the support conditions are not accurately modeled, the calculations will be less accurate. 
In conclusion, the correct estimation of the performance of a beam under torsional loads is crucial for the design of safe and stable structures. The three methods investigated in this report for estimating the performance of an I section beam subjected to pure torsional loads were the approximate method, the semi-empirical method, and the exact method. The results showed that the approximate method gave the poorest predictions, and the semi-empirical method and the exact method gave similar and more accurate results. The factors that need to be taken into account when designing structures that may subject non-circular sections to torsional loads include beam shape, material, loading conditions, and support conditions. These factors affect the accuracy of theoretical calculations, and engineers must take them into account when designing structures.
