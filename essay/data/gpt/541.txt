The concept of corporate social responsibility (CSR) is widely debated amongst those involved in business and management. The idea that companies should have a responsibility towards wider society and not just their shareholders has gained momentum in recent years, leading to discussions around which model – the stakeholder or shareholder model – is the better approach. In this essay, I will argue that the stakeholder model is a better approach to addressing social responsibility compared to the shareholder model, using the case study of Nestle to evaluate the effectiveness of different corporate governance and CSR practices. 
The shareholder model is based on the premise that businesses exist to maximize shareholder value through profit-making activities. As a result, decision-making within companies is primarily focused on the interests of shareholders, with less consideration given to the needs and opinions of other stakeholders, such as employees, customers, and communities. In contrast, the stakeholder model is centered around the idea that companies have a social obligation to all stakeholders affected by their actions, and not just shareholders. This approach involves taking responsibility for the social and environmental impacts of business activities and making decisions that balance the interests of different stakeholders to create long-term value for the company and wider society.
One company that provides an insightful case study for evaluating the effectiveness of the stakeholder and shareholder models is Nestle. Nestle is a multinational food and beverage company with operations in 191 countries worldwide. The company has faced several CSR-related controversies over the years, leading to intense public scrutiny and criticism. However, Nestle's response to these controversies provides a valuable insight into the effectiveness of different approaches to corporate governance and CSR.
One of the most notable cases of CSR-related controversy involving Nestle was the company's promotion and marketing of baby formula in developing countries. The promotion of formula and the subsequent decline in breastfeeding rates put many infants at risk of malnutrition and disease. The controversy led to a global campaign by NGOs, the boycott of Nestle products, and accusations of aggressive marketing. Nestle's initial response to the crisis was ineffective, heavily defensive, and seen as focused on shareholder value rather than the welfare of other stakeholders.
However, Nestle's response to the issue slowly evolved, with the company eventually adopting a more comprehensive approach that addressed the needs of different stakeholders. The company developed and implemented a program to promote breastfeeding education and support in developing countries. This initiative was seen as moving the company towards a more stakeholder-oriented approach. Nestle also emerged as one of the first multinationals to publish a comprehensive CSR report that covered aspects such as ethical sourcing, climate change, and human rights.
Nestle's change in attitude and approach to CSR reflects the wider shift towards the stakeholder model, which is now seen as the best way for companies to address social responsibility. The stakeholder model recognizes that companies must balance the needs of all stakeholders to create long-term value, as opposed to the shareholder model, which primarily focuses on maximizing shareholder value. Companies that adopt a stakeholder-oriented approach, such as Nestle, are more likely to build trust, establish robust relationships, and enhance their reputation with different stakeholders.
Furthermore, the stakeholder model aligns with the shift in consumer values and expectations. Today's consumers are increasingly conscious of their role in society and are more inclined to support companies that are transparent, ethical, and socially responsible. Nestle's CSR initiatives aligned with these developments and were seen as enhancing its reputation and improving the perception of the company. As such, the stakeholder model is deemed more effective than the shareholder model in addressing social responsibility, as it reflects the changing expectations of society and creates the foundations for long-term sustainable success.
In conclusion, Nestle's case study provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of the stakeholder and shareholder models in addressing social responsibility. While companies such as Nestle may initially adopt a shareholder-focused approach, the negative experience of controversies can lead to a change in attitudes and practices towards the stakeholder model. Companies adopting stakeholder-oriented approaches, such as Nestle, are better positioned to build and expand their reputation, develop relationships, and create long-term value. The stakeholder model provides a framework that helps companies address social responsibility appropriately, and therefore, it is a more effective approach compared to the shareholder model.
