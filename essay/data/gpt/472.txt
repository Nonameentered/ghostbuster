Democracy is the foundation of America's political system. The nation has been a symbol of democracy. The country has been promoting democratic values and principles around the world. However, over the years, the democratic process in America has been losing its hold. One of the significant indicators of this decline is the low voter turnout. Even though voting is considered a fundamental right, America's voter turnout has been consistently lower than other democratic nations across the world. Millions of eligible voters did not participate in the 2020 presidential election, and this is not an isolated case. It has become a recurring phenomenon over the years. This essay explores the factors causing declining voter participation in America.
One of the factors contributing to the declining voter participation in America is the complex and outdated electoral system. Voting is different across states, making it confusing and challenging for citizens to understand the process. The problem is further compounded by the registration process that is time-consuming and complicated, especially for individuals with less access to resources or technology. The United States also holds federal, state, and local elections simultaneously, which can be overwhelming for voters. The mix of elections often makes it difficult for voters to understand precisely what they are voting for, resulting in voter disinterest and low turnouts. Moreover, the elections held outside of the presidential year tend to receive much lower voter turnout, indicating that the country's electoral system needs to be overhauled.
Another reason for declining voter participation in America is the politicization of voting. The democratic process should be a unifying force, bringing people with divergent views together. However, this is not the case in America, where individuals are continually partisan and divided along party lines. The political atmosphere is often so divisive that many Americans feel discouraged from engaging in political activities. Politicization of the electoral process also brings mistrust in the voting system, which can impact voter participation. The recent controversies surrounding the 2020 presidential election further fuelled mistrust among voters regarding the legitimacy of the election, which could make it difficult to reverse the decline in voter turnout.
Moreover, voter suppression is also a significant contributor to the decline in voter participation in America. The discriminatory tactics used to suppress voter participation in America are uninspiring, and it is surprising that they still exist in a democracy. Voter suppression takes many forms, including voter ID laws, intimidation tactics, and gerrymandering. Such practices are aimed to keep certain groups of voters from participating in the democratic process and can have a negative impact on voter turnout. The voter ID laws, for instance, require voters to show some form of identification before voting. While this seems like a straightforward requirement, many Americans lack the necessary identification documentation or face difficulties obtaining it, which makes voting difficult.
The decline in voter participation in America can also be attributed to widespread cynicism about the political system. Many Americans believe that politicians and the government do not represent their interests, leading to a belief that their vote does not matter. This belief can lead to voter apathy, and many people opt out of the democratic process altogether. Since many Americans feel that the political process is so corrupt and that politicians do not represent their interests, they may see voting as an exercise in futility.
The fear of exposure and repercussions is also a significant factor contributing to the declining voter participation in America. Some Americans prefer to keep their political opinions to themselves to avoid confrontations or retribution from colleagues, employers, or family members. The phenomenon has increased significantly with the advent of social media, where opinions and political affiliations can be a source of conflict. As a result, many people choose to avoid political engagement altogether, including voting, to minimize conflicts and avoid confrontation with others.
Finally, the decline in voter participation in America can also be attributed to the lack of civic education. Many Americans lack an adequate understanding of the democratic process and how it works. The current education system can not equip students with the knowledge and skills required to engage in civic activities actively. Civic education is essential in ensuring that citizens understand the importance of voting and participating in the democratic process. Without sufficient civic education, many Americans do not realize the significance of voting or how their participation can impact the country's future.
In conclusion, voter participation in America has been declining significantly over the years. The complex and outdated electoral system, politicization of voting, voter suppression, widespread cynicism, fear of exposure, and lack of civic education all contribute to this decline. Reversing the trend and increasing voter turnout in America will require significant effort to reform America's political system. Reforms and changes aimed at simplifying the electoral process, reducing voter suppression, promoting civic education, and reducing the political divide are necessary to rebuild American democracy and increase voter turnout. America must prioritize and protect its democratic values to ensure that all citizens can participate equally in the democratic process and have a say in the governance of the country.
