Economic globalisation is the process of expanding economic relationships between countries. It involves the growth and integration of national economies into a global marketplace. The extent of economic globalisation can be traced back to the nineteenth century, when countries began to trade with each other extensively. However, with technological advancements, globalisation has accelerated at an unprecedented pace in the past two decades.
Economic globalisation has contributed significantly to the growth of world trade, investments, and international exchange of goods and services. The interconnectivity of economies across the world has resulted in lower costs of production and access to resources, resulting in greater efficiency and increased innovation. The standard of living has improved due to access to more affordable goods and services. Furthermore, economic globalisation has created more job opportunities in developed and developing countries alike.
While there are many benefits to economic globalisation, there are also concerns surrounding the power of nation-states. The globalisation of the economy has meant that nation-states have had to compete with each other on an equal level. It has blurred the lines of power between states and international institutions; challenging the traditional authority of nation-states. Nation-states must adapt to the global economic system or face the risk of being left behind in an increasingly competitive world.
According to Kenichi Ohmae, "in terms of global economy, nation states have become little more than bit actors." The statement means that the role of nation-states in the global market is becoming smaller and less influential. While nation-states remain the primary source of political power, their influence is limited when it comes to global markets. The global economy is controlled by multinational corporations, international organizations, and technological advancements.
However, the power of nation-states is not entirely obsolete. Nation-states still possess their sovereign power over several areas such as national security and the use of domestic resources. Additionally, nation-states still provide an essential role in the management of a country's affairs, such as the regulation of labor and environmental protection.
In conclusion, economic globalisation has had a profound impact on the power of nation-states. Technological advancements and access to international markets have resulted in economic growth and increased globalization across the globe. Nation-states must adapt to the global economic system to survive; otherwise, they risk fading into irrelevance. Kenichi Ohmae's statement on the role of nation-states in the global economy may be true to some extent, but it is still essential to recognize the sovereign power of nation-states and their importance in regulating domestic affairs.
