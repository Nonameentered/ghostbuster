Introduction
Leaving home for the first time can be a significant transition for young females, especially when they are moving away to attend university. This transition includes unfamiliar experiences, such as living without parental supervision, adapting to a new environment, and making new friends. One significant change that accompanies this transition is a shift in eating behaviors. This essay assesses the effects of moving away from home for the first time on the eating behaviors of first-year university females compared to a control group of non-university females. It also examines the relationship between low self-esteem, integration into a new peer group, and disordered eating behaviors among this population. Furthermore, the essay discusses the broader societal factors influencing eating pathology.
Effect of Moving Away from Home on Eating Behaviors
Moving away from home for the first time can be both exciting and stressful. For many young females, leaving home marks the first time they must make their own decisions about their diets. The transition to university life typically involves acquiring independence, living away from home, and taking control of personal budgets. Consequently, eating patterns of first-year university students change to reflect their newfound autonomy.
There is a growing body of research supporting the notion that a significant shift in eating behavior occurs after a female leaves home for university. A study conducted by Quick, Byrd-Bredbenner, and White (2013) revealed that moving away from home to attend a university resulted in riskier eating behaviors among college females. Their study showed that female university students consumed a higher amount of fast food, energy-dense snacks, and sugary drinks compared to those who continued living at home. This change was attributed to having access to an abundance of food, being responsible for their own meals, and socializing with peers who had differing eating habits.
Control Group of Non-university Females
To bolster the comparison and provide accurate results, it is essential to create a control group of non-university females. According to the available research, non-university female students are less likely to experience significant change in their eating patterns than university females. Most of them still live at home, have structured routines, and rely on parents or guardians to prepare their meals. Thus, because of the absence of a significant lifestyle change, non-university female students may not affect their eating behaviors as much as their university counterparts.
Low Self-esteem and Integration into a New Peer Group
Leaving home for the first time can be overwhelming and stressful as it requires adapting to a new environment, making friends, and building a social network. This new social network plays a critical role in shaping a female student's eating habits. Women who are adjusting to university life may feel pressure to conform to the eating patterns of their peers. This pressure can be particularly high if the new social network is composed of students with disordered eating behaviors.
Low self-esteem has been linked to the development of disordered eating behaviors (Smink, Haines, Jackson, & Ciciolla, 2011). Young females who experience low self-esteem may be at greater risk of developing eating disorders due to the desire to attain the thin ideal and a negative body image. Integration into a new peer group during the transition to university life may exacerbate this risk. Such females may feel pressure to conform to their peers' body images and ideals, leading to disordered eating behaviors.
Societal Factors Influencing Eating Pathology
Eating disorders and other disordered eating patterns are not caused by a single factor alone. Many broader societal factors influence the development of eating pathology. Among these factors are media messages, family influences, cultural standards, and the availability of foods.
One significant factor influencing the development of eating pathology is media messages. For example, advertisements promoting diet products and exercise programs, movie and television stars' body images, and social media posts written by influencers. These advertisements, images, and posts often promote unrealistic thinness ideals and often glorify extreme thinness.
Moreover, the family's influence is also a significant predictor of eating pathology (Friedman, Sharma, & Brownell, 2018). Research indicates that the relationships between parents and children are significant factors that influence female adolescents' eating behaviors. Children whose parents have high parenting styles, which include over-emphasizing appearance and weight, are at higher risk of developing eating disorders.
Furthermore, cultural standards play an essential role in eating pathology. Living in a culture that values thinness and places enormous importance on appearance can increase the pressure for females to pursue an unrealistic body ideal. For example, a study by Smink et al. (2011) showed that women from an Asian background who migrated to the US had a higher risk of developing eating disorders than native-born Americans.
Finally, a society with easy accessibility to unhealthy foods can increase the risk of eating pathology. The availability of fast food and unhealthy energy-dense snacks can foster habits that are detrimental to individuals' health and increase the risk of developing pathological eating behaviors.
Conclusion
In conclusion, moving away from home for the first time can bring about significant changes in the eating behaviors of university female students. This essay has compared the eating behaviors of first-year university female students to non-university students, revealing that the former group had riskier eating behaviors. Furthermore, the essay has examined the impact of low self-esteem and integration into a new peer group on the development of disordered eating behaviors among university female students. Moreover, the broader societal factors influencing eating pathology, including media messages, family influences, cultural standards, and the availability of foods, have been discussed. It is essential for parents, universities, and society at large to recognize the difficulties female students face when transitioning to university life to provide critical support that can help prevent pathological eating behaviors.
