The ability to read is integral to our daily lives. It enables us to acquire knowledge, express ourselves, and communicate with others. There are two main routes involved in the teaching of reading: the phonetic or decoding route, and the whole language or meaning-centered route. Both routes are important for effective reading, but to varying degrees.
The phonetic or decoding route teaches students to associate the sounds of words with their written forms. It focuses on teaching phonics, which involves learning the letter-sound relationships and how to blend them together to read unfamiliar words. The whole language or meaning-centered route, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of making sense of what is read. It encourages students to use context clues, such as the meaning of the sentence or the surrounding text, to decipher unfamiliar words.
While both routes are important, research has shown that readers rely heavily on decoding skills. Skilled readers decode automatically and fluently, while less skilled readers often struggle with decoding, especially when encountering unfamiliar words. In fact, research has found that the ability to decode accurately and efficiently is one of the strongest predictors of overall reading ability.
This challenges the common misconception that context is the most important factor in reading comprehension. While context can be helpful, skilled readers do not rely on it as heavily as less skilled readers. Instead, they use their decoding skills to quickly and accurately recognize words, allowing them to focus on the meaning of the text.
Another factor that affects reading ability is eye movements. Skilled readers make fewer and shorter fixations, or pauses, during reading, allowing them to read more efficiently. They are also better able to use their peripheral vision, which allows them to take in more information in a single fixation. Less skilled readers, on the other hand, tend to have longer fixations and are more likely to regress, or go back and reread parts of the text.
Working memory also plays a role in reading ability. Skilled readers have more efficient working memory, which allows them to hold and process more information at once. This enables them to quickly make connections between different parts of the text and understand the overall meaning. Less skilled readers, on the other hand, may struggle to process and retain information, which can interfere with their comprehension.
Overall, the teaching of reading involves both the phonetic or decoding route and the whole language or meaning-centered route. While both routes are important, readers rely heavily on decoding skills, especially skilled readers. Context can be helpful, but it is not the most important factor in reading comprehension. Eye movements and working memory also play a role in reading ability, with skilled readers demonstrating more efficient use of both.
In conclusion, effective reading requires a combination of decoding skills, the ability to make sense of context, efficient eye movements, and strong working memory. The teaching of reading should focus on developing these skills, with an emphasis on phonics instruction to improve decoding ability. Skilled reading involves more than just recognizing words, but also making connections between different parts of the text and understanding the overall meaning. By understanding these factors, we can better support and improve reading ability for all.
