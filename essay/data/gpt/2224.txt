Since the twentieth century, the scientific world has puzzled about the existence of dark matter. Entangled in the mysterious and hidden side of the universe, dark matter is one of the most enigmatic objects that science has ever uncovered. It is an elusive substance that is invisible to the naked eye and can only be detected through its gravitational effects on visible matter. Scientists predict that dark matter accounts for over 80% of the universe's matter content and plays a crucial role in determining the fate of the universe. This essay will discuss what dark matter is, its types, and the three main discrepancies in astronomical observations that led to its discovery. Moreover, it will explain the different models of the universe's fate based on the density of dark matter and the critical value.
To begin with, dark matter is essentially a substance whose particles do not interact with light or any other electromagnetic radiation, making it nearly invisible. Dark matter earns its name from observations that reveal that many galaxies are speeding away from each other at a faster rate than gravity alone would allow. These observations have led scientists to believe that something must be out there, undiscovered, or unseen, accounting for the extra gravitational pull needed to hold these galaxies together. Dark matter is nothing like the matter that we encounter in our everyday experiences. It is made out of exotic materials that are several times heavier than ordinary matter, so it has an immense gravitational effect on objects around it, overwhelming the effect of ordinary matter.
There are two types of dark matter: hot and cold dark matter. Hot dark matter is made up of particles that move at high speeds, close to the speed of light. These particles are light and interact only with other particles with a high-speed force, which makes them difficult to detect. Cold dark matter, on the other hand, is composed of slow-moving particles, with a mass greater than hot dark matter. These particles interact through gravity, which combines well with the properties of cold dark matter and its gravitational effect.
The discovery of dark matter came from three main discrepancies in astronomical observations. The first was the rotation curve of spiral galaxies. If the mass of invisible matter within a galaxy is negligible, then the visible matter should move at the same speed and behave as a rigid body. Instead, it rotates faster at the periphery, challenging the law of gravity. The second discrepancy was the dynamic of clusters of galaxies. The mass of a cluster is around the same as that of thousands of galaxies' together, but only a small portion of the cluster's visible mass. Therefore, the cluster would move apart if it was unable to exert gravitational forces, which observatory data proves incorrect. Lastly, observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation reveal that the universe's matter (both visible and dark) has a low density, indicating the existence of more massive particles.
The role of dark matter in the fate of the universe is an exciting topic of research and debate for astrophysicists. Everyone in the field agrees that dark matter plays a prominent role in determining the fate of the universe, but the results vary based on different scientific models. Dark matter's influence remains an essential factor primarily because of the massive amount of mass it contains, which determines the universe's expansion history by gravitational forces. According to current theories, if the universe contains enough matter, it will slow down after an initial expansion and eventually collapse. Alternatively, if the universe's matter is insufficient, expansion will continue, and the universe will tear itself apart.
There are three different models of the universe's fate based on the density of dark matter and the critical value: open, closed, and flat. If the universe's density is below the critical value, the model is open, and the universe expands forever. If the density is above the critical value, the model is closed, and the universe eventually contracts into a singularity, also known as the "Big Crunch." Lastly, if the density perfectly matches the critical value, the universe's expansion becomes balanced and stops in the model flat. Each model's results can differ based on the density of dark matter, which, in turn, reveals numerous implications for the universe's fate.
In the Open Model, dark matter is less densely distributed than the ideal value. This condition leads to a universe with too little mass to stop the expansion. Thus, the rate of expansion accelerates, and the universe continues to expand, but not enough to create a Big Crunch event. Eventually, galaxies will interact less, and the universe will reach a state of maximal entropy, losing kinetic energy and becoming an extremely cold place.
The closed model proposes that the universe's density is higher than ideal, leading to a universe with too much dark matter for the rate of expansion to continue at its present rate; instead, it will slow down in the expansion. Then, slowly, gravity will take over and cause the universe to collapse without resistance. The universe will contract, and objects will collide in an event known as the Big Crunch.
Lastly, the flat model assumes the universe's density is exactly what is needed to balance gravity and slow down the rate of expansion enough to balance out. As such, the universe largely stops expanding and merely meanders along at a steady rate. This model suggests that the universe will become infinite, densely populated with galaxy clusters, and continues to generate gas and stars indefinitely.
In conclusion, dark matter has revolutionized our understanding of the universe. Although undetectable, dark matter accounts for more than 80% of the universe's matter content, overweeningly affects gravitational forces, and plays an essential role in determining the universe's fate. The discovery of dark matter stems from the three main discrepancies in astronomical observations that led to a profound shift in the way scientists view the universe. The debate continues on the models of the universe's fate based on the density of dark matter and the critical value - open, closed, and flat. While each model has different implications for the universe's fate, one thing is clear - dark matter is the driving force that shapes the universe around us, and its enigmatic nature provides endless avenues of research for scientists to explore.
