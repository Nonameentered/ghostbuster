The way children behave is often shaped by the world around them. One powerful influence is the media they consume, specifically films and television programs. While some studies suggest that the impact of watching aggression in films and on television may be neutral, there is increasing evidence to suggest that it can have a negative impact on children. This essay examines the theories proposed to explain why children may learn to be more aggressive through watching aggression on screen. It also looks at how psychological research has attempted to address concerns about the impact of aggressive images on television, and the immediate and long-term effects such exposure has on children's aggression levels. Also, it highlights the differences between indirect and physical aggression and identifies which type of aggression is of more concern to parents.
One of the most popular theories put forward to explain how children may learn to be more aggressive through watching aggression on screen is social learning theory. This theory posits that children learn by modeling other people in their environment, particularly those who are an authority figure. Albert Bandura, a social psychologist, conducted a famous experiment popularly known as the "Bobo Doll" experiment. In the experiment, children watched an adult play with a doll in either an aggressive or non-aggressive way. Afterward, the children were given the doll to play with. The study found that the children who had observed aggressive behavior were more likely to mimic that behavior while playing with the doll. The experiment demonstrated that children learned through observation and imitation of behavior models.
Another theory that has been proposed is the desensitization theory. This theory suggests that children become desensitized to violent imagery with repeated exposure to violent media. Over time, they stop responding to violence on screen as negatively as they once did. Desensitization may occur if children's most common interaction with violent imagery is through the media, causing the images to lose their impact over time. This can be particularly alarming because desensitization may lead to an increase in the incidence and severity of aggressive behavior.
Despite the growing concerns about the impact of aggressive images on television, psychological research has attempted to address these concerns through various studies. Some of the studies indicate that there is a link between watching aggression on television and increased aggression in children. For example, the National Television Violence Study conducted by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found a direct correlation between the amount of violence children watched and aggression levels. Children who watched a lot of violent media exhibited higher levels of aggression than those who watched less.
However, other studies have suggested that the link between watching aggression and increased aggression may not be as straightforward as it seems. A study conducted by the University of Michigan found that the impact of aggression in media can depend on various factors such as the child's age, gender, and temperament. It also depends on the context in which the aggression is presented, which may vary between programs. The study found that children who were already predisposed to violent behavior were more likely to be influenced by aggressive media than those who were not.
The immediate effects of violent television on children's aggression levels are better documented than the long-term effects. The immediate effects can range from increased aggression to decreased prosocial behavior. If a child receives constant exposure to violent media, they may be more likely to display aggressive behavior, such as hitting, shouting, and getting into physical fights. Conversely, exposure to prosocial media can result in an increased willingness to help others and more cooperative behavior. Some studies suggest that long-term exposure to violent media can result in aggressive behavior that persists into adolescence and adulthood.
Indirect and physical aggression differ in their effects on children's behavior. Physical aggression refers to behavior that inflicts some form of physical harm to the recipient. Indirect aggression is behavior that is not explicitly violent or confrontational, such as gossiping or spreading malicious rumors. Physical aggression clearly poses a physical danger to victims, and it is often the subject of media criticism. However, research has shown that indirect aggression can be equally damaging, if not more so than physical aggression, particularly in pre-adolescent and adolescent girls. This is because indirect aggression may be less noticeable to adults since it occurs in non-physical ways, making it more difficult to detect and address. Parents may be more concerned about physical aggression because of its potential for physical harm and the frequency with which it is represented in the media.
In conclusion, the impact of aggression in films and on television on children's behavior is a topic that has been subject to much research. Social learning theory and desensitization theory provide explanations for why children may learn to be more aggressive through watching aggression on-screen. Psychological research has attempted to address concerns about the impacts of aggressive images by examining the effect of age, gender, temperament, and other factors. The immediate effects of violent television on children's aggression levels and the long-term effects they may have on their behavior have both been documented. Indirect and physical aggression differ in their effects on children's behavior and are of concern to different degrees for parents. Considering the increasing amount of violence in media, it is essential to continue investigating the effects of such media on children's behavior and take steps to limit its negative influence when necessary.
