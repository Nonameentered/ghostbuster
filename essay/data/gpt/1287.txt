Neurasthenia, which can be defined as a medical condition characterized by symptoms such as mental exhaustion, depression and chronic fatigue, emerged as a diagnostic category in the late 19th century in the United States and was commonly diagnosed until the 1920s. The diagnosis of neurasthenia became popular during an era when the demands of industrialization and urbanization, combined with cultural changes in American society, created new stresses and anxieties. However, the extent to which neurasthenia is a socially constructed disorder, rather than a genuine medical condition, has been debated by scholars for many years. This essay will explore the notion of neurasthenia as a socially constructed disorder, examining how socio-cultural factors influenced the emergence and diagnosis of this condition and how it reflects the cultural anxieties of the era it emerged from.
Firstly, it is useful to consider the medical and social context in which neurasthenia emerged. During the late 19th century, scientific medicine was emerging as an increasingly dominant paradigm. In particular, the model of medicine that viewed the body as a machine that could be analyzed and treated with new technologies and surgical procedures became dominant. This was also the era in which there was a significant shift from rural to urban lifestyles, with people moving to cities to work in factories and urban industries. This transition brought about significant changes, including increased competition, longer working hours, and increased stress and anxiety. These sociocultural changes led to the emergence of neurasthenia as a diagnostic category, as people struggled to adjust to the new lifestyles and demands.
The diagnosis of neurasthenia was popularized by George Beard, an American physician who first published a description of the condition in 1869. Beard argued that neurasthenia was caused by “…nervous energy depletion and was caused by the stresses of modern life” (Shorter, 1997, p.27). Beard’s diagnosis of neurasthenia coincided with growing concerns about modernity and its impact on human health. Medical practitioners had become increasingly concerned with the well-being of individuals in an era marked by rapid industrialization and urban growth. The newly established medical profession focused heavily on addressing physical health problems, which meant that mental health issues were often ignored or undervalued.
However, some scholars have argued that the diagnosis of neurasthenia was also a way to medicalize social concerns and anxieties. The diagnosis of neurasthenia offered a way to medicalize what might have been regarded as individual or social problems. It allowed people to attribute their anxieties, depression, and fatigue to a medical condition. The diagnosis of neurasthenia also served to legitimize physicians’ authority over mental health issues and to establish a new power dynamic between health professionals and patients. Historian Benjamin Reiss argues, “neurasthenia demanded a specific response from physicians who could prescribe tailored regimens of rest, exercise and medical treatments, as well as reinforce the authority of medical knowledge and the appropriate role of medical practitioners” (Reiss, 2005, p. 195).
Further evidence of neurasthenia’s socially constructed nature is found in the fact that it was a gendered diagnosis. Women were more likely than men to be diagnosed with neurasthenia, a phenomenon that can be explained through an examination of gender roles and expectations in late 19th and early 20th-century American society. Women were expected to adhere to societal norms of domesticity, sacrificing their own needs and desires to care for their husbands and children. These social expectations placed significant pressures on women, which contributed to the development of neurasthenia. Women’s neurasthenia was generally attributed to being overworked, “nervous,” and incompatible with their gender roles. Women were often confined to long periods of bed rest and provided with sedatives to calm their nerves, which can be seen as a gendered response to a socially constructed disorder.
Furthermore, the diagnosis of neurasthenia was not without its critics. Critics at the time often argued that neurasthenia was not a genuine medical condition but instead a product of moral degeneration. Neurasthenia was often associated with wealthy individuals who had access to the best medical care. Other critics argued that the diagnosis of neurasthenia was nothing more than a label given to people who did not fit easily into the existing social norms and expectations.
In conclusion, the extent to which neurasthenia is a socially constructed disorder cannot be denied. The diagnosis of this condition represented a response to the rapidly changing social, political, and economic conditions of the late 19th and early 20th centuries in America. While it is undoubtedly true that people experienced very real symptoms of exhaustion, anxiety, and depression in this era, there is also evidence that the medicalization of these symptoms was a socially constructed response. The diagnosis of neurasthenia legitimized the medical profession’s authority over mental health issues and served to reinforce gendered societal norms. As society continues to place more emphasis on diagnosing and treating mental health conditions, it is essential to reflect on how these diagnoses relate to broader socio-cultural changes and how they may be shaped by social constructions and expectations.
