Introduction
Spoken discourse is an integral part of human communication. It plays a significant role in shaping interpersonal relationships, conveying social meanings and cultural values. The way people speak to each other varies depending on the context and situation. For instance, conversations can take place in formal or informal settings, and as a result, the type of language and communication style used differs. This essay seeks to analyze two pieces of spoken discourse, one from an informal conversation and the other from a formal political radio interview, to examine the differences in language choice, style, and features. Additionally, the essay will explore how different linguistic approaches such as ethnography of speaking and conversation analysis help in analyzing these spoken discourses.
Informal Conversation
The informal conversation chosen for analysis is taken from a group of friends who are sitting in a coffee shop. The conversation is centered on movies, and they are discussing the latest blockbusters to hit the cinema. The conversation is between four friends, two males and two females, all in their early twenties.
The conversation starts with one of the friends, a male, expressing his excitement about the latest superhero movie that he had watched. He goes on to describe the plot of the movie, its characters, and how excited he was to watch it. The other friends in the group contribute by expressing their opinions, commenting on the acting skills of the actors, and comparing it to other movies in the same genre. The conversation is lively, and the tone is casual and informal. The participants are using slang, colloquialisms and sometimes vulgar language to communicate their views. For example, when one of the male friends describes a particular action scene in the movie, he uses the phrase, “It was effing amazing.”
The participants in the conversation use a lot of non-verbal cues, such as facial expressions, eye contact, and body language to convey their thoughts. The participants interrupt each other frequently, and they talk over each other. This indicates that they are comfortable with each other and that they are not following a strict turn-taking pattern.
Formal Political Radio Interview
The formal political radio interview is an excerpt from a radio show featuring a prominent politician. The host is interviewing the politician, and the topic of discussion is the government's economic policy. The interview is taking place in a recording studio, and the participants are aware that their conversation is being recorded for broadcast.
The tone of the conversation is formal, and the participants refrain from using slang, colloquialisms, or vulgar language. The language choice is very formal, and the participants are using complex sentence structures and technical terms to explain their positions. The politician is using the language of politics, discussing policy issues, and presenting his views on the government's economic policy.
The conversation takes a question-answer format, and turn-taking is strictly observed. The host asks a question, and the politician takes his time to respond and clarify his views. Additionally, the participants use a lot of verbal cues, such as introductions, rephrasing, and repetition of words, to convey their thoughts. For example, the host uses an introduction to ask the politician about his views on the government's fiscal policies, “Speaking of fiscal policies, can you tell us your thoughts on the subject.”
Differences between the Two Discourses
There are several differences between the two pieces of spoken discourse explored. The most significant difference is the level of formality in the language used. The informal conversation is relaxed, and participants are using colloquial language, whereas the formal political radio interview is highly formal, with participants using proper language and complex sentence structures.
In the informal conversation, the participants' tone is casual, and they are comfortable with each other, which is reflected in their use of interruption, overlapping speech, and informal language. In contrast, in the formal political radio interview, the tone is professional, and participants are cautious about their choice of language and body language, which is reflected in their use of technical terms, strict turn-taking, and clear enunciation of words. 
Another significant difference is the use of verbal and nonverbal cues. In the informal conversation, participants frequently use nonverbal cues such as facial expressions, eye contact, and body language to convey their thoughts. However, in the formal political interview, the participants use verbal cues such as repetition of words, introductions, and rephrasing to convey their thoughts as nonverbal cues might not be picked up by the listener. 
Linguistic Approaches to the Analysis of Spoken Discourses
There are several linguistic approaches that can be used in the analysis of spoken discourse. Two such approaches are the ethnography of speaking and conversation analysis.
Ethnography of Speaking
The ethnography of speaking is a method used to analyze spoken discourse by examining the social and cultural contexts in which the discourse occurs. It seeks to understand the customs, beliefs, and values that influence language use and the interpretation of meaning. This approach takes into account the social variables that affect the language and communication of individuals. It considers the cultural background, ethnicity, gender, age, and social class of the participants in the discourse. The approach also involves examining the discourse in its full context, including the setting, the participants, and the purpose of the communication.
In the informal conversation analyzed, the application of the ethnography of speaking approach reveals that the participants are all fluent speakers of informal language rooted in a common cultural background. The use of slang and colloquialisms is a reflection of their age group and social background. The spontaneous and relaxed nature of the discourse also reveals that the participants are comfortable with each other, and they are not inhibited in their use of language.
In the formal political radio interview analyzed, the application of the ethnography of speaking approach reveals that the use of formal language is a reflection of the social context of the communication. The participants are aware that the communication is being recorded for a broadcast audience, and as such, they use professional language in their discourse. Additionally, the choice of technical terms is a reflection of the participants' knowledge and expertise in the subject matter.
Conversation Analysis
Conversation Analysis is another approach used to analyze spoken discourse. It examines the structure and function of the discourse in terms of turn-taking, repair, and sequence organization. The approach seeks to understand the rules that govern conversational interactions and how participants use language to achieve their communicative goals.
In the informal conversation analyzed, the participants frequently interrupt each other, talk over each other, and do not observe strict turn-taking. There is also frequent repair, where participants modify their preceding utterance to clarify meaning or correct mistakes. These features of discourse in this conversation reveal that informal conversation is typically less structured, and interruption and overlap are common since this is a showing that the relationship is comfortable. 
In the formal political radio interview analyzed, the participants strictly observe turn-taking, and there are no interruptions or overlap. However, participants carefully modify their language and pay close attention to what is being said to ensure that their responses are appropriate as they are aware that their language is a representation of their thoughts.
Conclusion
In summary, spoken discourse plays a vital role in human interaction, and the approach of language choice and style depends on the context of communication. The differences between the informal conversation and formal political radio interview analyzed are evident in the level of formality exhibited by the participants and the use of verbal and nonverbal cues. The application of linguistic approaches such as ethnography of speaking and conversation analysis provides a deeper understanding of the social and cultural factors influencing language use in different contexts. Therefore, a linguistic analysis of spoken discourses is critical in revealing the complexities of human communication.
