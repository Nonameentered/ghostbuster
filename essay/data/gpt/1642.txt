Keeping track of and totaling ten numbers entered by the user while also keeping track of negative and positive numbers can be achieved in a few simple steps. Firstly, the user must be prompted to input the numbers. Once each number is inputted, it should be stored in an array. This array can then be used to calculate the total sum of all the numbers entered.
To keep track of negative and positive numbers, a conditional statement can be used while the user is inputting the numbers. If the number inputted is less than 0, it is a negative number and can be stored in a separate array for negative numbers. If the number is greater than or equal to 0, it is a positive number and can be stored in a separate array for positive numbers.
Once all ten numbers have been entered and sorted into their respective arrays, the sum of the positive numbers and negative numbers can be calculated separately. To calculate the sum of the positive numbers, a loop can be used to iterate through the positive number array and add each element to the total sum. To calculate the sum of the negative numbers, a similar loop can be used to iterate through the negative number array and subtract each element from the total sum.
Overall, by using an array to store the inputted numbers and conditional statements to sort them into negative and positive arrays, the process of keeping track of and totaling ten numbers while also keeping track of negative and positive numbers can be efficiently achieved.
