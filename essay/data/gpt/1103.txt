The modern variants of the classic two-slit experiment with photons include the delayed-choice experiment, quantum eraser experiment, and the interaction-free measurement experiment. These experiments challenge our understanding of quantum theory and the nature of reality. Delayed choice plays a crucial role in these experiments as it allows us to manipulate the system after the photon was already emitted. The non-intuitive behavior of quantum objects is evident in the interference patterns observed during the two-slit experiment. The explanation for this behavior lies in the wave-particle duality of photons. Interpretations of this explanation range from the Copenhagen interpretation to the Many-Worlds interpretation, with each offering a different perspective on the nature of reality at the quantum level.
