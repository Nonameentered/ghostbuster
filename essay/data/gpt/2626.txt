Introduction
Neanderthals are an extinct species of humans that lived approximately 400,000 to 40,000 years ago in Europe and parts of Asia. The discovery of Neanderthal fossils has greatly contributed to the understanding of human evolution, particularly with regards to the abrupt and often brutal nature of change in biological systems that has been shown to have occurred throughout human history.
In recent times, there has been a renewed interest in Neanderthal anatomy and behaviour, with considerable amounts of research being done on the subject. This is largely because of the new methods and technologies that researchers have developed. Studying the anatomy of Neanderthals can provide valuable insight into their behaviour and way of life, such as their intelligence, hunting capabilities, diet and ability to adapt to rather extreme conditions, thereby enhancing the understanding of the previous era. Thus, this essay takes an in-depth look at the anatomy of Neanderthals and how it can be used to unravel key aspects related to their behaviour and lifestyle.
Neanderthal Cranial Anatomy
One of the most significant aspects of Neanderthal anatomy is their cranial structure. The Neanderthal skull was characterized by notable morphological distinctions from that of anatomically modern humans (AMH). Advanced computer modelling of skull shape has indicated that compared to modern humans, the cranial fossil records are characterized by considerably distinct differences – relating to unique features such as the brow ridge, a distinctive mid-plane bulge above the forehead, and a larger nasal cavity.
The brow ridge, for instance, is much more pronounced in Neanderthals than in AMH. The bone growth indicates the development of massive jaw muscles, suggesting that Neanderthals were powerfully built and that their diet potentially included tough-to-chew foods such as roots, bark, and tough meat. Such traits may indicate that Neanderthals were plantigrade walkers that could move through difficult terrain with ease. Their large brains also suggest that they were not restricted in the way they utilize their cognitive abilities, theoretically leading to a more diverse understanding of the environment in which they lived or inhabited.
The mid-plane bulge, or occipital protuberance, is a prominent ridge on the back of the skull that was more significant in Neanderthals than in AMH's. The reason for this bulge is unknown, but the most commonly given explanation is that it may have facilitated the attachment of strong neck muscles. The structure may have provided Neanderthals with better control over the head and neck, which is crucial for survival in several circumstances. It has been postulated that the larger muscle attachment area in the Neanderthal skull might signify a more developed mental tampering capability, suggesting a more significant sense of prescience in their behaviours and decision-making process. This trait may have been advantageous in practices like hunting and care-giving where quick decisions can make all the difference.
The Neanderthal Brain
The size and structure of the brain play an essential role in determining the behaviour of a species. One of the primary ways that researchers have studied the anatomy of Neanderthals is by creating virtual endocasts of their brains using high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scans. These endocasts are made by taking a mould of the skull's inner surface, which replicates the shape of the brain.
Studies have revealed that, compared to initial humans, Neanderthals had slightly larger brains. However, the Neanderthal brain was constructed differently than that of AMH, with their parietal lobes being relatively more extensive and bulbous’ and temporal lobes being flattened out. Though the reasoning behind the differences in brain size and structure are unknown, researchers suggest that the differences' significance can be attributed to the fact that brain size and structure can affect behavioural patterns.
The larger parietal lobes in Neanderthal brains could indicate better-developed visuospatial abilities, which would have been an advantage in movements across rough terrain, hunting, and navigation. These abilities may have served an important role in Neanderthal group competition for resources in ancient times. As the environment became more hostile, these abilities also played a role in Neanderthal adaptability and ability to cope with the harsh climate. The difference in temporal lobe structure might suggest an adjusting pattern of their sensory or social skillsets, perhaps adapting to increased pressure resulting from a migration of AMH into their territories.
Neanderthal Anatomical Adaptations
Neanderthals were adapted to survive in environments different from those of modern humans. Research suggests that they were specialized to live in cold environments, characterized by low sunlight, high altitudes, and low moisture. One of the primary ways in which they adapted to cold environments was through their body morphology. Compared to modern humans, Neanderthals had shorter limbs- an attribute that allowed them to conserve heat better. Additionally, they had a wide rib cage and a barrel-shaped thorax, which made it easier to breathe in such low-oxygen environments.
Furthermore, research has indicated that Neanderthals had wider nasal bones, which would help them humidify and heat the air they breathe better and reduce respiratory infections. This particular feature might have been particularly important in the temperate woodland that Neanderthals inhabited. Research has also shown how functional armour employed by Neanderthals during hunting serves to protect against harsh conditions. The use of protective gear is somewhat common among Neanderthal fossils, with some wearing armour made from hides and others from antlers and teeth. Neanderthals' armour often seems functional rather than decorative, as it is evident from modifications to indicate repairs and reinforcements.
Neanderthal Skeletal Anatomy
The overall Neanderthal body structure was robust and sturdy, which made them skilled hunters. Compared to modern humans, their bones were thicker, and their muscles attached more strongly to their skeletons, which would have allowed them to use their strength for activities such as hunting big animals. While their broad and squashed feet made them more stable and improved their accuracy regarding balance when crossing challenging terrain had an advantage in hunting.
This anatomical characteristic can be seen in studies of Neanderthal fossils. Damage on their bones caused by some stress caused by physical activity, for instance, show that they had used their hands as tools for striking objects. Similarly, wear on teeth and jaws suggests that Neanderthals processed food with their mouths to prepare it for consumption, potentially using their teeth as tools. These skeletal features demonstrate the wide range of activities that Neanderthals engaged in, from hunting game to preparing their food.
Conversely, despite their robust and sturdy body structure, there were limitations to Neanderthal skeletal anatomy. For instance, the size of their orbits was smaller than anatomically modern humans, which might have led to inferior visual acuity. This fact is seemingly supported by studies indicating that Neanderthals hunted animals at close range, where they could utilize their strength and body mass, rather than hunting from a distance, which necessitates better eyesight. Additionally, the structure of their pelvis and hip joint made bipedal walking less efficient than in modern humans. This specific trait’s significance is not yet clear, but some researchers suggest that Neanderthals’ walking pattern may have led them to use less efficient energy paths.
Conclusion
Studying the anatomy of Neanderthals has allowed researchers to learn more about the behaviour and lifestyle of these early humans. The Neanderthal anatomy significantly influenced the species' behaviour, including their brain structure, which provided enhanced visuospatial abilities and better mental tampering capability, their adaptation to different environments, including harsh and cold environments, and their use of armour for protection. The skeletal structure of Neanderthals and the presence of damage on bones reveal they were skilled hunters, used their hands as tools, and created their tools to facilitate their day-to-day activities, while the size of their orbits may have given them inferior visual acuity. The new knowledge that scientists have achieved in recent years through technological advancements concerning the anatomy of Neanderthals has opened a window into the past, providing key insights into our ancestors' behavioural and lifestyle patterns, feeding our understanding of our relationship with the previous era.
