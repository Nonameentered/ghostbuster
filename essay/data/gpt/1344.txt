Introduction
Beauty adverts have always been a prominent feature in the media landscape. They have a significant role in constructing our understanding of what feminine beauty is. These advertisements are a powerful tool for creating sociocultural norms and expectations around feminine appearance, presenting and reinforcing a specific image of what it means to be a beautiful woman. They are not only designed to sell a product but also shape how we see ourselves and others. Through symbolism, photographic codes, and language, beauty advertisements create perceptions about beauty that we all buy into. This essay analyses the symbolic and photographic codes used in two contrasting beauty adverts in order to identify the predominant ideologies behind them. It also considers areas in which typical feminine beauty is challenged and where it is conformed to, including the use of colour, appearance of human beings, background/setting, lighting/editing, captions/brand names, and linguistic codes. Furthermore, this essay analyzes how advertising perfume as a product is particularly challenging given that it has no denotation.
Construction of Feminine Beauty 
Beauty adverts construct our understanding of beauty by promoting and reinforcing certain beauty standards as a norm for all women to aspire to. The ads present an idealized, perfected image of beauty that is unrealistic and unattainable, leading to women feeling inadequate, dissatisfied, or even disgusted with their own appearance if they don't measure up to these standards. The beauty industry creates and then capitalizes on women's insecurities around body image and appearance, taking advantage of the fact that beauty is often associated with power, success, and social acceptance. Thus, the industry creates a cycle in which women are held captive to the beauty standards they cannot possibly achieve, while also being convinced that they need the products to make them beautiful.
Symbolic and Photographic Codes
Symbolism and photographic codes are powerful tools that beauty advertisements use to construct our understanding of feminine beauty. Advertisements infuse their products with particular meanings intended to evoke emotions and desires that are associated with beauty, youthfulness, and desirability. For example, advertisements use certain colours and images to create a sense of femininity, glamour, and beauty. Soft, pastel colours such as pink, purple, and pale blue are often associated with femininity and are commonly used in advertisements for beauty products aimed at women. Similarly, ads often feature images of women who are young, thin, and conventionally attractive, reinforcing the beauty standard that equates thinness with beauty and attractiveness.
In the two contrasting beauty advertisements that I have analyzed, the symbolic and photographic codes used are different, reflecting contrasting ideologies. The first advertisement is for L'Oreal's "Age Perfect Cell Renewal" skincare range for mature skin. The second advertisement is for a perfume by Jean Paul Gaultier called Scandal. These two advertisements represent two vastly different approaches to the construction of feminine beauty.
The L'Oreal ad has a predominantly pale blue colour scheme, suggesting a sense of calmness and purity that is associated with femininity. The ad features a mature woman in her early 60s, reflecting the target demographic of the product, to avoid ageism. The woman is presented in a gentle and natural setting, wearing muted colours and minimal makeup, which contrasts with the bold and glamorous images of young models that are typically featured in beauty advertisements. The model is also shown without any airbrushing or editing, which is unusual in beauty ads that typically depict an idealized, perfected version of beauty. This approach to advertising is challenging the traditional beauty standards of youth and perfection and promoting a more natural and authentic sense of beauty that celebrates women of all ages.
On the other hand, the Scandal perfume ad is bold and unabashedly sexual, challenging the traditional norms attached to feminine beauty. The ad features a woman with a voluptuous figure, who is wearing a scandalous outfit and a seductive look. Instead of the serene and muted background that L'Oreal uses, Scandal's ad displays bold, complementary colours, and opulence. Although the woman in the ad is conventionally attractive, her body type is not the typical thin or hourglass figure of traditional beauty standards. Instead, her luscious curves and provocative manner are intended to challenge the viewer's perceptions of beauty and sexuality. The perfume is also shown as a bottle shaped like a female silhouette, playing on the idea of the scent as a woman's sensual power. 
In both advertisements, the use of symbolic and photographic codes has a significant impact on the messages being presented. They both utilize colour, setting, and the appearance of human beings to convey an ideology about what feminine beauty represents. While the L'Oreal ad is promoting authenticity and natural beauty despite aging, the Scandal perfume ad challenges the social norms attached to femininity and beauty by portraying it through a sexual lens. 
Use of Colour
The use of colour is a vital element in beauty advertisements. The colours used, whether bright, muted, or contrasting, can signal emotions, and create a specific mood. As previously mentioned, pastel and feminine colours are often associated with femininity, while darker, richer colours are associated with sensuality.
In the L'Oreal advertisement, the colour scheme is predominantly pale blue, signaling a sense of calmness and purity that is associated with femininity. The blue colour scheme as a whole represents trust, security, and a calmed state of mind. This colour selection is appropriate, given that the ad is targeting older women and their skin-care products. On the other hand, the Scandal perfume ad has a contrasting, bold, and high-contrast colour scheme. The use of deep blue and bright red creates a sense of seduction and sensuality that is associated with the scent. The colours signal power, passion, and lust, which is appropriate given the sexual connotation of the name Scandal perfume.
Appearance of Human Beings
The appearance of human beings in beauty advertisements has become a crucial element in advertising. In the context of female beauty, the type of person that is used to sell the product significantly influences viewers' perceptions of what is beautiful. Beauty advertisements often feature young, thin, conventionally attractive women, setting up an unattainable standard for beauty. Furthermore, since the advertisements are highly edited and airbrushed, it creates unrealistic expectations for people who don't measure up to these standards.
The L'Oreal advertisement features an older woman, who is prominently displayed as confident and comfortable in her skin. This approach to advertising is different from other beauty ads that usually show young and conventionally attractive models, who are glamorized with editing and airbrushing. This ad presents aging skin more naturally, without the stereotypes of undereye bags, wrinkles and age spots. The model appears as an authentic representation of an older woman, standing out from other beauty advertisements that tend to stigmatize or shame aging women. This approach challenges the traditional beauty standards and celebrates older women's natural beauty.
The Scandal perfume ad features a sexualized portrayal of a woman with a voluptuous figure and wearing titillating clothing. This depiction of femininity in the advertisement is directly contrarian to the typical standards held up by beauty advertisements, which showcase skinny and conventionally attractive women in glamorous settings. Scandal's advertisement challenges the primal expectation that shames women for their sexual desires and displaying their sensuality. By portraying an unconventional body type as sexy, this ad promotes a more inclusive beauty standard.
Background and Setting
The background and setting a beauty advertisement provide a context. A set that is bold or abstract can draw viewers' attention to the product, while a natural, muted setting can paint a sense of calmness. The setting and background used in beauty advertisements help to inform our understanding of beauty as it connects the brand image with a particular perception of beauty.
The L'Oreal advertisement uses a natural, muted setting that reflects the natural beauty of aging women. The vibrant garden and the vast sky in the picture evokes a sense of pleasantness and calmness. The ad is set in a natural environment that reflects the harmony between nature and the body. This approach is intended to break down stereotypes associated with aging, conveying a message that beauty is natural and authentic and is not limited to youthfulness.
In contrast, the Scandal perfume ad juxtaposes dark and bright backgrounds with the perfume bottle shaped like a woman's silhouette. The contrast between the woman's shape and the unconventional setting of the advertisement draws attention to the product and gives it an edge. The contrasting high-contrast colours and the sharpness conveys the perfume as something that is bold and audacious, as the perfume's name suggests.
Lighting and Editing
In beauty advertisements, the use of lighting and editing is often exaggerated. This technique is used to give an illusion of perfection. Editing is often used to remove any imperfections in the model's face or skin, making them look flawless. Lighting is used to highlight certain features like the lips or eyes and create a sense of allure.
The L'Oreal advertisement is distinctive in that it represents natural and authentic beauty instead of artificial and exaggerated. No cropping or airbrushing is done in the model's skin. The lighting is soft and natural to convey a sense of tranquillity that is associated with nature. This approach represents a significant departure from the traditional approach of beauty advertising, which fetishizes youth and perfection.
In the Scandal advertisement, the editing and lighting used are intended to create a sense of seductiveness and appeal. The lights are low in the background to create a high contrast between the figure and the background. The editing and retouching emphasise the deep skin tone and the sexiness of the woman. The glossy finish of the ad and the high contrast depicts the perfume as something meant for a woman who wants to make a powerful statement.
Captions/Brand Names and Linguistic Codes
Captions and brand names in beauty advertisements are as important as the visual aspect of the ad. Brand names are used to create a connection and personal appeal to the product, and captions are used to evoke emotions or abstract ideals like beauty, confidence, and elegance. Advertising language is carefully formulated to enhance a product's appeal.
The L'Oreal advertisement's caption is "Rediscover radiance," and the brand name is "Age Perfect." This caption highlights a natural and holistic influence, which suggests that aging is not negative but normal, and skin-care routines are followed to restore the natural radiance. The use of the term "perfect" is meant to challenge traditional beauty standards by transcending the idea that only young women can meet the beauty standard. The brand also seeks to create a sense of trust and professionalism, positioning the products as innovative and tested.
In the Scandal perfume ad, the caption reads "Be scandalous." This caption plays up the perfume's provocative nature, evoking excitement and lust in the viewer. The Scandal brand name focuses on the audaciousness and rule-breaking nature of the perfume, positioning it as a product that is not meant for everyone. The linguistic codes used convey a sense of confidence, self-assuredness, and a willingness to break the rules to arouse desire.
Perfume and Advertising 
Perfume is a challenging product to advertise since it has no denotation, unlike skincare and makeup products. It's a product that is meant to create an abstract feeling or an implication with no evocation. Instead, perfume's ads thrive on symbols and subjective interpretations of what fragrances represent.
In the Scandal advertisement, the perfume bottle is shaped like a woman's silhouette, and the ad is presented in a challenging and provocative way. These elements aim to make viewers associate the fragrance with sex appeal and sensuality. The ad's message is that the perfume can awaken feelings of desire and thrill in women, suggesting that Scandal scent is a powerful way to express sexual appeal and boldness, making it a necessity.
Conclusion 
In conclusion, beauty advertisements have a significant role in shaping society's perceptions of feminine beauty. Through the use of symbolic and photographic codes, beauty ads manifest an abstract idea of what is beautiful and desirable based on a prescribed, unattainable standard. The advertisements analyzed in this essay embrace a contrasting approach when it comes to the prominence of conventionally attractive models, use of colour, setting, lighting, captions/brand names, and linguistic codes. The L'Oreal and Scandal ads represent different ideologies of beauty, challenged and conforming to traditional beauty standards. The language used is designed to create personal appeal, confidence, and create an irresistible aesthetic. Advertising perfume is particularly challenging as it has no direct association. However, the Scandal perfume advertisement successfully evokes sensuality, sex appeal, and boldness through symbolization, shapes, and colors. Overall, beauty advertising plays a vital role in shaping perceptions around femininity, creating a powerful impact on women's self-esteem and expectations of beauty.
