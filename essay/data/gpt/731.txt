The Victorian era was marked by a period of religious uncertainty, which came to be known as the Victorian crisis of faith. This crisis was brought about by a number of factors, including scientific advancements, biblical criticism, and the growing influence of secularism. The effects of this crisis were felt in all aspects of Victorian society, including its literature. In this essay, I will examine how the Victorian crisis of faith influenced the works of George Eliot and Thomas Hardy.
The Victorian crisis of faith was influenced by a wide range of new ideas that were emerging at the time. One of the most significant of these was the theory of evolution, which challenged traditional religious beliefs about the origins of life and the place of humans in the universe. Many Victorian intellectuals were also becoming skeptical about the Bible, as new forms of biblical criticism began to emerge. This led to a growing sense of uncertainty about the validity of religious beliefs, and a questioning of traditional Christian doctrines.
George Eliot was one of the most important literary figures of the Victorian era, and her works are often seen as reflections of the crisis of faith that was gripping society at the time. In her novel Middlemarch, Eliot explores the tensions between science and religion, and the growing sense of doubt that was affecting many Victorian intellectuals. The character of Dorothea serves as a symbol of this uncertainty, as she struggles to reconcile her desire for spiritual fulfillment with her skepticism about traditional religious beliefs.
Eliot's own views on religion were complex, and it is clear from her works that she was struggling with many of the same questions that were troubling her contemporaries. In her essay "Evangelical Teaching," Eliot questions the notion of an all-powerful God who is responsible for the suffering and injustice in the world. Instead, she argues for a more compassionate vision of Christianity, one that emphasizes the importance of tolerance, kindness, and social justice.
Thomas Hardy was another writer who was deeply influenced by the Victorian crisis of faith. His works reflect the growing sense of disillusionment with traditional religion that was taking hold in society at the time. In his novel Jude the Obscure, Hardy explores the conflicts between religion and rationalism, as well as the difficulties faced by those who were trying to forge new paths in the face of the crisis of faith.
The character of Jude serves as a powerful embodiment of this tension between tradition and change. He is torn between his desire for intellectual freedom and his loyalty to his religious upbringing. Ultimately, Jude is unable to reconcile these conflicting impulses, and he becomes a tragic figure caught between two worlds.
Hardy himself was deeply skeptical about organized religion, and his works often focus on the harsh realities of life rather than on spiritual transcendence. In his poem "God's Funeral," Hardy writes about the death of traditional religious belief, and the sense of emptiness and despair that comes with its passing. He sees religion as a kind of illusion that has been shattered by the realities of the modern age, and he mourns the loss of the comfort and meaning that it once provided.
In conclusion, the Victorian crisis of faith had a profound impact on the literature of the time, and on the works of George Eliot and Thomas Hardy in particular. Both writers were grappling with the same questions and concerns that were affecting their contemporaries, and their works reflect the tensions between tradition and change, faith and doubt, and reason and emotion. As the era progressed and new ideas continued to challenge old beliefs, the literature of the Victorian era would continue to evolve and respond to the changing world around it.
