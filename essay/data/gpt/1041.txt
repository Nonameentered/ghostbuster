What defines a person is a question that has intrigued philosophers for centuries. Numerous philosophers have put forth different theories to introduce their understanding of personhood. In this essay, I will discuss the views of Descartes, Strawson, and Foster on what defines a person.
Ren√© Descartes argued that the foundation of personal identity prevails in the mind. In his famous phrase "Cogito Ergo Sum" - "I think, therefore, I am," he implied that he existed as a thinking thing. According to Descartes, an individual's self-awareness was the basic distinction between humans and animals. Since self-consciousness was exclusive to human beings, it was our most essential characteristic.
To explain this concept further, Descartes separated humans into two parts - the mind and the body. He believed the body was subject to decay and death, while the mind, in contrast, was everlasting and immaterial. According to this, bodies could change, but individuals would remain the same. Descartes' definition of personhood had significant implications on the way we approach medical ethics. He believed that an individual could exist with or without a physical body, and hence, he was against the idea of withdrawing life support when there was still brain activity. Descartes' views highlight the significance of self-awareness and consciousness in defining personhood.
In contrast, Galen Strawson believes that it is impossible to split our minds from our bodies. His view proposes a much-enlarged definition, where all living creatures - including plants and animals - are considered persons. Strawson argued that consciousness is a crucial factor in defining personhood since it enables us to perceive and engage with the world. According to Strawson, consciousness is sufficient evidence to consider any living creature as a person since it holds them accountable for their actions.
It might seem strange to label a plant or an animal with the term 'person,' but Strawson believes that the definition of personhood should not be based on the level of intelligence or our capacity to think abstractly. It should be grounded in our ability to experience things and benefit from the concept of conscious experience. Therefore, Strawson's definition of personhood would drastically affect the way we treat and assess the worth of all living creatures.
However, the view of Arthur Foster provides us with a different perspective. He believed that a person's nature was defined by its capacity to reason and communicate. In his opinion, communication was the most critical component of a definition of personhood. Therefore, any entity that could communicate could be considered a person. Foster's definition of personhood emphasized that interactions between subjects could not be merely regarded as a one-way street. Perception was secondary, as communication was the primary force that connected individuals.
Foster believed that the ability to communicate was a more significant aspect of personhood than self-awareness. He thought that if one individual could communicate their feelings, wants, and needs to someone else, the interpersonal connection would become the defining factor of personhood. This mindset highlights one crucial feature of humans - the capacity for empathy and understanding. Foster's approach might not be able to include plants or animals in the definition of personhood, however. Still, it does underscore the importance of relationships between individuals and the necessity of communication in our daily lives.
In conclusion, different philosophers throughout history have presented varying perspectives on what defines a person. Descartes believed that self-awareness and consciousness were the most significant factors. Conversely, Strawson contended that consciousness was sufficient evidence to consider any living creature as a person. Lastly, Foster believed that communication was the primary force that connected individuals and defined personhood. These views provide essential insights into the philosophical discussion of personal identity. So, it will always an interesting and thought-provoking area that may raise many more debates and opinions in the future.
