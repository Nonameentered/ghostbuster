The practical that involved applying the method of nested quadrats had the purpose of assessing the distribution and abundance of plant species in a given area. The expected results were to observe a gradual decrease in the number of plant species with increasing distance from the center of the quadrat. This practical was applied to a beechwood to determine the distribution of trees using plotless sampling. The findings indicated that there was a clumped distribution of beech trees in the beechwood.
The planting of beech trees in the area was primarily due to the hardiness of this species in comparison to other tree species. The different vegetation types that were studied included grassland, heathland, and woodland. The characteristics of these different vegetation types varied based on factors such as soil type, moisture content, and altitude.
Regular burning affects vegetation on Silchester Heath by promoting cyclical succession. This process involves the replacement of one group of primary plants with another group of primary plants over time. The transect that was made through Broadmoor heath had the purpose of assessing the distribution and abundance of underground material such as roots. The results indicated that there was a correlation between the distribution of plant roots and the plant species present in the area.
In conclusion, the practical exercises served the purpose of providing an opportunity to observe and analyze the distribution and abundance of plant species in various environments. The results obtained from these exercises demonstrated the unique characteristics and processes at work in each environment. By understanding the factors that contribute to the distribution and abundance of plant species, we can better understand and manage our environment to ensure the continued health and sustainability of our ecosystems.
