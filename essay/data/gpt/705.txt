Strategies for Capacity Management at the Beefeater Pub:
The management team at the Beefeater pub has put in place several measures to manage the pub's capacity effectively. These measures include better forecasting of customer demand and scheduling of staff to meet the projected demand. The team uses historical data on customer demand and sales to forecast the expected level of demand for different periods of the day.

Additionally, the system allows for the cross-training of staff to enable them to handle different roles during periods of increased demand.
To improve resource utilization, the pub has invested in modern equipment such as point of sale (POS) systems and digital inventory management systems. These systems have made it possible to track inventory levels in real-time, thereby enabling the management team to make informed decisions on ordering supplies.
