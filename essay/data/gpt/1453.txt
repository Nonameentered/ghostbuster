Henrik Ibsen's play 'Ghosts' is a masterpiece of modernist literature. The play is one of the most famous modernist works that challenges the Victorian values and beliefs prevalent during the time in which it was written. It features a cast of characters who struggle with issues such as social norms, religion, gender roles, and morality. There is no clear-cut right or wrong in the play; instead, there are only shades of gray. This essay will analyze the main elements of modernism found in 'Ghosts' and how they challenge Victorian values and beliefs, focusing on the two main characters, Mrs. Alving and Pastor Manders.
The modernist elements found in 'Ghosts' are numerous and essential to the play's theme. One of the primary modernist elements in the play is the rejection of traditional, fixed values in favor of fluidity and ambiguity. In 'Ghosts,' Ibsen challenges the Victorian beliefs and values surrounding gender roles, sexuality, societal norms, and religious dogmas. He does this by portraying characters who defy the norms and values of their society.
Mrs. Alving, the play's protagonist, is an example of a character who challenges Victorian values and beliefs. She is a widow who has devoted her life to raising her son, Oswald, in accordance with conservative Victorian values. However, as the play progresses, she reveals her past experiences, which expose her opposition to societal norms and the expectations placed on her as a woman. She is an independent woman who has struggled with societal expectations, gender inequality, and the patriarchal society. Additionally, she challenges the Victorian values of the family unit as she has confided that she never loved her husband and had an affair with a man who was not her husband.
Pastor Manders, on the other hand, is the other central character in the play. He represents the traditional, conservative, and moralistic clergy. He advocates for adherence to traditional moral values and societal norms. However, he is not as pure as he seems on the surface. He indulges in lust for Mrs. Alving, which goes against his religious beliefs and moral values. He also endorses sexual repression and encourages the strict application of societal norms to the people of the town, thinking it best for societal harmony.
The issue of sexuality is another significant modernist element in 'Ghosts' that is highlighted in the play's characters. The play portrays characters who challenge the sexual roles and restrictions that Victorian society has imposed on them. Mrs. Alving, who had an illicit affair and was punished by society for it, calls for the sexual liberation of women. She argues that women should have the same rights and sexual freedom as men. Pastor Manders, on the other hand, represents the strict control and repression of sexuality that characterizes the Victorian era.
The religious and spiritual values of Victorian society are also challenged in 'Ghosts.' The play portrays a society that is still heavily influenced by the religious beliefs of Christianity. However, the characters in the play encounter an existential crisis when their belief system is challenged. Pastor Manders, who is the advocate of religion and spirituality in the play, is criticized for his blind faith that does not allow the exploration of science, reason, and logic. Mrs. Alving, on the other hand, is concerned with the potential dangers of religious dogmatism for her son, Oswald, and rejects religion and faith, believing that it has only caused harm to her family in the past. She advocates for the pursuit of knowledge and truth.
The theme of morality is another significant modernist element present in 'Ghosts.' The play challenges the Victorian strict adherence to traditional moral values, mainly defined by religious standards. The characters are portrayed in moral ambiguity and often have to make difficult choices. For example, Mrs. Alving struggles with the guilt of not intervening in her husband's excesses and the challenge of protecting her son from the diseases resulting from her husband's promiscuity. Meanwhile, Pastor Manders faces moral dilemmas of holding onto his religious beliefs and dealing with his secret desires for Mrs. Alving.
In the play, the characters challenge the traditional roles of men and women in the Victorian era. Women are portrayed as independent, strong-willed, and intelligent. Men, on the other hand, are shown as weak, indecisive, and hypocritical. This reversal of gender roles challenges the Victorian perception of masculinity and femininity.
In conclusion, Henrik Ibsen's play 'Ghosts' is a masterpiece of modernist literature. It challenges the Victorian values and beliefs by portraying characters who defy societal norms, gender roles, religious dogma, and moral standards. The modernist elements in the play are essential to its theme, and they challenge the conventional beliefs of the Victorian era. Mrs. Alving and Pastor Manders are the primary characters that bring out these modernist elements in the play. Mrs. Alving challenges the traditional roles of women, whereas Pastor Manders represents the conservative religious and societal values prevalent in the Victorian era. Overall, 'Ghosts' serves as a critique and a call to action against repressive Victorian values, advocating for the liberation of the individual's mind and spirit.
