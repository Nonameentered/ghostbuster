History of the Midland Metro Light Rail System
The idea of the Midland Metro light rail system was conceived in the 1980s as a solution to the increasing traffic congestion in the West Midlands region.

In 1988, the government gave the go-ahead for the construction of the system.
The construction of the Midland Metro light rail system began in 1992, and the first phase was completed in 1999. The first line ran from Birmingham Snow Hill to Wolverhampton St. Georges and covered a distance of 13.5 miles.
Since its inception, the system has undergone several upgrades and expansions. In 2015, a new extension was added, between Birmingham New Street and Birmingham Snow Hill stations. This extension was later further extended to Centenary Square in 2019. Plans are also in place to extend the line from Wolverhampton to Merry Hill via Dudley.
