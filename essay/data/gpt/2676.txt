Seeds are a critical component of agriculture and play a crucial role in the production of food and other plant-based commodities. However, the quality of seeds may deteriorate over time, which can adversely affect their ability to germinate and produce viable plants. Therefore, it is essential to understand the factors that affect seed quality during storage and identify methods for measuring seed viability and vigour. Additionally, it is critical to recognize how the storage environment can affect the deterioration of seed quality and its impact on seed storage practices.
There are several factors that affect seed quality during storage, including seed moisture content, temperature, light, and oxidation. High moisture content in seeds leads to the proliferation of microorganisms, which can cause seed damage and thereby reduce seed vigour and viability. Additionally, high temperature during storage can lead to accelerated deterioration of seeds by affecting the metabolic processes in the seeds. Light exposure also affects seed quality, as it can stimulate the process of seed germination, leading to a decline in seed viability. Lastly, oxidation can influence seed quality as it damages the seed's membrane, affects metabolic rates, and reduces germination ability.
 
Several methods can measure seed viability and vigour, including the tetrazolium test, germination test, and vigor tests. The tetrazolium test is a fast biochemical test that measures the viability of seeds. During the test, seeds are submerged in a solution of tetrazolium and then exposed to light. Healthy, viable seeds show red to purple staining, while dead or damaged seeds incapable of respiration lack staining. On the other hand, the germination test is an essential test that measures the seed's ability to germinate and produce a viable seedling. During the process, seeds are planted, and the percentage of seedlings that emerge is recorded. Seed vigour testing involves assessing the physiological quality of seeds, which may include a range of factors, such as plant emergence, rate of germination, and plant growth. These tests help to determine how viable and vigorous the seeds are and, therefore, how likely they are to produce viable and healthy plants after they are planted.
 
Despite the various methods available for evaluating seed viability and vigour, there are limitations and potential improvements to current methods. For example, the tetrazolium test is a fast, reliable, and cost-effective method for determining seed viability, but it does not provide information on seed vigour. Although the germination test is the most widely used method for assessing seed viability, it can be time-consuming and may not provide accurate results for certain crop species. Additionally, vigor tests, while they can provide valuable information, are often species-specific and time-consuming.
One improvement that has been proposed is the use of molecular markers to determine seed quality. These markers can help detect even small changes in the seed, such as those resulting from environmental stresses during storage. Another potential improvement is the use of high-throughput imaging to analyze seed traits, such as seed size, shape, and fluorescence. Such techniques enable the analysis of large quantities of seeds and can be used to detect early signs of seed deterioration that may not be visible to the naked eye.
The storage environment plays a critical role in the deterioration of seed quality. The ideal storage conditions for seeds include a cool, dry, and dark environment, as this inhibits the growth of microorganisms, slows down seed moisture loss, and limits the effect of oxidative processes. In contrast, high temperature and humidity environments can accelerate seed deterioration, leading to reduced seed viability and overall quality. Additionally, the length of time that seeds are stored can also affect seed quality, as older seeds may be more susceptible to damage from environmental stresses.
The implications of the storage environment for seed storage practices are significant. Seed storage should be carried out under controlled conditions to prevent seed damage and reduce seed loss. This includes storing seeds at an optimal temperature and humidity, which will depend on the specific seed type, as well as the duration and purpose of storage. Additionally, the use of proper packaging materials can help to prevent moisture loss and microbial growth while also protecting seeds from light exposure.
In conclusion, seed quality is a critical factor affecting agricultural production, and understanding the factors that affect seed quality during storage is essential. Seed moisture content, temperature, light, and oxidation all influence seed quality, and various tests are available to evaluate seed viability and vigour. However, these methods have limitations, and there is potential for new techniques to improve their accuracy and sensitivity. Finally, the storage environment is a crucial factor that affects seed quality, and it is necessary to implement sound storage practices to maximize seed quality and yield.
