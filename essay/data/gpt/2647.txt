The common-ion effect is a phenomenon where the presence of an ion that is already present in a solution decreases the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt in that solution. This occurs because of Le Chatelier's principle, which states that when a system is disturbed, it will try to restore equilibrium by shifting the reaction in the opposite direction. In other words, when a solution already contains an ion that is in equilibrium with a sparingly soluble salt, the addition of more of that ion will cause the system to shift in the direction of the solid, decreasing the solubility of the salt.
To demonstrate this effect, consider the sparingly soluble salt potassium periodate (KIO4) and its solubility in various solutions. When KIO4 is dissolved in water, it undergoes the following equilibrium:
KIO4(s) ⇌ K+(aq) + IO4-(aq)
This reaction is at equilibrium, meaning that the concentration of K+ and IO4- is constant. If we add potassium iodate (KIO3) to the solution, however, we are adding more K+ ions to the system. According to Le Chatelier's principle, the system will shift towards the solid KIO4 to restore equilibrium. This results in a decrease in the solubility of KIO4 in the solution.
To demonstrate this experimentally, we can dissolve KIO4 in three different solutions: pure water, a solution containing KNO3, and a solution containing KIO3. We can measure the solubility of KIO4 in each solution by adding KIO4 until no more will dissolve and measuring the concentration of IO4- in the solution using a spectrophotometer. The results of this experiment would show that the solubility of KIO4 is highest in pure water, lower in the KNO3 solution, and lowest in the KIO3 solution.
This experiment demonstrates the common-ion effect in action – the presence of the K+ ion in the KNO3 and KIO3 solutions decreased the solubility of KIO4 in those solutions. This effect has important implications in many areas of chemistry, including the precipitation of minerals, the formation of complexes, and the behavior of acids and bases.
In conclusion, the common-ion effect describes the phenomenon where the presence of an ion in a solution decreases the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt. This effect is due to Le Chatelier's principle, which causes the system to shift towards the solid to restore equilibrium. An experiment with KIO4 can be used to demonstrate this effect, showing that the solubility of KIO4 is dependent on the presence of other ions in the solution. Overall, the common-ion effect is an important factor to consider in many chemical systems.
