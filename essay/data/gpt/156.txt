Mancur Olson’s theory of the correlation between democracy and economic growth highlights the importance of incentivizing collective action to ensure long-term economic benefits. While the theory has been applied to many modern states, it can also be used to understand the historical and economic experiences of China under Qing rule and Western Europe since the late Middle Ages. In this essay, I will explore how Mancur Olson’s theory applies to these regions and the extent to which it explains their economic experiences.
Mancur Olson is one of the most influential economists of the late 20th century. His book, “The Logic of Collective Action,” published in 1965, is widely recognized as a classic in the field of political economy. Olson argued that individuals are motivated by self-interest and that they would only act in a collective manner if they receive some benefits from doing so. This theory can be applied to the analysis of the growth of democracy and economic growth.
In China, the Qing dynasty ruled from 1644 to 1912. During this time, China was one of the world's most powerful nations and had a vast economy. However, the Qing dynasty faced numerous problems that hindered economic growth. One of these problems was the lack of incentives for collective action. Olson’s theory can be used to explain this phenomenon. During the Qing dynasty, self-interest was the primary motivation for the individual. Farmers, merchants, and officials were more concerned with their own profits and the profits of their families, clans, and groups than with the welfare of the state. This prevented the state from investing in infrastructure, technology, and education. As a result, the Chinese economy stagnated for several centuries.
In Western Europe from the late Middle Ages, democracy emerged as the dominant form of government in many countries. Olson would argue that democracy emerged because it incentivized collective action. Specifically, democracies provided a collective voice for the people, which encouraged the state to invest in public goods such as infrastructure, education, and technology. This collective voice was necessary because the state became less interested in the welfare of the people as the economy grew and became more complex. Therefore, the people had to demand services from the state.
Furthermore, democracy incentivizes innovation and economic growth. Introducing free markets, lower tariffs, and reduced regulation encourage innovation and competitiveness. Democracy also provides political stability and establishes property rights which make it easier for entrepreneurs to start businesses.
Ancient societies were often rife with corruption and crony capitalism. The state was the primary source of power and wealth, and the people had little say in how public resources were managed. In such societies, Olson argued that it was difficult to incentivize collective action because there was no clear way to hold those in power accountable. This lack of accountability led to widespread corruption and crony capitalism. In contrast, in modern democratic societies, accountability is a key tenant of governance, and the people have a say in how public resources are managed. This makes it easier to incentivize collective action.
However, the correlation between democracy and economic growth is not always clear. For example, Singapore, a non-democratic country, has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world. Singapore's economy was institutionalized in a way that incentivizes long-term planning and innovation. Private entrepreneurs were given significant tax incentives and other forms of support to develop new ideas and businesses. The government also invested heavily in infrastructure and education to support economic development. In this case, institutional arrangements such as smart economic policies and the rule of law, played a vital role in incentivizing collective action and encouraging economic growth.
During the Qing dynasty, the factors preventing economic growth went beyond the lack of incentives for collective action. Although the Qing dynasty began to implement reforms in the late 19th-century, such as introducing railways and steam-powered ships to improve transportation, these reforms stalled with the downfall of the dynasty and the emergence of the Republic of China. As a result, China's modernization was delayed for several decades.
In Europe, the emergence of democracy and capitalism allowed for innovative technologies to be invented and commercialized. Many important inventions, such as the steam engine, were developed in the late Middle Ages. The rise of the merchant class and the establishment of free markets provided a means for entrepreneurs to invest in these innovations and create new markets. Education was also necessary for these inventions to succeed. Therefore, democratic institutions in Western Europe were necessary for the economy to flourish.
In conclusion, Mancur Olson's theory of the correlation between democracy and economic growth can be used to explain the economic experiences of China under Qing rule and Western Europe since the late Middle Ages to a certain extent. Democracy incentivizes collective action which, in turn, encourages investment in public goods like infrastructure, technology, and education. However, the different institutional arrangements in different societies can play a significant role in incentivizing collective action and encouraging economic growth, as seen in the case of Singapore. While it might not offer all the answers, Olson’s theory is a useful framework for understanding how states can incentivize collective action and drive long-term economic growth.
