Time is a crucial element in both drama and the novel, yet its use differs significantly. In drama, the action takes place in a more condensed timeframe, with events occurring in a single setting that is played out in real-time. In contrast, the novel has the freedom to explore events over a more extended period, across multiple settings and perspectives. This essay will examine the use of time in two prominent literary works, The Winter's Tale and Emma, comparing their approaches to time and how these differences shape character development and the reader's experience.
The Winter's Tale, a play by William Shakespeare, is a story that spans over sixteen years, yet the action takes place within a few hours of stage time, making it a condensed play. This approach to time adds to the readers' experience as they are transported into a world that is different from their everyday reality. Dramas provide a heightened representation of events that are magnified through the live performance of characters that enhances the audience's emotions. In The Winter's Tale, the audience is transported to a world of magic, love, and betrayal, and the compressed events keep them on the edge of their seats. The condensed time frames ensure that the audience's attention is wholly focused on the events unfolding on stage, and this creates a more visceral and emotional connection with the characters.
One way in which the use of time affects character development in drama is through the presentation of the characters' inner thoughts and feelings. Because drama is a performance art, the interplay between characters has to be fleshed out through dialogue, and this means internal dialogues are often glossed over. However, this limitation provides space for the audience to make inferences about the character's intentions and feelings. For example, in The Winter's Tale, Leontes's shifts from a loving husband to a jealous tyrant. Shakespeare does not give the audience any direct insight into Leontes' changing mental state. Still, through his interactions with other characters, his actions become the primary guide to the audience's understanding of his character. In a sense, it is the compression of events and time that forces the audience to pay attention to the dialogue and action unfolding on stage to make inferences about the characters' inner states.
While drama relies on dialogue and actions to convey the characters' inner thoughts, the novel's use of time is more expansive and provides more significant insight into the character's backstory and motives. Jane Austen's Emma, a novel of manners, uses time to explore the development of her titular character and those around her, and offers a rich and complex psychological exploration of the main character Emma. The novel spans over a year and a half, and this extended time frame allows the author to delve deeper into the characters' inner lives and gives the reader a more nuanced understanding of their motivations and inner workings.
Dramas and novel portray time in different methods, but in both genres, time can be used to enhance character development. In Emma, for instance, Austen uses time to show the development of Emma as she learns to navigate the intricate social rules and expectations around her. In the beginning, she is portrayed as vain and self-assured, but as the novel progresses, her experiences teach her to become more empathetic and understanding of those around her. The reader gets to see Emma's thoughts and feelings through her internal dialogues, which the novel form affords, and the extended time frame allows the reader to experience Emma's transformation.
Moreover, the novel allows for the exploration of characters beyond the main characters, which helps to add depth and nuance to the story. In Emma, the author uses omniscient narration to move between perspectives, which adds another dimension to the storytelling as the reader gets a view of the world from different characters' points of view. The use of time in the novel allows the author to interweave the different character's stories, giving the reader a broader perspective on the characters' personalities and motives. The approach to time in Emma is more expansive than the Winter's Tale as the reader is allowed to see the characters' inner struggles and transformations at a more gradual pace.
In drama, time is portrayed through visual methods, which add to the audience's experience by immersing them in the action unfolding on stage. For instance, in The Winter's Tale, Shakespeare uses visual methods such as stagecraft and costumes to establish the different times and locations of the play. The play begins in the court of King Leontes in Sicily, and when the scene shifts to Bohemia, the stagecraft and the costumes are used to create a different feel and atmosphere while marking the change in time and location.
The use of visual methods in drama affects character development as it contributes to creating a more immersive experience for the audience. For instance, the visual cues of mistrust and jealousy displayed by Leontes are conveyed through body language and expressions that can be picked up on by the audience. These visual cues add depth to Leontes' character by revealing more about his personality and intentions beyond what can be gleaned from the dialogue. The use of visual methods in drama, such as costumes, set designs, and props, can enhance the audience's experience by creating a more immersive and visceral connection with the characters.
In conclusion, both drama and the novel use time to shape the reader's experience and affect the development of the characters. The Winter's Tale condenses its story into a few hours of stage time creating a more immersive and visceral experience for the audience. In contrast, Emma explores its characters over a more extensive period, highlighting character development and providing more nuanced insights into their inner worlds. The use of time in drama is conveyed through visual methods such as stagecraft and costumes that emphasize the emotions and intentions of the characters. Still, in the novel, the use of time is more expansive, allowing the reader to explore the characters' inner lives and see their transformation over a more extended period. Ultimately, the approach to time in both genres contributes to the reader or viewer's experience, serving as a vital component of storytelling.
