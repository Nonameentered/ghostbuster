Introduction
The study of animal bones found at archaeological sites can provide us with crucial information about the ancient environment, human-animal interactions, subsistence strategies, and the patterns of animal exploitation in the past. This essay will focus on the methods used to assess and categorize animal bones recovered from a British site, and how the results were compared to another assemblage. We will also examine the different types of information that can be gleaned from the analysis of animal bones, including age, type of animal, weathering, pathology, and butchery. Finally, we will discuss how the minimum number of individuals and the number of individual specimens were calculated and what these results reveal about the dominant species in the assemblage.
Methods used to assess and categorize animal bones
The first step in analyzing animal bones from an archaeological site is to separate them from other materials such as stones, shells, and organic matter. This process is called sorting, which involves visually separating the bones into different categories based on their size, shape, and anatomical characteristics. The categories of bones can be broad, such as mammals, birds, and fish, or more specific, such as deer, cattle, and pig. Once the bones are sorted, they can be counted and weighed to determine the minimum number of individuals (MNI), which is the smallest number of animals represented in the assemblage.
The next step is to assess the condition of the bones, which can provide insights into the taphonomy of the site, or the processes that affected the bones after the animals died. Bones can be classified based on their degree of weathering, which reflects how long the bones have been exposed to the elements. This can be useful in determining whether the bones were deposited at the same time, or whether they accumulated over a longer period. Bones can also show signs of pathological conditions, such as diseases, injuries, and parasites, which can provide evidence about the health of the animals and the environmental factors that contributed to their wellbeing.
Finally, the bones can be examined for evidence of butchery, which involves the intentional cutting and processing of animal carcasses for consumption. Butchery marks can be identified on bones by looking for cut marks, chop marks, and percussion marks, which indicate the use of different types of cutting tools and techniques. Butchery marks can also show evidence of the body parts that were removed or retained, such as bone marrow or animal hides. By analyzing the butchery patterns of the animals from the site, we can gain insights into the hunting and food procurement strategies of the people who lived in the area.
Comparison of results with another assemblage
One of the most effective ways to interpret the results of animal bone analysis is to compare them with another assemblage, either from the same site or a nearby one. This comparison allows us to identify similarities and differences in animal species, bone preservation, and butchery patterns, which can shed light on the environmental and cultural factors that influenced animal exploitation in the past. For example, if two assemblages have similar MNI values and bone preservation patterns, it may suggest that the animals were hunted and processed in similar ways. Conversely, if one assemblage has a higher percentage of pathologies than the other, it may indicate that the animals were exposed to different environmental stressors or that the people who hunted them utilized different hunting techniques.
Information gleaned from the analysis of animal bones
Age and type of animal
The age and type of animals represented in an assemblage can provide insights into the subsistence strategies of the people who inhabited the site. For example, if the site contains a high proportion of young animals, it may suggest that the people were actively hunting and killing animals for food, rather than capturing or scavenging them. Conversely, if the site contains a high proportion of adult animals, it may suggest that the people were selectively targeting older, more experienced animals, which may have provided more nutritious or valuable resources such as hides, bones, or antlers.
Weathering
The degree of weathering of animal bones can provide information about how quickly the bones were exposed to the elements after the animal died. Bones that are heavily weathered may have been exposed to the environment for a longer period of time, and may have been transported or buried before being recovered by archaeologists. Conversely, bones that are relatively unweathered may have been deposited more recently or may have been protected from the elements by natural or cultural factors, such as soil conditions or burial practices.
Pathology
The presence of pathological conditions on animal bones can provide insights into the health and environment of the animals. Pathological conditions can be caused by a variety of factors, including diseases, nutritional deficiencies, or injuries. By analyzing the types and frequencies of pathological conditions, we can gain insights into the environmental stresses that the animals faced, as well as the factors that may have contributed to their overall health and wellbeing.
Butchery
The patterns of butchery on animal bones can reveal how the animals were hunted and processed for food. Different types of butchery marks can indicate the use of different types of cutting tools and techniques, as well as the body parts that were removed or retained. For example, chop marks on the heads of animals may indicate the removal of antlers or horns, while cut marks around the legs may indicate the removal of meat or leather. By analyzing the butchery patterns of animals, we can gain insights into the hunting and food procurement strategies of the people who lived at the site.
Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) and Number of Individual Specimens (NISP)
The minimum number of individuals is the smallest number of animals represented in the assemblage. It is calculated by identifying the bones that are most complete and not duplicated, and then comparing them to each other to determine how many individuals are represented. The minimum number of individuals is an important measure of animal abundance, which can provide insights into the animal population size and density in the past. The number of individual specimens, on the other hand, is the total number of bones identified in the assemblage, regardless of whether they belong to the same animal or not. This measure is useful in determining how many bones were recovered at the site, and which animal species were most commonly represented in the assemblage.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the analysis of animal bones recovered from archaeological sites can provide us with valuable information about the ancient environment, human-animal interactions, subsistence strategies, and the patterns of animal exploitation in the past. By assessing and categorizing animal bones based on their size, shape, and anatomical characteristics, we can gain insights into the age, type, weathering, pathology, and butchery of the animals. Comparing the results of different assemblages can help us identify similarities and differences in animal species, bone preservation, and butchery patterns, which can shed further light on the environmental and cultural factors that influenced animal exploitation in the past. Finally, calculating the minimum number of individuals and the number of individual specimens can reveal important information about the dominant animal species in the assemblage, which can provide insights into the animal population size and density in the past.
