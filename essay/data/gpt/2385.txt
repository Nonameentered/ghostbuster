The growth and development of the Dwarf French Bean are influenced by various factors, such as soil quality, temperature, moisture, and light intensity. These factors can affect seed germination, leaf and stem growth, flower production, and ultimately, yield. An experiment analyzing the plant's development aims to identify which factors positively or negatively impact its growth, as well as to measure the impact of additional treatments, such as fertilization or pruning, on the plant's growth and yield. By understanding the factors affecting the plant's growth, farmers and gardeners can optimize their cultivation practices to improve yields and minimize losses.
