Carthage, an ancient city-state located in North Africa, was a dominant power during the Mediterranean world of the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE. Its success was short-lived due to its rivalry with Rome, which led to the First and Second Punic Wars. These wars were pivotal moments in Roman and Carthaginian history and were characterized by significant political and economic struggles. This essay will examine Carthage's aims during these wars and how different factors such as political situation, resources, and leadership influenced these aims.
Carthage, with its vast resources and navy, aimed to maintain its control of the Western Mediterranean and expand its empire during the First Punic War. The war was triggered due to both powers' ambition to control Sicily, which had become a significant commercial center. Carthage was initially successful, as they had established colonies in the Western Mediterranean, giving them a strong foothold in the region. However, their success was short-lived as Rome's strategic location and resources allowed them to win the first naval battle. After their defeat in the first naval battle, Carthage aimed to regroup, strengthen their navy, and launch a counterattack. Despite some initial setbacks, they managed to make gains in Sicily, and their leader, Hamilcar Barca, was instrumental in securing and fortifying their positions in the region.
The war took a significant toll on both sides, with several peaks and troughs. Despite Carthage's initial intentions, they found themselves troubled by financial constraints, military recruitment issues, and unsteady leadership. In contrast, Rome had a stable government, political institutions, and a strong sense of patriotism, which helped them maintain their resolve in the face of adversity. This contrast highlights the impact of political and military leadership on the aims of the two powers.
The Second Punic War was marked by significant Carthaginian changes in strategy, aims, and leadership. Following their defeat in the First Punic War, Carthage had lost its empire, sources of income, and the political capital that followed such conquests. Their aims shifted to a defensive stance, focusing on preserving their remaining empire and limiting Rome's expansion into their territory. However, this position changed after Hamilcar Barca's death, as his son, Hannibal, rose to power. 
Hannibal was known for his strategic genius and military prowess, and he aimed to defeat Rome and avenge his father's death. He devised an ambitious plan to march his army from Spain into Italy, crossing the Alps with his elephants. This campaign was a significant success, as Hannibal won several victories against Roman armies in Italy, such as the Battle of Cannae, which was one of the worst defeats Rome ever suffered. These victories helped Carthage establish its dominance once again, and Hannibal pushed deep into Italy. 
However, the situation took a dramatic turn when Rome invaded and conquered Carthaginian territories in Spain, depriving them of their primary source of reinforcements, resources, and income. This hampered Carthage's ability to continue Hannibal's campaign, and he was eventually recalled to North Africa to defend Carthage. In North Africa, Hannibal met his demise in the Battle of Zama, where Rome decisively defeated Carthage.
Throughout the Second Punic War, Carthage's aim shifted from defensive to offensive, with the rise of a new leader with a different strategy. Political conditions and leadership changes had a significant impact on Carthage's aims during the war. Hannibal's successes in Italy and strategic brilliance highlighted the impact of strong leadership on the trajectory of a war. However, Carthage's loss of resources and territory in Spain, which had previously given them a considerable advantage, proved decisive in Rome's eventual victory.
In conclusion, the First and Second Punic Wars were major conflicts that significantly impacted the Mediterranean world. Carthage's aims changed over the course of the two wars, from aggressive expansion to defensive preservation. The political situation, leadership, and availability of resources had a significant impact on their aims throughout the wars. In the end, despite Hannibal's greatest efforts, Carthage lost the Second Punic War and their dominance in the Mediterranean world.
