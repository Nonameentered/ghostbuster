"Translate the following pseudo-code into a 'C' program, test it with input values of your choice, and identify any potential issues with the implementation."
To begin, it is important to understand the basics of pseudo-code, which is essentially a plain language description of code. Once the pseudo-code is understood, it can be translated into 'C' programming language. After writing the code, input values can be used to test its functionality. This will help highlight any potential issues or errors that may have occurred during the translation process. Finally, these issues can be addressed and corrected to ensure the program runs smoothly. Overall, translating pseudo-code into a 'C' program and testing it with specific inputs is an effective way to identify and fix any potential issues with the code.
