Health inequalities have been a persistent issue in society for many years. Although there have been advances in medicine and medical technology, this issue persists, and there are complex psychosocial and material circumstances contributing to it. Health inequality is defined as the differences in health status or the unequal distribution of health resources among different population groups. Health inequalities occur as a result of various factors such as social, economic, environmental and political factors.
The complex psychosocial circumstances that contribute to health inequalities are numerous, ranging from education, income and social status. Education is critical to the development of individuals, and it influences health outcomes. Those who have access to good education tend to have better jobs and better health outcomes as they have better knowledge of healthy living and better access to health information. Conversely, those with limited access to education may have poor health outcomes and may be at a higher risk of contracting diseases.
Income is another critical factor that contributes to health inequalities. Low-income earners are more likely to have poor health outcomes due to a lack of access to good nutrition and health care services. They are also more prone to stress-related diseases due to the financial burden of life's daily challenges. This stress can lead to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, in turn leading to physical health problems such as high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Social status also plays a significant role in health inequalities as individuals from socially disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to experience poor health outcomes than those from affluent backgrounds. Those from disadvantaged backgrounds are often exposed to dangerous work environments, low-income living conditions, and limited access to nutritious food and health care services.
Material circumstances also contribute to health inequalities. Poor living conditions such as inadequate housing, overcrowding, and exposure to environmental toxins can increase the risk of poor health outcomes. It is not uncommon to find families living in overcrowded conditions with poor sanitation and hygiene, leading to the spread of disease. Environmental toxins like pollution can lead to respiratory illnesses such as asthma and other respiratory conditions. Additionally, environmental factors such as poor urban planning can lead to limited access to fresh food and physical activity recognition opportunities, which can have dire consequences to an individual’s health.
The social determinants of health, of which the above listed are just a few, are the multifaceted social and economic factors that contribute to health inequalities. Addressing these factors requires a robust approach that involves both national and local policies. National policies that promote education, fairer and equal distribution of wealth, and job creation may contribute to impacting health inequalities positively. Access to quality housing and sanitation facilities and public transportation are also essential policies that require attention to address health inequalities. The implementation of universal health care coverage can be an excellent starting point to fighting health inequalities.
In addition, policies formulated at the local level provide the most significant impact as they are specific to the local community’s needs and circumstances. Local policies such as the implementation of community health centers that offer free or affordable healthcare services, provision of quality education, and encouraging regenerative agriculture could have a significant impact on health inequalities. Public policies aimed at improving neighborhoods, transportation, and green spaces could assist in addressing the social determinants of health and reducing health inequalities.
Health care professionals also have an essential role to play in reducing health inequalities.  Care must be based on evidence-based care and tailored to meet individual patient needs. Health care professionals must recognize the social and economic factors that contribute to a patient's health status. They should be knowledgeable about the most common health issues faced by their communities, such as low-income, ethnically, and culturally diverse populations. Health care professionals must be able to identify the underlying social determinants of health that affect their patients' health outcomes. By doing so, healthcare professionals can provide appropriate resources and follow-up care that better serve the needs of patients, and can contribute significantly to reducing health inequalities.
In conclusion, health inequalities are a multifaceted issue, with both psychosocial and material circumstances contributing to their persistence. The social determinants of health play a critical role in affecting health outcomes. Policies implemented at both the national and local levels could contribute significantly to addressing health inequalities. Health care professionals should also play their role by recognizing the social determinants of health and providing individualized care that better addresses their patient’s needs. By working together, governments, healthcare professionals, and communities can work towards reducing health inequalities and achieving optimal health outcomes for everyone.
