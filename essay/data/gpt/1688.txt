The narrative voice in Coleridge's "The Growth of Scientific Attitudes in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries" and Austen's Emma functions differently, reflecting the authors' attitudes towards their readers. Coleridge's essay, written in a didactic style, is meant to inform his readers about the historical development of scientific thinking. On the other hand, Austen's novel, using free indirect discourse, allows the reader to experience Emma's world, while simultaneously critiquing her actions.
Coleridge's narrative voice in "The Growth of Scientific Attitudes" is informative and didactic. The essay's purpose is to present a historical account of the development of scientific attitudes and the heroic individuals who contributed to its evolution. The narrator's authoritative tone is meant to inspire readers to learn from the past and continue the progress of scientific inquiry. Coleridge speaks to the reader through a third-person omniscient perspective, allowing him to recount historical events and ideas from a position of authority. He also employs rhetorical devices, such as metaphors, to help readers understand abstract concepts.
In contrast, Austen's use of free indirect discourse allows readers to inhabit the perspectives of the various characters, rather than a detached narrator. This technique emphasizes the characters' subjectivity and allows readers to experience the events of the story as if they were happening in real-time. This is particularly evident in scenes involving Emma and her interactions with those around her. By using this technique, Austen allows the reader to see Emma's flaws and shortcomings, rather than simply telling the reader about them.
The difference in how the narrative voice functions reflects the authors' attitudes towards their readers. Coleridge's essay is meant to instruct and inform readers about scientific inquiry. The authoritative voice of the narrator implies that the author believes that he knows more than the reader and is offering valuable guidance. Austen's use of free indirect discourse, in contrast, treats the reader as a participating member of the story. The age of scientific enlightenment and discovery had passed, and Austen lived in a time where literature was becoming more accessible to a wider audience. She believed that her readers were capable of engaging with complex narratives and recognizing their own experiences in the characters she created.
The difference between Coleridge's and Austen's attitudes towards their readers is further reflected in the formal structures of their respective works. Coleridge's essay is organized logically, following the historical development of scientific attitudes in a linear fashion. It draws on examples to illustrate the ideas presented and offers recommendations for the future. Austen's Emma, however, is structured around the character's actions and experiences. The novel's plot is nonlinear, with events and revelations occurring over time, much like the ebb and flow of real life. Austen believed that her readers would appreciate the complexity of human behavior and the intricate webs of interaction that make up contemporary society.
Moreover, Coleridge's use of formal language reflects his attitude towards his readers. His essay includes complex sentence structures, formal diction, and technical terminology. The language reflects the author's belief that scientific inquiry requires precise language to convey complex ideas. This may have alienated some readers who were not familiar with the terminology used, but it also appealed to those who shared his belief in the importance of scientific inquiry.
Austen's use of language in Emma, by contrast, is informal, conversational, and full of irony and humor. She employs colloquialisms and slang to capture the vernacular of her characters and the world they inhabit. She believed that language was a tool for engaging with readers and expressing the complexities of human emotion and behavior. The novel's humor and irony are used to critique social norms and gender roles in a way that would have resonated with readers at the time.
In conclusion, the narrative voice functions differently in Coleridge's "The Growth of Scientific Attitudes in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries" and Austen's Emma. Coleridge's use of a didactic, authoritative voice conveys his belief in the importance of scientific inquiry and his belief that readers require guidance. Austen's use of free indirect discourse allows readers to experience the world of the novel and critique the actions of the protagonist. The difference in these approaches reflects the authors' attitudes towards their readers and their beliefs in the role of literature in shaping society. By offering different styles of narrative voice, Coleridge and Austen demonstrate the flexibility and expansiveness of the literary form.
