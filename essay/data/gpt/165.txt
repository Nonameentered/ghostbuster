The Conservative party came to power in 1979, with a clear mandate to tackle the economic and social challenges faced by the UK. The main principles that informed Conservative social policy during this period were based on individual freedom, self-reliance, a smaller role for the state, and a focus on economic growth and competitiveness. These principles shaped the government's approach to key issues such as inflation control, property ownership, competition in public services, and government authority, which we will explore in more detail below.
Inflation Control
Inflation was one of the biggest challenges facing the UK in the 1970s, with high levels of price increases eroding the purchasing power of the pound and damaging the economy. The Conservatives believed that inflation was primarily caused by excessive government spending, and that the best way to control it was to reduce the size of the state and limit public spending. The government adopted a monetarist approach to economic policy, which involved using interest rates and money supply to control the economy.
The Conservative government's main tool for controlling inflation was the creation of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee in 1997, which was given operational responsibility for setting interest rates to meet a target for inflation, with the goal of achieving price stability. This independent committee was a key part of the Conservative party's commitment to reducing the role of the state in economic affairs, and it helped to establish the UK's credibility as a low-inflation economy.
Property Ownership
The Conservatives believed that private ownership of property was a key driver of economic growth and personal freedom. They saw home ownership as a key part of the social fabric of the country, and sought to create policies that would encourage people to buy their own homes and invest in property.
One of the most significant policies of the Conservative government during this period was the introduction of the Right to Buy scheme in 1980, which gave council tenants the opportunity to buy their homes at a discount. This policy was designed to encourage home ownership and to promote a property-owning democracy. Thousands of council homes were sold to tenants throughout the 1980s, and the policy is still in place today, albeit with limited availability.
The Conservatives also believed that a thriving private rental sector was essential for a healthy housing market. They introduced policies to encourage private investment in the rental sector, including tax incentives for landlords and the creation of a national forward market for residential property.
Competition in Public Services
The Conservatives believed that competition was vital for improving public services and driving up standards. They saw the state monopoly on public services as an obstacle to progress, and believed that competition would create a more efficient and responsive system.
The government introduced policies to encourage competition in a range of public services, including healthcare, education, and transport. In education, the introduction of grant-maintained schools in 1988 allowed schools to opt out of local authority control and to receive funding directly from central government. This created a more competitive environment for schools, and encouraged greater innovation and efficiency.
The Conservatives also introduced policies to encourage private sector provision of public services. The Private Finance Initiative (PFI), introduced in 1992, allowed private companies to invest in public infrastructure projects, such as hospitals, in return for a share of the profits. This encouraged greater innovation and investment in public services, and helped to reduce the burden on the public purse.
Government Authority
The Conservatives believed that the state should have a smaller role in people's lives, and that government should focus on creating the conditions for economic growth and personal freedom. They saw the traditional role of the state as an obstacle to progress, and sought to reduce the power of government in people's lives.
One of the key policies of the Conservative government during this period was privatisation. They believed that the state-owned enterprises were often inefficient and unresponsive to market pressures, and that privatisation would encourage greater innovation and efficiency. The sale of state-owned enterprises such as British Telecom, British Gas, and British Airways helped to create a more competitive business environment and improve services for consumers.
The Conservatives also believed that the criminal justice system needed reform. They introduced measures to reduce the power of trade unions, including legislation to limit their ability to take strike action. They also introduced tough measures to tackle crime, including mandatory minimum sentences for certain offences and the creation of new offences such as criminal damage.
Conclusion
The main principles that informed Conservative social policy from 1979 to 1997 were based on individual freedom, self-reliance, a smaller role for the state, and a focus on economic growth and competitiveness. These principles shaped the government's approach to key issues such as inflation control, property ownership, competition in public services, and government authority.
The Conservative government adopted a monetarist approach to economic policy, creating the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee to control inflation. They also introduced policies to encourage home ownership and private investment in the rental sector, and encouraged competition in public services through the introduction of grant-maintained schools and the PFI. Finally, the government sought to reduce the power of government in people's lives, with measures such as privatisation and tough measures to tackle crime.
Overall, the Conservative government of this period played a significant role in shaping the political and economic landscape of the UK, introducing policies that continue to influence public policy today. While not all of the policies introduced during this period have been without controversy, they provide an important lesson in the principles that can drive government policymaking and the impact they can have on society.
