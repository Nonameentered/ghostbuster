The Ampère's law, together with the Biot-Savart law, can be used to calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field around a wire. The Ampère's law, also known as the Ampère's circuital law, involves integrating the magnetic field around a closed loop in order to determine the magnitude of the magnetic field. The Biot-Savart law, on the other hand, is used to determine the magnetic field at a particular point due to a current-carrying wire.
To calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field around a wire using the Ampère's law, the first step is to select a closed loop around the wire. This allows us to determine the total magnetic field within the loop. Next, we need to determine the direction of the magnetic field at each point on the loop. This can be done using the right-hand rule, where we point our thumb in the direction of the current and our fingers curl in the direction of the magnetic field.
Once the direction of the magnetic field at each point on the loop has been determined, we can use Ampère's law to calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field. The equation for Ampère's law states that the integral of the magnetic field around a closed loop is equal to the product of the current passing through the loop and the permeability of free space.
The Biot-Savart law, on the other hand, is used to determine the magnetic field at a particular point due to a current-carrying wire. The equation for the Biot-Savart law states that the magnetic field at a particular point due to a current-carrying wire is proportional to the current, the length of the wire, and the sine of the angle between the wire and the line connecting the point to the wire.
In conclusion, the process for calculating the magnitude of the magnetic field around a wire using the Ampère's law and the Biot-Savart law involves selecting a closed loop around the wire, determining the direction of the magnetic field at each point on the loop, and using the appropriate equation to calculate the magnitude of the magnetic field.
