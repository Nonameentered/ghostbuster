Sloman's Model of Human Reasoning and Its Explanation for the Variability of Results in Psychological Experiments Investigating Reasoning
The study of human reasoning has been a topic of interest in psychology for decades. Various theories and models have been proposed to explain how people reason and evidence from experiments examining people's decision-making processes. One of these models is Sloman's model of human reasoning, which provides an account of how people reason about different domains and the variability of results obtained from psychological experiments investigating reasoning. This essay will discuss Sloman's model of human reasoning, its explanation of the variety of results found in psychological experiments examining reasoning and provide examples of psychological experiments that support this theory.
Sloman's model of human reasoning is based on the idea that there are different kinds of reasoning, each being specific to different domains. According to Sloman, people use domain-specific reasoning systems to reason in different contexts. Sloman suggests that a specific set of reasoning systems is used to solve problems in each domain, which results in better performance in that domain. For example, when people reason about social situations, they use social reasoning, and when they reason about logical problems, they use logical reasoning.
Furthermore, Sloman's model suggests that there are different modes of reasoning, one being automatic and the other controlled. Automatic reasoning occurs when people solve problems quickly and intuitively without much effort. Automatic thinking relies on heuristics, which are shortcuts or rules of thumb used to make judgments. On the other hand, controlled reasoning is slow, deliberate and more effortful. Controlled thinking requires more cognitive resources and relies on logical rules to make judgments. Sloman's model suggests that people reason in different modes based on the context, the task and the individual's goals.
Sloman's model of human reasoning provides an excellent understanding of the variability of results found in psychological experiments investigating reasoning. The model suggests that the factors that influence human reasoning depend on the domains, the modes of reasoning, and individual differences. Consequently, the interpretation of experimental results must consider these factors.
A psychological experiment that supports Sloman's model of human reasoning is the Wason selection task. This task assesses people's ability to reason logically and appeals to people's intuition. Participants are presented with four cards, each with a letter on one side and a number on the other side. They are tasked to select which cards they need to turn over to determine whether the following statement is true or false:
"If you took a vowel, then the number on the other side is even."
The correct answer is to turn over the cards with 'A' and '7' to determine whether the statement is true or false. The general finding of this experiment is that people perform poorly on this task. Sloman's model suggests that the variability of performance on the Wason selection task is because of the domain of reasoning. The task requires logical reasoning, which is a controlled mode of reasoning and demands more cognitive resources. Therefore, people who are better at logical reasoning perform better on this task.
Another experiment that supports Sloman's model of human reasoning is the Monty Hall Dilemma. The Monty Hall Dilemma is a puzzle in which a participant is asked to select one of three doors, one of which has a prize behind it, and the other two being losing doors. Once a door has been chosen, one of the other two doors is opened, revealing a losing door. The participant is then given the option of switching their original choice to the other unopened door before the final reveal. The correct answer to this problem is to switch, which has shocked many people as it goes against their intuition. The research suggests that people are more likely to choose incorrectly if they are presented with a choice between two doors rather than three. This experiment supports Sloman's model as the variability of performance can be explained by the mode of thinking. The problem requires automatic thinking, which relies on intuition and requires minimal effort. When presented with a choice between two doors, people perceive that they have a 50/50 chance of winning, and changing their answer does not increase their chance of winning.
In conclusion, Sloman's model of human reasoning provides an excellent explanation of the variability of results found in psychological experiments investigating reasoning. The model suggests that there are different domains and modes of reasoning, which are influenced by the task, context and individual differences. The Wason selection task and the Monty Hall Dilemma are experimental examples supporting Sloman's model. The variability in performance can be explained based on the domain of reasoning, the mode of thinking and individual differences. Consequently, future researchers should consider these factors while designing experiments and interpreting results to better understand human reasoning processes.
