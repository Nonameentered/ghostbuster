Peru, just like many other Latin American nations, faced challenges in the integration of its indigenous population. The 19th century marked a significant time of transformation and modernization in the region. Peru's colonization and conquest by the Spanish established ethnic and social hierarchies that persisted for centuries. The indigenous population was viewed as inferior and marginalized, and their integration into Peruvian society was a pressing issue of national importance. This essay will examine the challenges faced by Peru in integrating its indigenous population during the 19th century and how the government's approach to the "Indian Problem" contributed to the country's social and political makeup.
The indigenous population made up a significant part of Peru's population in the 19th century. However, they were perceived as outsiders, and their cultural and linguistic traditions were often disregarded or suppressed. Before gaining independence from Spain, indigenous people were subjected to unfair labor and taxation policies that left them living in abject poverty. After independence, the government inherited the same discriminatory policies, and the indigenous population was left without socio-economic mobility.
One of the significant challenges faced by Peru during the 19th century was the persistence of the caste system. This hierarchy was based on race, with criollos (Peruvians of Spanish descent) at the top and indigenous peoples at the bottom. The caste system ensured that criollos were favored in education, employment, and social statuses, making it hard for indigenous people to move upward. Education, for example, was a preserve of the elites who shielded it from the lower classes, denying them the opportunity to enhance their intellectual capacity and promote their upward mobility. The social hierarchy contributed to the marginalization of the indigenous population, reducing their chances of becoming a part of the Peruvian society.
Another significant challenge faced by Peru was the lack of political representation of the indigenous population. Since the indigenous people could not participate in the electoral process, they were voiceless in political matters. As a result, the government made decisions without considering the needs and interests of the indigenous population. During this period, the government ignored the plight of the indigenous people, which further led to their isolation and disillusionment with the government.
The government's approach to the “Indian Problem” was to try to assimilate the indigenous population into mainstream Peruvian society forcefully. The government regarded the indigenous people as an obstacle to progress and development and believed that they needed to be brought into the mainstream society to facilitate economic and social growth. A cultural assimilation program was initiated, which encouraged indigenous people to adopt Spanish culture and way of life. Indigenous people were forced to give up their traditional ways of life, such as agriculture and handicrafts, in favor of wage labor, fuelling the economic growth of the country.
The government's assimilation policies resulted in the destruction of indigenous culture. The authorities forbade indigenous traditions such as religious practices and festivals, preventing the indigenous people from collectively expressing themselves. They were discouraged from speaking their languages and adopting Spanish attire and customs. Consequently, the forced assimilation policies changed the country's social and cultural makeup and threatened to erode the indigenous people's uniqueness and identity.
The government's approach to the "Indian Problem" had lasting implications for the indigenous population's social and political makeup. Indigenous people have faced systemic discrimination, exclusion, and poverty for most of the country's history, even after the elimination of the caste system. Political representation has remained elusive for the indigenous population, and their needs and interests are often disregarded.
Moreover, the forced assimilation policies promoted a perception of Spanish cultural superiority. The indigenous population became seen as backward, undesirable, and subservient to the new, white, Spanish-speaking elite. Additionally, the indigenous people were relocated to small enclaves, where their movement and contact with mainstream Peruvian society were limited, thereby reducing their opportunities for economic, social, and political advancement.
In conclusion, Peru faced significant challenges in integrating its indigenous population, and the government's approach to the "Indian Problem" contributed to the social and political makeup of the country. The caste system, lack of political representation, and forced assimilation policies contributed to the indigenous population's disenfranchisement and marginalization in the Peruvian society. Indigenous people became voiceless, and their traditions and cultures were suppressed, leading to the erosion of their ethnic identity. Therefore, the Peruvian government should create policies that uphold the indigenous population's dignity, protect their culture and traditions, and enable their socio-economic mobility. Only through these measures can Peru integrate its indigenous population into the nation effectively.
