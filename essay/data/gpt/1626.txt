Dirt and pollution are two concepts that shape and define societal norms and classifications in various ways. While dirt and pollution may refer to physical debris that accumulates around us, they can also refer to immaterial perceptions that define human relationships. In this sense, the concepts of dirt and pollution manifest in various ways, including social, cultural, environmental, economic, and political dimensions. In this essay, we shall discuss the ways in which dirt and pollution shape societal norms and classifications, and how these divisions among people affect perspectives of acceptable and discordant behaviors.
The concept of dirt and pollution is ingrained in the construction of societal norms and classifications. It can be observed in different areas such as class, race, and gender relations. On a social level, dirt and pollution have been used to define human relationships by categorizing people based on their cleanliness, income, education, and social status. For example, the concept of dirt is implicitly related to poverty across various cultures. People living in slums or facing homelessness are discriminated against, and their lack of resources may lead them to be perceived as ‘unclean.’ In turn, this ‘uncleanliness’ may lead to them being excluded from certain communities or institutions. On the other hand, people with significant wealth and privilege have better access to resources that can help them maintain cleaner spaces. 
Furthermore, dirt and pollution can shape societal norms based on race and ethnicity. For example, in the United States, the concept of race played a significant role in shaping the way some groups were forced to live in poor and polluted environments. In the process of American industrialization, certain communities were forcibly relocated to specific geographical locations, such as Indigenous communities that were forced onto reservations or African Americans who were pushed into urban centers. The deliberate pollution of these areas has led to environmental racism, which refers to the disproportionate exposure of marginalized communities to environmental hazards. In this sense, the concept of dirt and pollution contributes to how race and ethnicity can impact access to clean and safe environments.
Moreover, dirt and pollution can define and shape gender roles. In many cultures, women are expected to maintain a high level of cleanliness in their homes while men are treated with leniency. This gendered division of labor may lead to the notion of women being ‘cleaner’ than men. On the other hand, men are expected to work outside, expose themselves to dirt and grime, and are occasionally exempted from domestic cleaning duties. This gendered division of labor perpetuates the notion that certain genders can handle dirt and pollution better than others.
In addition, societal norms and classifications are affected by economic dimensions such as class and income. In capitalist societies, economic success is often equated with cleanliness, and as such, deems poverty as unclean. This concept leads to a greater divide between the poor and wealthy. Individuals from poor backgrounds are often made to feel ashamed of their perceived uncleanliness, which perpetuates the notion that one’s worth is based on their income and social status. Societal norms and classifications are, therefore, shaped by economic dimensions, creating a hierarchy between the rich and poor.
Furthermore, environmental pollution affects societal norms on a global scale. Environmental pollution has become a major source of concern affecting life on earth due to the destruction of the natural environment. Polluted environments such as oceans, forests, and rivers have led to a decline in biodiversity and an increase in natural disasters. Societal norms are, therefore, shaped by environmental concerns by highlighting the importance of taking care of the planet and acknowledging the consequences of neglecting the environment.
The divisions created by societal norms and classifications dictated by dirt and pollution affect perspectives of acceptable and discordant behaviors in different ways. For instance, the perception of the wealthy as ‘cleaner’ than the poor negatively affects how the poor are perceived and treated. This treatment demeans individuals from lower-income communities and fosters the idea that success is tied to cleanliness, reinforcing the importance of class and wealth in society.
Furthermore, the perception of women as being ‘cleaner’ than men has influenced their role in society, affecting their rights, and perpetuating traditional gender roles. This perception contributes to the construction of gender expectations in different communities where women are expected to perform certain duties and tasks while men are expected to perform others.
Additionally, the global concern of environmental pollution has led to collective efforts in mitigating its impact on the environment. This effort has seen different countries and communities adopting environmentally friendly behavior in an effort to protect the planet. However, the division created by societal norms often clashes with collective efforts aimed at conserving the environment. The prioritization of wealth and social status often prevents individuals from seeing the importance of environmental conservation, leading to further damage to the planet.
On a broader level, the divisions created by societal norms and classifications can hinder progress and lead to discordant behaviors. For example, environmental racism leads to the disproportionate exposure of marginalized communities to environmental hazards, affecting lives and causing discordant behavior between different classes and races. Similarly, the displacement of communities based on race and ethnicity can cause conflict and lead to discordant behavior. In this sense, societal norms and classifications shaped by dirt and pollution have the potential to foster behaviors that are unfavorable to society.
In conclusion, dirt and pollution shape and define societal norms and classifications in various ways, including social, cultural, economic, and environmental dimensions. These divisions based on dirt and pollution affect perspectives of acceptable and discordant behavior in society. However, the way these norms and classifications shape human relationships should be re-considered. Efforts should be made to achieve a more equitable society that respects the dignity and worth of all individuals regardless of their class, race, gender, or income. By creating a fair society that does not separate individuals based on their perceived ‘cleanliness,’ society can create a more cohesive and peaceful community.
