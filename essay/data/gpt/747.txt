Management is a field that deals with the administration and coordination of various resources, including human resources, financial resources, and physical resources. It is a multifaceted discipline that requires a practical and theoretical understanding of diverse fields such as economics, psychology, communication, and sociology. Management as a field has developed in various ways, with different approaches evolving throughout its history. Among these approaches are natural science, social science, behavioral science, and positivism. The nature of management being a social science, its study requires a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates diverse skills and knowledge from different fields. In this essay, I will explore the limitations of natural scientific methods in capturing the psychological and social aspects of management and discuss the applicability of the positivist view in the study of this field.
The study of management as a natural science aims to explain and predict human behavior and interactions in organizations and how they are affected by external factors such as the economy, political systems, and culture. Natural science methods are focused on empirical data, which is gathered through experiments and observation. Data is analyzed and interpreted through mathematical models and statistical analysis. In management, natural science methods are used to explore and analyze quantitative data on issues such as productivity, efficiency, and profitability. However, this approach has some significant limitations when it comes to capturing the psychological and social aspects of management.
Firstly, natural scientific methods overlook the complexities of human behavior and interactions in organizations. The natural scientific approach assumes that human behavior is predictable and can be explained by natural laws and principles. This view is based on the positivist view of the natural world, which seeks to explain phenomena through objective observation and analysis. However, human behavior is subject to various influences, including cultural, social, and historical factors, which make it difficult to predict and explain through natural laws and principles.
Secondly, natural scientific methods are limited in their ability to capture the subjective experiences of human behavior and interactions. In management, subjective experiences such as job satisfaction, motivation, and work-life balance are essential factors in understanding human behavior in organizations. These experiences are subjective and vary from one individual to another, making it challenging to capture them using natural scientific methods. The subjective nature of human behavior and interactions means that social scientists need to adopt multiple methods that incorporate qualitative data to capture these subjective experiences.
Thirdly, natural scientific methods are limited in their ability to capture the fluid and dynamic nature of human behavior and interactions in organizations. Natural scientific methods assume that behavior is static and can be controlled by external factors such as incentives and punishments. However, human behavior is dynamic and constantly changing, making it difficult to predict and control using static methods. Social scientists need to adopt dynamic approaches that capture changes over time, such as longitudinal studies, to capture the dynamic nature of behavior and interactions in organizations.
The positivist view of the natural world, which forms the basis of natural scientific methods, has been criticized as being too deterministic and reductionist. Positivists argue that the study of management should focus on gathering objective data through scientific methods such as observation and experimentation. The method of natural science includes four steps: description, prediction, control, and explanation. The first step is description where researchers gather data on a phenomenon by observing and measuring it. The second step is prediction where researchers use the data gathered from the first stage to predict future outcomes or behaviors. The third step is control where researchers use the data generated in the first and second stages to develop strategies for controlling or manipulating the phenomenon. The final stage is explanation where researchers use the data generated in the previous stages to develop a theory explaining the phenomenon.
However, this approach has been criticized by interpretivists, who argue that reality is socially constructed and patterns of human behavior are inferred. Interpretivists reject the notion that there are objective laws that can explain human behavior and instead focus on how individuals give meaning to their experiences. Interpretivists use qualitative data such as interviews and focus groups to capture subjective experiences and explore how individuals construct their reality.
The use of organizational interventions and training by social scientists is aimed at controlling human behavior in organizations. Organizational interventions are designed to change organizational practices and procedures while training is aimed at developing new skills and knowledge in individuals. Organizational interventions and training are based on the assumption that behavior is static, and individuals can be easily trained to behave in a particular way. However, this assumption overlooks the dynamic and fluid nature of human behavior and interactions in organizations.
The limitations of determinate predictions used in the study of natural sciences are also relevant in the context of management. Predictive models are used in management to forecast outcomes based on historical data. However, predictive models are limited in their ability to capture the emergent nature of behavior. Emergent behavior is behavior that arises spontaneously and cannot be predicted through traditional predictive models. In management, emergent behavior can significantly affect outcomes and is difficult to anticipate.
Finally, the radical functionalist view of management as scientific, positivist, and objective has been challenged by the current socio-psychological perspective of organizational behavior that focuses on intrinsically human behavior. The socio-psychological perspective of organizational behavior is based on the idea that individuals are motivated by intrinsic factors such as a sense of purpose and autonomy. It also recognizes the importance of cultural and social factors in shaping behavior and interactions in organizations. This perspective emphasizes the importance of understanding human behavior and interactions in organizations based on the internal motives and values that drive individuals.
In conclusion, the study of management requires a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates diverse skills and knowledge from different fields. Natural scientific methods have limitations when it comes to capturing the psychological and social aspects of management. Social scientists need to adopt multiple research methods that incorporate qualitative data to capture subjective experiences, dynamic approaches that capture changes over time and explore how individuals construct their reality, and recognize the intrinsic and social factors that drive individuals. Social scientists also need to recognize the limitations of organizational interventions and training and the limitations of predictive models in capturing emergent behavior. The current socio-psychological perspective of organizational behavior provides a more holistic view of human behavior and interactions in organizations. Management as a field should continue to evolve and incorporate different approaches to provide a better understanding of human behavior and interactions in organizations.
