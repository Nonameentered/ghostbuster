In the field of medical sociology, the concept of biographical disruption has emerged as an important theoretical framework for explaining the experiences, and meaning-making processes of people with chronic illnesses. This concept was first introduced by Arthur Frank and David B. Morris in their seminal work on chronic illness, where they described the experience of chronic illness as a biographical disruption, which refers to the profound and life-altering impact that chronic illness has on individuals' lives, relationships, and self-identity (1). The term biographical disruption was further elaborated and popularized by Bury (1982), who posited that chronic illness can be understood as a serious threat to a person's biographical continuity; that is, to their sense of self, their plans, and their future.
This essay aims to explain the concept of biographical disruption as outlined by Bury (1982), and to evaluate its effectiveness in illuminating the realities of meaning and experience of chronic illness. Firstly, this essay will discuss Bury's theoretical framework, which is based on the idea of biographical continuity and its disruption by the onset of chronic illness. Secondly, this essay will explore how this concept has been applied in empirical research and its usefulness in understanding the lived experiences of people with chronic illness. Finally, this essay will critically evaluate the concept of biographical disruption and its effectiveness in helping to develop more effective interventions and support for people with chronic illness.
To begin with, biographical disruption as described by Bury (1982), is a theoretical framework that focuses on the impact of chronic illness on the continuity of individuals' lives. According to Bury, people with chronic illness are confronted with a profound threat to their biographical continuity, which is their sense of self, their identity, and their future aspirations. He argued that chronic illness disrupts the biographical continuity in three ways. Firstly, it disrupts the temporal continuity of an individual's life. People with chronic illness experience a profound sense of unpredictability and uncertainty when it comes to the future. The chronic illness forces a person to live in a state of limbo, constantly waiting for the next episode, and struggling to plan for the future. Secondly, chronic illness disrupts the social continuity of an individual's life. People with chronic illness experience significant changes in their social relationships, and may experience stigma, isolation, and rejection from friends and family members. The chronic illness can also impact an individual's work and employment, leading to a significant impact on their economic stability and status. Finally, the chronic illness disrupts the narrative continuity of an individual's life. People with chronic illness often have to adjust their life plans and goals to account for their illness. They may have to give up certain activities, hobbies, and goals that they had before they become ill. As such, the chronic illness disrupts the stories that individuals tell about themselves and their life plans, leading to a profound sense of loss and disorientation.
Empirical research has demonstrated the usefulness of the biographical disruption concept in helping to understand the lived experiences of people with chronic illness. According to studies in the field of medical sociology, people with chronic illness experience a continuous struggle to maintain a sense of normality, autonomy, and self-control in the face of illness-related constraints. For example, Edwards et al. (2009) conducted a study of people living with Type 2 Diabetes. The study revealed that people with chronic illness experienced a sense of frustration and loss of control over their lives. Participants in the study described how their illness had disrupted their plans, goals, and aspirations, leading to a significant sense of disorientation and uncertainty about the future. The biographical disruption concept was able to capture the complexity of these experiences and provided a useful theoretical framework for understanding how chronic illness can impact identity and self-identity.
Similarly, the biographical disruption concept has been applied in research studies on other chronic illnesses, such as cancer, HIV, and cardiovascular disease. For example, Thorne et al. (2000) conducted a qualitative study of people living with cancer. The study found that people with cancer experienced a sense of immediacy, and that the biographical disruption caused by cancer led to significant changes in their lives, relationships, and self-identity. Participants in the study talked about the profound sense of disorientation and loss caused by cancer and how it impacted their sense of self and future aspirations. Again, the biographical disruption concept was useful in understanding how illness-related disruptions impact identity, self-identity, and long-term planning.
However, while the biographical disruption concept has been critical in illuminating the realities of meaning and experience of chronic illness, there are also potential limitations to its usefulness. Most notably, the concept may be too narrowly focused on individual experiences to the exclusion of social structures and contextual factors that impact people with chronic illness. For example, the impact of social determinants of health may be just as, if not more significant than the effects of illness itself on people with chronic illness. Additionally, while biographical disruption is often pathologized as a negative, it may also provide an opportunity for growth and re-conceptualization of self and future plans after a diagnosis. A more comprehensive approach to the biographical disruption concept should consider the impact of the social context, diversity among chronic illnesses and interventions that may provide additional support and resources to individuals experiencing biographical disruptions.
In conclusion, the concept of biographical disruption, as described by Bury (1982), is an essential framework for understanding the experiences and meaning-making processes of people with chronic illness. Biographical disruption highlights how chronic illness can impact individual's sense of self and continuity, and how it shapes their experiences and life plans. Empirical research has demonstrated the usefulness of the biographical disruption concept in understanding the lived experiences of people with chronic illness. However, while it remains a valuable approach to the experiences of people with chronic illness, the biographical disruption concept should be used contextually and in combination with other structural and contextual frameworks to provide comprehensive support to people experiencing biographical disruption.
