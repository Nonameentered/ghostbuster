Introduction
The human body relies on various nutrients to function correctly. People must get these from their diet to maintain and improve their health. However, there are several reasons why people might not get the essential vitamins and minerals that their bodies need. Food fortification and functional foods are two ways that micro-nutrients can be added to food products to improve nutrition and health all over the world.
Food fortification and the use of functional foods have been successful in addressing micronutrient deficiencies in many countries. Still, some people argue that it is not a long-term solution to societal health problems. This essay considers the effectiveness of food fortification and functional foods and the potential benefits and drawbacks of adding micro-nutrients to widely consumed food products.
Effectiveness of Food Fortification and Functional Foods
Food fortification refers to the process of adding essential micronutrients to food items to improve their nutritional value. An example of this is fortifying milk with vitamin D and calcium to meet the recommended daily intake levels designated by experts. These nutrients are necessary in the body for strong bones and teeth and for maintaining healthy blood levels of calcium and phosphorus.
Adding micronutrients to food products has been vital in addressing micronutrient malnutrition in many countries, primarily deficiency in vitamin A, iron, and iodine. In several regions, the use of iron-fortified wheat flour, breakfast cereals, and other staples added iron to the diets of pregnant women and children, lowering anemia rates and providing essential vitamins for fetal and infant development (Tetens et al). 
Functional foods are those that promote health beyond their nutrient content. They contain additives and macronutrients that have been shown to provide specific health benefits in controlled clinical settings. An example of this is probiotic yogurt, which contains live bacteria that promote healthy gut microbiota and digestion. Functional foods have become more popular due to advancements in food technology and nutritional science.
The combination of these two health food types has improved access to essential vitamins, micronutrients, and bioactive compounds, contributing to the global availability of healthy food choices. They have played a vital role in addressing micronutrient deficiencies worldwide, reducing their incidence and severity. Through food fortification and the creation of functional foods, populations gained more access to nutrients, contributing to healthier populations.
Benefits of Adding Micronutrients to Widely Consumed Food Products
Adding micronutrients to widely consumed food products has several benefits, mainly for populations in developing nations. These benefits include the following.
1. Decreased Risk of Nutrient Deficiency
Fortifying staple food products consumed by large segments of the population, such as maize meal and rice, can increase the intake of approximately needed micronutrients. This results in a decrease in the prevalence of nutrient deficiencies. Folic acid, iron, and other forms of vitamin and mineral fortification have been added to various widely consumed products in several countries, reducing the incidence of deficiency in these populations' nutrient levels.
2. Improved Maternal and Infant Health
Micronutrient deficiencies are a significant concern for pregnant women since they can harm the health of both the mother and child. Certain nutrients, such as iron and iodine, are necessary for healthy maternal and fetal development. Food fortification and the use of functional foods have made significant contributions to improving maternal and fetal health by addressing the deficiencies in these areas.
3. Affordable and Accessible
The addition of micronutrients to widely consumed food products also makes them affordable and accessible for all, regardless of income levels. This has led to the widespread availability of fortified food items in many countries, improving public health outcomes.
4. Adds Variety to Diet
Fortifying foodstuffs with micro-nutrients, especially in cases where people have limited food choices, can help promote better health outcomes. By adding vitamins and minerals to staple foods, populations that may have limited access to a variety of foods can receive essential nutrients.
5. Reduces Healthcare Costs
The cost of treating nutrient deficiencies in hospitals can be significant, particularly for individuals who lack adequate insurance. Reducing the incidence of nutrient deficiencies through food fortification and functional foods can help healthcare systems save money by improving health outcomes for individuals and communities.
Drawbacks of Adding Micronutrients to Widely Consumed Food Products
Despite the potential benefits of micro-nutrient fortification, some drawbacks exist. This includes the following:
1. Overconsumption of Micronutrients
The excessive consumption of micronutrient-fortified foods can lead to toxic levels of various vitamins and minerals in the body. For instance, consuming excess vitamin A can result in a syndrome called hypervitaminosis A, which can cause dizziness, nausea, liver damage, and other health problems, including birth defects.
2. Reduced Nutrient Absorption
Excessive consumption of fortified foods can also interfere with nutrient absorption in the body. Consuming excess iron can inhibit zinc absorption, leading to zinc deficiency. Zinc is essential for hormonal and immune system function and plays a crucial role in fetal development. 
3. Technological Limitations
Adding micronutrients to food products can be challenging from a technological standpoint, given that certain additives, especially vitamins, are temperature and light-sensitive and may deplete when exposed. Additionally, some fortified foods may not maintain their fortified nutrient levels during their shelf life, rendering them potentially benign over time.
4. Negative Impact on Taste or Appearance
The process of adding micronutrients to certain food products can affect their taste and appearance, making them less appetizing to consumers. Historically, milk fortified with vitamins A and D tasted bitter, leading to a decrease in sales. Although advancing food technologies have refined these add-ins, consumers are still wary of them. 
Impact of Modern Lifestyle on Nutrition
Today's modern lifestyle has implications for human nutrition. Busy work schedules, an increase in fast food availability, processed food consumption, and an uptick in sedentary lifestyles has contributed to many chronic illnesses, affecting most people worldwide. In the US, consumption of fast foods including junk food accounts for 37% of adults who are overweight and 33% of the populations diagnosed with Type-2 diabetes (Mozafarian et al).
The reliance on unhealthy, nutrient-deficient convenience foods is increasing, leading to undernutrition despite increased caloric consumption. In contrast, many individuals are still fighting lack of access to healthy foods, unemployment, insufficient income, and rising food costs. The need to address both food insecurity and underlying micronutrient deficiency through various dietary interventions and programs remains critical. 
Conclusion
Given the high prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies worldwide, it is crucial to explore practical solutions to improve nutrient intake levels. Food fortification and functional foods have proven to be effective solutions for addressing nutrient deficiencies in certain regions. However, these solutions also have drawbacks in their limitations on the amounts of added nutrients, taste, and appearance.
The rising rates of obesity, diabetes, microminerals, and macronutrient deficiencies remain concerning issues that require attention. Nutrition education and comprehensive food policies, alongside fortification and functional foods development, present significant potential to combat and reverse these negative trends. Improving access to affordable healthy foods, promoting physical activity, and other lifestyle changes that support optimal health outcomes require sustained investment and support from various stakeholders, including the public.gov, and private and nonprofit sectors.
