Introduction
In their book, Why Nations Fail, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson propose a theoretical model on the reasons why some nations are prosperous, while others fall into poverty and repression. According to the authors, the difference between the two outcomes is largely due to the political and economic institutions that a society has in place. They argue that inclusive institutions, which provide economic and political opportunities to all citizens, encourage innovation and growth, while extractive institutions, which concentrate power and wealth in a narrow elite, lead to stagnation and conflict. In this essay, I will examine Acemoglu and Robinson's theoretical model on the likelihood of an elite becoming repressive, under what conditions a revolution of the masses is likely, and how applicable it is to historical democratization experiences and current ones.
The Model
The crux of Acemoglu and Robinson's model is that economic and political institutions are the driving force behind social development. Inclusive institutions foster economic prosperity by allowing for free entry into markets, competition, and innovation. Inclusive institutions also provide avenues for political participation and free speech, which can serve as a check on power and corruption. Alternatively, extractive institutions limit the broader population's ability to participate in economic and political life, creating a system where power and wealth are concentrated in a small group of elites who use their power to suppress opposition and innovation.
Acemoglu and Robinson argue that all societies are fundamentally unstable, and the odds of a society falling into extractive institutions increase significantly as the elites create an ever-more oppressive system that seeks to maintain their power. As elites become more powerful, they begin to view their interests as being distinct from those of the broader population. As a result, they seek to protect their power by suppressing opposition and criminalizing dissent.
In their model, revolutions happen when there is an economic crisis or political upheaval. The broader population, under extractive institutions, face instability, poverty, and discontent. Eventually, they reach a breaking point where they're no longer willing to endure the extractive institutions, and they launch a revolution to overthrow the existing political and economic structures.
Revolution
Acemoglu and Robinson argue that revolutions are successful when the masses' interests are aligned against those of the elites. For a revolution to be successful, the broader population must also have access to advanced weapons and military technology to defeat the existing regime. In addition, there must be some degree of coordination and organization among the revolutionaries to avoid being crushed by the regime. They conclude that the most successful revolutions tend to be those in which the revolutionaries create new inclusive institutions that provide opportunities for all people to participate in economic and political life.
Repression
Acemoglu and Robinson argue that repression and violence by elites are essential parts of extractive institutions in their efforts to maintain political and economic power. Repression happens when the elites feel threatened by their control over the economy or political power. They use military, police, and courts to silence dissent and suppress the opposition.
This repression can help temporarily crush the revolution. But, it also creates an increasingly fragile system in which the elites become increasingly distant from the broader population, leading to political instability and economic stagnation.
Application to Historical Democratization Experiences
Acemoglu and Robinson's theoretical model has extensive application to historical democratization experiences. For example, the French Revolution in 1789 overthrew the monarchy that had previously enjoyed absolute power and established a democratic government. The French Revolution had been a result of economic and political crises that made the masses discontent and cognizant of their disadvantage. The power and wealth of the elite in France had been secured by institutions, such as the monarchy, that kept the broader population from gaining power or influence. Eventually, the French people revolted against this system and established an inclusive, democratic government that gave equal power to everyone.
Another example of historical democratization is the fall of authoritarian governments in Eastern Europe in 1989. After the end of the Soviet Union, the people of these nations advanced toward democratization, in part because of political and economic crises. The Communist Party, which had held power over a long period, had created extractive institutions that denied economic and political opportunities to the masses. As a result, there was a significant amount of political discontent. The masses eventually revolted against the system, leading to a complete transformation of political and economic institutions, to democratic ones that gave equal opportunity to all.
Application to Current Democratization Experiences
Acemoglu and Robinson's theoretical model is also applicable to current democratization experiences in several countries around the world. For instance, the Arab Spring, a wave of protests that started in North Africa and the Middle East in 2010, was a clear example of elites becoming repressive and the masses revolting against them. These protests started because of economic and political crises caused by extractive institutions. The elites had been controlling power and wealth over an extended period, with no significant benefits granted to the broader population. The people eventually revolted against these elites and forced out several leaders, leaving the region in a period of political instability that has led to some democratization.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Acemoglu and Robinson's theoretical model offers a clear understanding of why some societies have inclusive institutions that promote prosperity and social progress while others have extractive institutions that lead to poverty, conflict, and oppression. The elite that controls extractive institutions will be repressive when other institutions are threatening their power, leading to the broader population's discontent and eventual revolution. Political and economic crises and other structural factors, such as military technology and coordination among revolutionaries, can lead to successful revolutions that result in the establishment of inclusive institutions. The historical and current democratization experiences on which the theory based, highlight the importance of institutions in shaping the economic and political outcomes of societies.
