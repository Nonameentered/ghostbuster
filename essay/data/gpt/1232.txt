A 7-segment LED display is commonly used to display simple numeric information in engineering applications. A Mitsubishi M16 microcontroller is a popular choice among many engineers for controlling the display due to its versatility and flexibility. In this essay, we will discuss the process for controlling a 7-segment LED display using a Mitsubishi M16 microcontroller and IER Embedded Workbench.
The first step in the process is to set up the hardware. This involves connecting the 7-segment LED display to the microcontroller's output ports and ensuring that the connections are correct. The next step is to write the control code for the microcontroller using IER Embedded Workbench.
The code should begin by defining the output ports that are connected to the 7-segment LED display. This can be done by using the 'define' keyword followed by the port numbers. For example, if port A is connected to the 7-segment LED display, the code should contain the following statement: 
```#define PORTA 0xFF```
Next, the code should define the values that correspond to each segment of the 7-segment LED display. This can be done using binary code. For instance, if the 7-segment LED display has eight segments labeled a to g, the code can define the values as follows:
```unsigned char a=0b00000001;
unsigned char b=0b00000010;
unsigned char c=0b00000100;
unsigned char d=0b00001000;
unsigned char e=0b00010000;
unsigned char f=0b00100000;
unsigned char g=0b01000000;
unsigned char dp=0b10000000;```
After defining these values, the next step is to write the code for displaying the required information on the 7-segment LED display. This can be done by using a switch statement to assign the appropriate values to the output ports.
For instance, if we wanted to display the number 7, we would assign the values for the segments 'b' and 'c' since those are the segments that correspond to the number 7. The code for displaying the number 7 would look like this: 
```case 7:
PORTA= b|c;
break;```
Once the code has been written, it can be compiled and uploaded to the microcontroller using IER Embedded Workbench. The microcontroller will then execute the code and display the required information on the 7-segment LED display.
In conclusion, controlling a 7-segment LED display using a Mitsubishi M16 microcontroller and IER Embedded Workbench involves setting up the hardware, defining the output ports and segment values, and writing the control code for displaying the required information. This process is straightforward and can be accomplished with ease by engineers with programming experience.
