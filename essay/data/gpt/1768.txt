Love and marriage are two of the most common themes in literature and poetry. Throughout history, writers have explored these themes through various literary devices such as structure, style, and figurative language. Simon Armitage's "I am bothered when I think" and John Wilmot's "Upon his Leaving his Mistress" are two poems that explore the theme of love and marriage using different literary devices. In this essay, I will compare and contrast the use of structure, style, and figurative language in both poems in exploring the theme of love and marriage.
Structure
The structure of a poem can greatly affect the way the reader perceives meaning and theme. Both Armitage and Wilmot use different structures to portray their perspectives on love and marriage. Armitage's "I am bothered when I think" consists of five stanzas of four lines each. Each stanza is composed of a rhyming couplet followed by two non-rhyming lines, except for the final stanza which consists of a rhyming triplet followed by a non-rhyming line. This structure creates a sense of rhythm and order, which suggests that Armitage's thoughts on love and marriage are well-organized and rational.
In contrast, Wilmot's "Upon his Leaving his Mistress" consists of three stanzas of varying length and structure. The first stanza consists of six lines with an ABABCC rhyme scheme. The second stanza consists of twelve lines with no rhyme scheme, and the third stanza consists of six lines with an ABABCC rhyme scheme. The irregular structure of the poem creates a sense of chaos and disorder, which reflects the tumultuous emotions that Wilmot is feeling as he leaves his mistress.
Style
The style of a poem refers to the way in which the poem is written and the language choices of the poet. Both Armitage and Wilmot use different styles to convey their thoughts on love and marriage.
Armitage's style in "I am bothered when I think" is straightforward and direct. He uses simple language and sentence structures to convey his thoughts on love and marriage. For example, in the second stanza, he writes "I'm bothered when I think / of the water pressure drop / that slows our shower flow / to little more than dribble." The use of everyday language and the imagery of a weak shower flow highlights the mundane aspects of married life that can be frustrating.
In contrast, Wilmot's style in "Upon his Leaving his Mistress" is more complex and poetic. He uses poetic devices such as alliteration, repetition, and metaphor to create a more visceral emotional response in the reader. For example, in the second stanza, he writes "Love's sweetest joys / are but delusive toys, / and like false lights / can only lead to wandering nights." The use of alliteration and metaphor creates a sense of disillusionment and despair in Wilmot's words.
Figurative Language
Figurative language is the use of words and phrases that are not meant to be taken literally, but instead create a more colorful and vivid picture in the reader's mind. Both Armitage and Wilmot use different figurative language to convey their thoughts on love and marriage.
Armitage's use of figurative language in "I am bothered when I think" is minimal. He uses mostly concrete imagery and straightforward language to convey his message. For example, in the third stanza, he writes "I'm bothered when I think / of grouting on the tiles / that seems to crumble out / like teeth from a child." The comparison of grouting to teeth reinforces the idea that the mundane aspects of married life can be both frustrating and painful.
In contrast, Wilmot's use of figurative language in "Upon his Leaving his Mistress" is extensive. He uses metaphors, similes, and personification to create a more vivid and emotional response in the reader. For example, in the third stanza, he writes "The rocket's bright glare, / in spite of frosty air, / would I despise, / whose beauty yields no fruit but in the skies." The use of personification in the line "whose beauty yields no fruit but in the skies" emphasizes the idea that love can be fleeting and ultimately unfulfilling.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Simon Armitage's "I am bothered when I think" and John Wilmot's "Upon his Leaving his Mistress" employ different literary devices to explore the theme of love and marriage. Armitage's use of a structured, direct style with minimal figurative language highlights the mundane frustrations of married life, while Wilmot's use of an irregular structure, complex poetic style, and extensive figurative language emphasizes the more emotional and visceral aspects of love and relationships. Both poems provide insight into the complexities and contradictions of love and marriage, highlighting the challenges and joys that come with such relationships.
