Two-component systems (TCS) are crucial for bacterial signalling, allowing adaptation and response to various environmental stimuli. Unlike eukaryotic systems, TCS allows for rapid responses that are specific to the bacteria which utilise them. Studying the inter-pathway communication in E.coli's Two Component Systems has the potential to lead to a much greater understanding of bacterial signalling, allowing for the development of new control methods for bacterial response, as well as a better understanding of the evolution and ecology of bacteria. In order to progress towards a systems-level understanding of the TCS network, various tasks must be completed including in-depth studies of individual systems, the construction of comprehensive network models and the incorporation of existing data.
One proposed approach to studying inter-pathway communication in TCS is the use of protein-protein interaction assays, in order to identify physical interactions between system components. This approach allows for the detection of novel interactions between proteins within the same pathway, or between different pathways, as well as detecting the stability of existing pathways. With E.coli having over 30 different TCS, this approach could enable the identification of entirely novel pathways and proteins that have previously gone unnoticed.
Another important task that must be completed for a systems-level understanding of TCS is the elucidation of the specific roles of each TCS pathway in E.coli. While the regulatory roles of many of these pathways are known, the specific target genes that each pathway regulates and the relevance of these genes in E.coli physiology remain poorly understood. By systematically elucidating the functions of each TCS pathway, researchers could take an important step toward building a complete picture of the underlying network.
Comprehensive network models are another important tool in understanding bacterial signalling. In order to construct such a model, data must be collected on the structure of TCS pathways, the regulatory roles they play, as well as the interactions between them. This involves the collation of data from experiments investigating individual pathways, the study of interaction data and the amalgamation of computational modelling and bioinformatics techniques. These models allow researchers to study higher-order interactions and identify novel regulatory roles that may not have been detectable by studying individual pathways alone.
Further tasks that must be undertaken in order to gain understanding of the TCS network in E.coli include the interrogation of cross-talk between pathways. This cross-talk allows for a much more complex response to environmental changes, allowing E.coli to respond in a sensitive and specific way. Understanding these interactions is crucial, as they may be the master regulators of pathways, and can greatly affect the phenotype of a bacterium. This could involve the construction of model systems for interactions or the development of new technology to study TCS pathways with cellular resolution.
In order to achieve a systems-level understanding of the TCS network in E.coli, a number of challenges must first be addressed. One such challenge is the competing demands of scale: the need to study the individual components of each pathway, and the overall system as a whole. Over-emphasising one aspect to the detriment of the other could lead to an incomplete picture of the network.
Another issue that must be addressed is the potential impact of environmental variables on the system. Bacteria are renowned for their ability to adapt to environmental change, and DNA sequence switches in the TCS system can lead to concrete phenotypic changes, thereby limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from system-level models. Therefore, any comprehensive modeling of the TCS network must be tempered by careful interrogation of the system in different environmental conditions.
Finally, researchers must consider epistasis, the dependency of pathways and phenotypes on genetic or environmental context. Biases in regulatory analysis and genomic interpretation can skew outcomes, particularly when samples come from different populations or environments. Investigation of inter-pathway communication must be carried out in a range of conditions, in order to understand the full extent of these biases and limitations.
In conclusion, the inter-pathway communication in TCS remains a complex and challenging area for study, but it represents an essential field of research into bacterial signalling, as well as a promising avenue for the development of new therapies for bacterial control. Current proposals suggest that various approaches will be required to study TCS pathways, ranging from in-depth studies of individual pathways to the broader study of interconnected systems.  However, the construction of a comprehensive model of the TCS network within E.coli would represent a major advance in our understanding of bacterial signalling, and with the right tools, techniques and approaches, there is hope that we can achieve this in the not-too-distant future.
