Epistemological relativism (ER) is a philosophical concept that disputes the idea of objective truth. ER essentially argues that the meaning of any truth claim varies with respect to the perspective from which it is formulated. Thus, ER asserts that there is no absolute truth in any given situation, and that truth is always dependent on perspective.
ER is a complex philosophical theory that has come under severe criticism from various quarters. This essay examines the defensible form of ER, analyzes the objections raised against it, and explores the extent to which those objections can withstand criticism. Moreover, it delves into how relativism can respond to objections, such as the equivalence principle and charge of inconsistency.
The Defensible Form of Epistemological Relativism
ER ultimately presents us with the challenge of reconciling different perspectives on truth. As such, there are a number of different forms of ER that one could envisage. However, the most prominent is the Epistemic Relativism, which argues that every truth claim is relative to a particular epistemic perspective. This theory asserts that the truth of any claim always hinges on a particular perspective, making it impossible to determine the objective truth of any proposition. Instead, the truth must be relative to experienced individuals and circumstances.
Epistemic relativism comes in two forms: subjective and cultural relativism. Subjective relativism maintains that reality is relative to the individual and how they feel about it. This is a problem, however, because it means that there is no external evidence to support any particular view and therefore, there can never be any development of knowledge. Cultural relativism is more common, and it holds that reality is relative to the society in which it is situated and the people who hold that view. Cultural relativism asserts that communal beliefs may vary between cultures, and accordingly, our beliefs about reality must also vary.
One of the most prominent proponents of ER is Richard Rorty. In his Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature (1980), Rorty suggests that truth is an historical notion and, as such, changes with different periods of time. His argument was that the truth claims we make are constrained by the socially constructed linguistic and conceptual tools that we have available to us. Thus, truth becomes relative since our perspective influences how we see the world, and our perspective is, in turn, a product of the socio-cultural milieu in which we find ourselves.
Rorty’s insights can be used to build a more complete picture of ER. The implication here is that, while there is no one true picture of reality, we can still gain knowledge of the world through different perspectives. Different perspectives can lead to different conclusions about the same data, making it impossible to establish an objective truth. From this perspective, truth is a matter of perspective and not an objective fact.
Objections Against Epistemological Relativism
The primary objection against ER is the charge that it implies a lack of objectivity and the equivocation of all beliefs. Some critics argue that, if ER were true, then every truth claim would be equally valid, which would render our common sense ideas of truth and knowledge meaningless. This criticism arises from the assumption that ER implies the belief that there is no way to distinguish true beliefs from false beliefs. Critics argue that, if we can’t distinguish true beliefs from false beliefs, then we are left with nothing but arbitrariness. This implies that every claim to truth is equally valid, which equates to abandoning any claim to knowledge.
A second objection against ER is the charge that it is self-defeating. The charge here is that ER involves a claim to absolute relativism, which is a self-contradiction. If ER is true, then it must be true for everyone, which would make it objective because it’s universally true. Some critics argue that since a belief in ER is a belief about the nature of all beliefs, it is logically inconsistent.
A third common objection is the charge that ER cannot account for the existence of disagreement. If there is no objective truth, then why do people disagree about what is true? Proponents of this objection argue that the very fact that there is disagreement implies that there must be some objective reality that people are disagreeing about. This implies that there must be some objective standard of truth.
Responding to Objections
The equivalence principle and the charge of inconsistency are two objections that can be responded to in two ways. First, the explanation given for relativism is not necessarily self-contradictory. While it’s true that relativism presents itself as a universal claim, the claim applies only to how one knows what they know. In this way, relativism is not inconsistent since it does not seek to declare a universal truth, only a universal method for knowing a relative truth. In other words, relative truth is not self-contradictory because it is not an assertion about the truth per se, but rather an assertion about how we know the truth.
However, there is a second response that explains the existence of disagreement. First, disagreement does not imply the existence of an objective standard of truth because it is possible to explain disagreements between people in a relativistic way. Disagreements are a result of individuals failing to fully comprehend the perspective of the other. If one party found the other to be in error, it would not yield an objective truth, but rather a disagreement between the differing perspectives of those involved.
A second response is to concede that disagreement does imply an objective standard of truth. However, it does not imply that we can know what that truth is. Disagreement between individuals might be caused by one’s perspectives, access to information, and personal preferences. If we are to understand the claims made from someone else’s perspective, we must engage in a process of interpretation that requires a creative reflection on differing attitudes and approaches with respect to a given belief. The result may be a reconciliation between competing points of view, but this does not necessarily establish an objective truth.
Conclusion
In conclusion, ER provides a nuanced view of knowledge acquisition, seen from a relativistic point of view. The perspective taken by ER is that we can acquire knowledge through different perspectives, each with their effects on the knowledge we acquire. However, despite its strengths, ER is not without its objections, which have raised concerns about objectivity and the equity of all beliefs. Responding to these objections requires demonstrating that the criticisms are off the mark and responding to valid criticisms by showing how they fall short of defeating the relativist view. In all, the defensible form of ER holds that knowledge is a human construction, and that it is relative to a perspective, not a universally objective fact.
