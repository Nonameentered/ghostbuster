Dunning's Eclectic Paradigm is a theoretical framework that attempts to explain why Multinational Corporations (MNCs) opt to produce abroad, even though they face additional costs associated with working over national boundaries. The theory is based on three broad criteria, known as the OLI framework, which stands for Ownership, Location, and Internationalization. Dunning's paradigm explains that the combination of these three factors plays a vital role in determining the success of MNCs.
Ownership: MNCs possess unique ownership advantages that set them apart from domestic firms. These advantages could include intangible assets such as proprietary technological know-how, brand recognition, or management skills. As MNCs move into a foreign country, they bring these ownership advantages that give them a competitive edge over domestic firms.
Location: Dunning's Eclectic Paradigm asserts that the location of a foreign country where an MNC chooses to produce is essential. They usually prefer countries where factors of production (land, labor, capital) are available at a lower cost. Hence, the MNCs can reduce their production expenses, which helps them become more profitable and efficient.
Internationalization: The initial decision of MNCs to expand across borders is based on their existing market power. Internationalization procedures help firms capitalize on new market opportunities, reduce operational costs, reap economies of scale, and leverage advantages gained from foreign direct investment (FDI).
In summary, Dunning's Eclectic Paradigm gives a compelling explanation of why MNCs opt to produce abroad, despite higher costs, by identifying three critical criteria; the ownership, location, and internationalization advantages that MNCs possess. Furthermore, MNCs that possess unique ownership advantages, locate their foreign operations in low-cost locations, and exploit advantages gained from internationalization are more likely to have long-term success.
