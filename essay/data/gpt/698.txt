International relations, as a subfield of political science, often focuses on the interactions between sovereign states, but there is much more to this topic. International relations involves the study of economic, social, and cultural interactions, as well as the political strategies that sovereign states use to wield power in the international system. For many years, schools of thought such as Realism and Neo-realism dominated the exploration of international relations. These perspectives approached international relations with a focus on power, emphasizing the actions that states took to shape and control international relations. However, the feminist theory provides a more comprehensive understanding of international relations than Realism and Neo-realism by considering the experiences, perspectives, and roles of women and marginalized communities in international relations.
Feminist theory is an umbrella term that includes a variety of perspectives that emphasize the role of gender in shaping political, social, and economic experience. Feminist theory arose in response to the widespread reconsideration of gender roles and identity that took place in the mid to late 20th century. In focusing on gender, feminist theory highlights the ways in which gender norms and expectations shape political and economic experience. As a result, feminist theory challenges many assumptions that other theories take for granted. 
First, feminist theory provides a more comprehensive understanding of international relations by emphasizing the importance of individual experiences and perspectives in global politics. Feminist theorists reject theories like Realism and Neo-realism, which prioritize the actions of states, and instead adopt a more human-centered approach. As a result, feminist theorists prioritize the narratives and experiences of communities traditionally marginalized in international relations, such as women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and people of color. In doing so, feminist theory illuminates the mechanisms through which individuals shape international relations. 
For example, feminist theory highlights the roles of women in peacemaking and national security. Women have been disproportionately impacted by conflict, often experiencing sexual and gender-based violence. As a result, women have taken active roles in peacemaking processes, advocating for the inclusion of women’s perspectives in negotiations. Feminist theorists argue that such peacemaking processes are enriched by the inclusion of a diverse range of perspectives and experiences. In the realm of national security, feminist theorists highlight the ways in which gender shapes policy priorities. For example, women's inclusion in the military and intelligence fields has been limited, leading to biases in decision-making processes. 
Second, feminist theory provides a more comprehensive understanding of international relations by emphasizing the importance of the global economy in shaping political dynamics. Traditional theories of international relations have often been criticized for neglecting the role of economic factors in shaping international relations. However, feminist theorists have emphasized the ways in which gender norms and expectations shape economic interactions. Feminist theorists highlight that women often experience disproportionate economic insecurity and exploitation, particularly in the global south. This insight highlights the crucial role of the global economy in shaping international relations.
For example, feminist theorists have argued that gender shapes the ways in which states interface with the global economy. In many countries, women tend to be concentrated in low-paying, informal sector jobs that lack protection and support. This economic insecurity impacts the capacity of women to access education and employment, depleting the talent pool from which governments and other organizations draw. Furthermore, feminist theorists argue that traditional economic development theories, which focus heavily on industrialization and the growth of traditional industries, often fail to take into account the value of care work and the informal sector. Feminist theory emphasizes the need for a more nuanced economic framework that acknowledges the contributions of unpaid work and non-traditional industries.
Third, feminist theory provides a more comprehensive understanding of international relations by emphasizing the importance of intersectionality. Intersectionality is the idea that different forms of oppression overlap and interact in unique ways. For example, an individual may experience both gender and racial discrimination. Intersectionality is crucial to understanding how power dynamics shape global politics in complex ways. 
Feminist theorists argue that policies and approaches that fail to account for intersectionality are insufficient; they ignore the nuanced experiences of individuals from diverse backgrounds. This approach highlights the ways in which different forms of oppression simultaneously shape the experiences of individuals. Feminist theorists believe that understanding intersectionality is critical to ensuring that policies and approaches are inclusive and effective.
For example, feminist theorists have highlighted the ways in which intersectionality shapes the experience of conflict for individuals from marginalized communities. For example, women in conflict situations often experience both gender-based violence and racism, making their experiences unique and challenging to address. Policies designed to address gender-based violence must be nuanced, taking into account other forms of oppression that impact individuals’ experiences. Intersectionality highlights the need to understand and address the complex ways in which power dynamics shape international relations. 
In conclusion, feminist theory provides a more comprehensive understanding of international relations than Realism and Neo-realism. Feminist theory emphasizes the importance of individual experiences and perspectives, the role of the global economy, and the importance of intersectionality. By highlighting the ways in which gender interacts with other forms of oppression, feminist theory provides a deeper understanding of the complexities of global politics. The inclusion of feminist perspectives in international relations scholarship acknowledges the role of gender in shaping political, social, and economic life. To truly understand international relations and to create policies that are effective and inclusive, it is critical to consider the diverse range of experiences and perspectives that feminist theory highlights.
