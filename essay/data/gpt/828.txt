Stylistic devices play a crucial role in shaping the portrayal of characters and the overall message in poetry. The creative use of these devices, such as sound effects and intertextuality, helps the poet construct a vivid and compelling world that resonates with readers. In this essay, we will explore how the use of these stylistic devices contributes to the portrayal of characters and the overall message in the poem.
Sound effects are one of the most powerful forms of stylistic devices utilized by poets. Through the use of sounds, poets can capture various emotions and ideas, painting a vivid picture in the reader's mind. For example, repetition can create a sense of urgency or emphasize a particular idea, as seen in William Butler Yeats' poem, “The Second Coming.” The repetition of the phrase, “Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold,” within the poem creates a sense of dread and chaos, amplifying the message of the poem.
In addition, sound effects such as alliteration and assonance can help portray the character in the poem. Alliteration, the repetition of consonant sounds, can create memorable and impactful word choices that emphasize the tone of the poem. For instance, in Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven,” the repeated use of the /r/ sound in the phrase, “rapping, rapping at my chamber door,” adds a haunting quality to the poem, heightening the fear and unease felt by the protagonist.
Assonance, on the other hand, is the repetition of vowel sounds and can also contribute to the message of the poem. In T.S. Eliot’s “The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,” the repetition of the long “e” sound in the line, “Do I dare / Disturb the universe?,” adds a sense of hesitation and indecisiveness to the character of Prufrock. The reader can feel the character’s inner struggle through the use of this stylistic device.
Intertextuality is another stylistic device used by poets to create deeper meaning within their works. It involves referencing and borrowing from other texts or works of art, connecting these works with the poem's message and themes. For example, in “The Waste Land” by T.S. Eliot, the use of intertextuality can be observed in the references to Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” and Dante’s “Inferno,” amongst others. Eliot incorporates these references to convey his message about the fragmented, chaotic nature of modern society, as well as the universal themes of despair and disillusionment.
Intertextuality also contributes to the portrayal of the characters within a poem. Through references to other works, the poet can convey a sense of their character’s thoughts and emotions, using these references to contextualize their experiences. In Sylvia Plath’s poem, “Lady Lazarus,” intertextuality is employed to highlight the character’s struggles with mental illness and the societal pressures that exacerbate these struggles. The use of the term “Herr Doktor” references the Nazi doctors who conducted horrific experiments on Jews during the Holocaust, adding weight and depth to the character’s trauma.
Furthermore, the use of intertextuality can contribute to the overall message of the poem by placing it within a broader context. By connecting with other works of art or literature, a poem can establish itself within a larger cultural and intellectual framework, lending it greater significance. For example, in the poetry of Langston Hughes, the use of the blues often occurs as a form of intertextuality. Hughes draws on the traditions of blues music to create vivid images of African American life, depicting the struggles of everyday people in the United States at the time.
In conclusion, the use of stylistic devices in poetry, such as sound effects and intertextuality, is fundamental in contributing to the portrayal of the character in the poem and its overall message. Sound effects evoke emotions, emphasize ideas and shape the portrayal of characters. Intertextuality adds depth to the poem and places it within a broader cultural and intellectual context. When used effectively, these stylistic devices can create a powerful, resonant poem that resonates with readers and endures through time.
