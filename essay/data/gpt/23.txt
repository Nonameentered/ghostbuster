Introduction
Over the years, sociology has undergone several transformations as theorists sought to develop theoretical lenses that could help explain the complexities of society. Roy Bhaskar's critical realism emerged as one of the prominent philosophical approaches that attempted to transcend the limitations of positivism and traditional interpretive sociology. Critical realism assumes that there is a reality beyond what is observable and seeks to uncover the underlying structures that produce the observable phenomena. This paper examines how the development of critical realism by Roy Bhaskar has impacted sociology, whether it can provide a foundation for the development of sociological theories and empirical evidence that can make a worthwhile contribution to society beyond academia, and how Margaret Archer's immanent critique of traditional sociological ontologies using realist ontology has contributed to sociology by discussing the concept of power in the works of C. Wright Mills, Parsons, and Lukes.
The Historical Development of Critical Realism
Critical realism emerged as a philosophical approach in response to the limitations of positivism in explaining social phenomena. Roy Bhaskar, the founder of critical realism, believed that positivism's attempt to reduce social phenomena into quantifiable units ignored the complexities of social reality. According to Bhaskar (2015), positivism's emphasis on regularities and constant conjunctions in natural science obscured the fact that social phenomena are open systems characterized by emergent properties that are contingent on many factors. On the other hand, traditional interpretive sociology overemphasized the individual's subjective meaning-making, which ignored social structures' role in shaping individuals' experiences.
Thus, Bhaskar sought to develop an approach to understanding social phenomena that transcended positivism and traditional interpretive sociology. Critical realism posits that there is a reality beyond what is observable, and social phenomena can be analyzed by understanding the underlying generative structures that produce them. These generative structures are composed of the necessary and sufficient conditions that make the social phenomena possible. Bhaskar (2015) argues that these structures are not directly observable but can be inferred by examining the regularities of the phenomena they produce. Critical realism assumes that ontological realism and epistemological relativism are compatible, meaning that while there is a reality beyond what is observable, our knowledge of that reality is limited and situated.
Impact of Critical Realism on Sociology
Critical realism has impacted sociology in several ways. Firstly, it challenged the positivist's view of social phenomena as reducible to quantifiable units. Bhaskar's critique of positivism's emphasis on constant conjunctions paved the way for a more nuanced understanding of social reality that accounted for open and complex systems. Critical realism's emphasis on generative mechanisms enabled sociologists to understand how social phenomena emerge from underlying structures. For instance, by examining the necessary and sufficient conditions that enable a particular family structure, sociologists could gain insights into how the structure produces certain outcomes.
Secondly, critical realism facilitated the development of critical theory. Bhaskar's emphasis on understanding the underlying generative structures that reproduce social phenomena enabled critical theorists to analyze the power relations that enable the reproduction of social inequalities. According to Archer (1995), critical realism's insistence on the existence of objective structures opened up new possibilities for understanding power relations beyond the individual level. Critical theorists were now able to understand how institutions and discourses contributed to the reproduction of power relations. For example, a critical realist analysis of the school system could uncover how the curriculum and the assessment methods reproduced inequalities in society.
Thirdly, critical realism's emphasis on the ontological distance between reality and knowledge enabled sociologists to account for the limitations of their knowledge and the situatedness of their perspective. According to Danermark et al. (2002), this opened up new possibilities for reflexivity in sociological research, where the researcher could reflect on their positionality and how it influenced their research.
The Development of Sociological Theories and Empirical Evidence that can make a Contribution to Society beyond Academia
Critical realism can provide a foundation for the development of sociological theories and empirical evidence that can make a worthwhile contribution to society beyond academia. Critical realism's emphasis on the ontological distance between reality and knowledge enables sociologists to undertake research that acknowledges the limitations of their knowledge. By examining the generative mechanisms that produce social phenomena, sociologists can develop theories that account for the complexities of social reality. For instance, a critical realist analysis of the housing market could uncover the necessary and sufficient conditions that produce unaffordable housing, enabling policymakers to develop solutions that address the underlying structures that produce the problem.
Furthermore, critical realism's emphasis on understanding the power relations that enable the reproduction of inequalities facilitates the development of critical theories that go beyond the individual level of analysis. This enables sociologists to develop empirical evidence that can inform policy decisions that address social inequalities. For instance, a critical realist analysis of the gender pay gap could uncover how societal institutions contribute to the inequality, enabling policymakers to develop policies that address the underlying structures that produce the gap.
Finally, critical realism's emphasis on reflexivity enables sociologists to acknowledge the limitations of their perspective and account for their positionality. This facilitates the development of research that is sensitive to the needs of the research subjects and acknowledges their agency. For instance, a critical realist analysis of the refugee crisis could uncover how institutional structures contribute to the crisis, enabling policymakers to develop policies that address the underlying structures that produce the crisis.
Margaret Archer's Immanent Critique of Traditional Sociological Ontologies using Realist Ontology
Margaret Archer's immanent critique of traditional sociological ontologies using realist ontology has contributed to sociology by facilitating a more nuanced understanding of power relations. Archer's critique emerged from her dissatisfaction with the traditional sociological ontologies, which she claimed were either overly voluntaristic or determinist. According to Archer (1995), these ontologies failed to account for the context-dependent agency of individuals.
Archer's realist ontology provides a conceptual framework that enables the recognition of both structure and agency in the analysis of social phenomena. This ontology posits that social structures are real but exist independently of individuals. Individuals interact with these structures, and their agency is constrained by the structures' generative mechanisms.
Archer's critique of voluntaristic ontologies paved the way for a more nuanced understanding of agency. According to Archer (1995), traditional ontologies assumed that individuals had unlimited agency, which ignored the constraints on their agency. However, Archer's ontology posits that individual agency is context-dependent and constrained by the generative mechanisms of the structures they inhabit. For instance, an individual's agency in the labor market may be constrained by the generative mechanisms of the market, such as the availability of jobs and the level of competition.
Similarly, Archer's critique of determinist ontologies challenged the assumption that individuals were passive recipients of their social context. According to Archer (1995), traditional ontologies assumed that individuals were passive products of their social context, which ignored their active agency in shaping their context. However, Archer's ontology posits that individuals are actively engaged with their social context and can shape their environment's generative mechanisms. For instance, individuals could organize to challenge the generative mechanisms that reproduce social inequalities.
Conclusion
In conclusion, critical realism has impacted sociology by challenging the positivist's view of social phenomena, facilitating the development of critical theory, and enabling reflexivity in sociological research. This approach facilitates the development of sociological theories and empirical evidence that can make a worthwhile contribution to society beyond academia. Furthermore, Margaret Archer's immanent critique of traditional sociological ontologies using realist ontology has contributed to sociology by facilitating a more nuanced understanding of power relations. Archer's ontology enabled the recognition of both structure and agency in the analysis of social phenomena and facilitated a more nuanced understanding of agency. Overall, critical realism and realist ontology have opened up new possibilities for understanding social phenomena, enabling sociologists to analyze social reality more comprehensively.
