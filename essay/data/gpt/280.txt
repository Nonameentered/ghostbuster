Journalists and political scientists both play a crucial role in analyzing and informing the public about political events. However, their approaches and expectations differ in many ways. One of the most prominent differences is the emphasis on personal biases and opinions in journalism. This essay will compare and contrast the approaches of journalists and political scientists towards the reporting of political events, using the media treatment of the extended parental leave proposal put forward by the Labour government in 2005 as an example. It will also examine how journalists integrate their personal biases into their reporting in contrast to the standards of neutrality that are expected of political scientists.
Political scientists, in general, use empirical data and analytical methods to generate theories and hypotheses based on their observations. Their research is often based on objective data and statistical analysis, and the findings they draw are often intended to provide an explanation for an observed phenomenon in society. Political scientists are trained to remain neutral in their analysis, avoiding personal biases or opinions that can affect their research or observations.
Journalists, on the other hand, are trained to utilize storytelling and narrative techniques to report on events. They aim to inform the public by presenting information in an engaging and accessible way. The information presented is often not based on empirical data or statistical analysis, but rather on the journalist’s interpretation of the events. However, journalists are also expected to adhere to ethical standards of neutrality and impartiality. They are not supposed to take sides or state their opinion on political issues while reporting a story.
To illustrate the differences between the approaches of journalists and political scientists, let us examine the media treatment of the extended parental leave proposal by the Labour government in 2005. The proposal aimed to provide new parents with the option of extending their leave from six months to twelve months, acknowledging the critical role parents play in nurturing and raising young children. This proposal was a significant political issue, and both journalists and political scientists covered the story. However, the nature of the coverage was different, reflecting their divergent approaches.
Journalists attempted to make the report more engaging by presenting it in a storytelling format to make it more relatable to their readers. They highlighted the importance of parental leave to families, discussing how it would impact parents and their children’s lives. In doing so, they often integrated their personal opinions and biases, making the coverage more emotive. For instance, a Guardian article covering the proposal noted that the extended parental leave proposal had received support from mothers, highlighting that, “More than nine in ten new mothers want the right to six months paid and six months unpaid leave, according to a new poll.” This statement frames the proposal positively, indicating that the majority of mothers are in support of the proposal.
Journalists were also more likely to include quotes and statements from individuals involved in the story, further reflecting their emotive approach to reporting. A BBC News report on the proposal included a quote from a new mother saying, “I think it is brilliant, it has made a massive difference.” This quote highlights the positive impact the proposal would have on the life of a new mother, although it does not provide any empirical data or objective analysis.
Political scientists, on the other hand, approached the extended parental leave proposal by examining the empirical data on the proposal’s potential impact. They analyzed the economic implications of the proposal and evaluated its feasibility. Political scientists also examined how the proposal would affect the broader societal issues, such as gender inequalities in the workplace. Their reports were often based on empirical data and objective analysis, making them less emotive than journalistic coverage.
The political scientists’ reports were also designed to remain neutral in their analysis, avoiding any personal biases or opinions. For example, a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research on the proposal analyzed the economic implications of the proposal on families and the workplace, but refrained from stating whether the proposal was desirable or not. This report examined potential outcomes, but it did not express an opinion on whether the proposal was good or bad.
While both political scientists and journalists covered the extended parental leave proposal, their approaches were significantly different. Journalists focused on the emotive and human interest aspects of the story, highlighting personal opinions and biases. On the other hand, political scientists gathered empirical data and remained neutral in their analysis, attempting to provide objective data and analysis.
Journalists integrate their personal opinions and biases into their reporting to make it engaging and relatable to their readers. They aim to convey the message and story in a way that captivates readers and helps them connect with the issue. This practice is not necessarily wrong in the context of journalism, where presenting a story in an engaging and emotive manner can inspire public response and activism.
However, the expected standards of neutrality for political scientists are different. Political scientists gather objective data and analyze the information to provide a coherent explanation of a political issue or event. They analyze the facts and present their findings in a clear and objective manner without incorporating their personal opinions or biases. Political scientists are expected to remain neutral in their analysis to maintain their credibility with other researchers and the public.
In conclusion, journalists and political scientists have divergent approaches towards reporting on political events. Political scientists focus on empirical data and analytical methods that maintain their neutrality and impartiality. Journalists, on the other hand, rely on storytelling and narrative to make their reports engaging and relatable. Journalists often utilize their personal opinions and biases in their reporting, making their coverage emotive. Understanding these differences helps establish the appropriate expectations of journalists and political scientists when reporting on political events. The extended parental leave proposal put forward by the Labour government in 2005 serves as an example of how these two approaches can diverge, and the role each profession plays in informing the public in their unique ways.
