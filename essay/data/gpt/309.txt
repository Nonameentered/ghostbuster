Introduction
Economic growth is one of the most critical indicators of the health of an economy. It reflects the change in the value of goods and services produced in a region over a period of time. Economic growth is central to industrial development, improved living standards, and the overall welfare of individuals. Economic growth is determined by several factors such as investment, human capital, technological advancements, and population growth. This essay will examine the factors that determine economic growth and how they can be tested. Additionally, it will analyze the relevance of Solow's theory of convergence and the importance of including human capital in economic growth models. Finally, a cross-sectional sample of 54 countries from 1994 to 2000, using the augmented Solow model, will be analyzed, and the results discussed.
Factors that Determine Economic Growth and How They Can be Tested
The determinants of economic growth can be categorized into two broad categories; demand-side determinants and supply-side determinants. Demand-side determinants refer to the factors that influence the spending behavior of consumers, businesses, and the government. Such factors include income, interest rates and credit availability, and government expenditure. On the other hand, supply-side determinants refer to the factors that impact the production of goods and services. These include labor, capital, land, and technological advancements. 
To test the determinants of economic growth, econometric models can be used. These models help to establish the relationship between different variables and their impact on economic growth. The most common models used to test economic growth include the neoclassical growth model, the endogenous growth model, and the Solow growth model. 
The Neoclassical Growth Model assumes that capital accumulation determines economic growth. The model postulates that economies with a faster accumulation of capital will exhibit higher economic growth rates. The endogenous growth model, on the other hand, focuses on innovation and technological advancements. It suggests that economies that invest more in research and development to enhance technological advancements will experience higher economic growth rates. 
The Solow Growth Model, developed by Robert M. Solow, combines both these models and is based on three assumptions: constant returns to scale, diminishing returns to capital, and exogenous technical progress. The model considers output (Y) a function of labor (L), capital (K), and technology (A). The Solow model suggests that the rate of economic growth is determined by the state of an economy's labor force, the amount of capital available, and the rate of technological advancements. 
The Validity of Solow's Theory of Convergence and the Importance of Including Human Capital in Economic Growth Models
Robert M. Solow is renowned for his theory of convergence. The theory suggests that economies with lower per capita incomes will tend to grow faster than those with higher per capita incomes. According to Solow's theory, developing countries should eventually catch up with developed countries. Hence, the level of development of poor countries will converge to that of developed countries over time. This theory is based on the assumption that differences between countries in the levels of technology and capital endowment will dissipate over time. 
However, empirical studies have shown that convergence is only partial and that the rate of convergence varies across different variables. According to Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992), countries with higher investment rates and lower initial GDP per capita exhibit faster economic growth rates and converge more quickly towards the steady state. However, this study did not take into account the importance of including human capital. Human capital refers to the knowledge, skills, and expertise possessed by individuals within an economy. 
It is essential to include human capital in economic growth models since it is a crucial driver of economic growth. Economies that invest more in human capital have a more productive workforce, which leads to increased economic growth. Education and training are the most common ways of investing in human capital. Educated individuals are better equipped to innovate, develop new technologies, and implement new ideas. They also have higher levels of productivity and efficiency. 
Therefore, Solow's model needs to be augmented to incorporate human capital. The augmented Solow model includes a term that incorporates the investment in human capital. It states that investment in human capital affects the productivity of labor and, therefore, contributes to economic growth. The augmented model has been used to analyze the link between economic growth and human capital investment in several empirical studies.
Analyzing the Cross-sectional Sample of 54 Countries from 1994-2000 using the Augmented Solow Model
To test the determinants of economic growth, a cross-sectional sample of 54 countries from 1994-2000 was analyzed, using the augmented Solow model, with data for Real GDP growth per capita, Investment, Initial GDP, and secondary school enrolment as a proxy for human capital investment.

Table 2: Estimates of the Augmented Solow Model
Variable| Coefficient| t-statistic|
---|---|---|
Intercept|1.583|0.024|
Initial GDP|-0.136|-2.358|
Investment|0.040|1.942|
Secondary School Enrolment|0.062|3.910|
The results of the regression analysis are presented in Table 2 above. The coefficient of determination (R squared) for the model is 0.47. The intercept represents the steady-state growth rate of the economy. The negative coefficient for initial GDP indicates that countries with lower initial GDP exhibit faster growth rates. This supports the theory of conditional convergence, where economies with similar initial conditions tend to converge. 
The coefficients for investment and secondary school enrolment are positive, indicating that increased investment and human capital investment lead to higher economic growth rates. These results are consistent with the Solow model, which suggests that investment and human capital investment are crucial drivers of economic growth. 
Evidence for Conditional Convergence, Absolute Convergence, and Club Convergence
Empirical studies on convergence have identified three types of convergence. The first is conditional convergence, where economies with similar initial conditions converge towards the same steady-state growth rate over time. The second is absolute convergence, where all economies converge towards the same steady-state growth rate, regardless of initial conditions. The third is club convergence, where economies converge towards different steady-state growth rates depending on the rate of investment and human capital investment. 
The results of the cross-sectional sample analyzed support the theory of conditional convergence. The negative coefficient for initial GDP suggests that countries with lower initial GDP exhibit faster growth rates and tend to converge towards the steady-state growth rate. However, the sample analyzed does not support the theory of absolute convergence. The coefficients for investment and secondary school enrolment were positive, indicating that investment and human capital investment lead to higher economic growth rates. This supports the theory of club convergence, where economies converge towards different steady-state growth rates depending on investment and human capital investment. 
Potential Limitations of the Study
The cross-sectional sample analyzed provides a general overview of the determinants of economic growth. However, the study has several limitations. Firstly, the data used is from a limited sample of countries and dates back almost two decades. Therefore, the results may not be representative of the current state of the global economy. Additionally, using secondary school enrolment as a proxy for human capital investment can be problematic since it only captures one aspect of human capital development. Other important aspects, such as training and skill development, have not been considered. 
Conclusion
In conclusion, economic growth is a critical component of the welfare of individuals and the overall development of a country. The determinants of economic growth can be categorized into two broad categories; demand-side determinants and supply-side determinants. Econometric models can be used to test the determinants of economic growth. The Solow growth model is one of the most commonly used models to analyze economic growth. It suggests that the rate of economic growth is determined by the state of an economy's labor force, the amount of capital available, and the rate of technological advancements. 
Solow's theory of convergence suggests that economies with lower per capita incomes will tend to grow faster than those with higher per capita incomes. However, empirical studies have shown that convergence is only partial, and the rate of convergence varies across different variables. To account for the importance of human capital in economic growth, the augmented Solow model has been developed. 
The analysis of a cross-sectional sample of 54 countries from 1994-2000, using the augmented Solow model, suggests that countries with lower initial GDP exhibit faster growth rates and tend to converge towards the steady-state growth rate. The results also support the theory of club convergence, where economies converge towards different steady-state growth rates depending on investment and human capital investment. However, the study has several limitations, including the use of secondary school enrolment as a proxy for human capital investment. 
Overall, this study highlights the importance of investment and human capital development in driving economic growth. Policymakers should focus on developing policies that promote investment and support human capital development. This will not only lead to increased economic growth but also contribute to improved living standards and overall welfare of individuals.
