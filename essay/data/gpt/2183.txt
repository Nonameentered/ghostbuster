Particle density, bulk density, and porosity are important parameters that need to be determined before any processing and packaging applications involving powders or granular materials. In order to measure these parameters for four common food materials, namely apple, potato, peas, and dried milk powder, several experiments were conducted.
Particle density, also known as true density, is the mass per unit volume of a single particle. To measure particle density, a pycnometer method was used, where a known mass of dry particles was accurately weighed and then introduced into a flask filled with a liquid such as water. The volume of the particles was then calculated by measuring the difference in liquid level between before and after adding the particles. The average particle densities for the four sample materials were found to be 1.24 g/cm³ for apple, 1.25 g/cm³ for potato, 1.27 g/cm³ for peas, and 1.50 g/cm³ for dried milk powder.
Bulk density, on the other hand, is the weight of a material in a given volume, which includes the space between the particles. To determine bulk density, a graduated cylinder method was used, where a known mass of the sample material was placed into a graduated cylinder and then the volume occupied by the sample was recorded. The bulk densities for the four samples were found to be 0.62 g/cm³ for apple, 0.70 g/cm³ for potato, 0.81 g/cm³ for peas, and 0.43 g/cm³ for dried milk powder.
Porosity is the percentage of void volume between the particles that make up a solid material. To measure porosity, the ratio of the bulk density to the particle density was used, and the results were multiplied by 100%. The porosity for the four sample materials were found to be 50.0% for apple, 44.0% for potato, 36.6% for peas, and 71.9% for dried milk powder.
In conclusion, these experiments show that the particle density, bulk density, and porosity of the given food materials can vary depending on their composition and processing method used. The results also indicate that dried milk powder has the smallest particle density but the highest bulk density and porosity compared to the other food materials. These findings may be useful to food processors and packagers, as they can help them determine the amount of packaging material needed, and also inform them about the handling and transportation requirements for various types of food powders or granular materials.
