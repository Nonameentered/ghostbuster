Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is a developmental disorder that affects a childâ€™s ability to learn language skills at a normal rate. There are many causes of SLI, but one common factor is a deficit in cognitive processing capacity. Along with the language impairments, some studies suggest that children with SLI have non-verbal deficits as well. The purpose of this essay is to explore the existence of non-verbal deficits in children with SLI and their relationship to language impairments and cognitive processing capacity.
Non-verbal deficits refer to difficulties in non-language skills such as visual processing, spatial reasoning, motor skills, and social interactions. Research suggests that children with SLI may have these deficits alongside their language impairments. For example, a study conducted by Bishop and Adams in 1990 found that children with SLI had lower scores on visual-spatial tasks compared to their typical peers. Similarly, another study by Conti-Ramsden and Dykins in 1991 found that children with SLI had difficulties with fine motor skills.
One of the most widely accepted models of SLI is the Capacity Theory, which proposes that children with SLI have a limited capacity for processing information, leading to difficulties in both linguistic and non-linguistic tasks. This model suggests that the non-verbal deficits observed in children with SLI are a result of the same underlying cognitive processing restrictions that cause their language impairments. Therefore, these non-verbal deficits can be considered a part of the overall profile of SLI.
One area in which non-verbal deficits in children with SLI are particularly prominent is social interactions. Children with SLI may have difficulties with social cues, such as facial expressions, eye contact, and body language. They may also have difficulties with pragmatic language skills like turn-taking, topic maintenance, and initiating and terminating conversations. These difficulties can impact their ability to form and maintain relationships with peers, leading to social isolation and anxiety.
Another area in which non-verbal deficits in children with SLI may be prominent is in executive functions. Executive functions refer to the cognitive processes that help us to organize, plan, and execute our actions. Children with SLI may struggle with tasks that require planning, abstract reasoning, and inhibiting prepotent responses. These difficulties may manifest in non-linguistic tasks like sorting, solving puzzles, and planning and executing motor movements.
Despite these findings, there is still some debate about the existence and severity of non-verbal deficits in children with SLI. Some studies have found no significant differences in non-verbal skills between children with SLI and their typically developing peers. For example, in a study conducted by Taylor and Merker in 2012, no significant differences were found in motor skills, visual-spatial skills, or executive functions between children with SLI and their peers. This discrepancy in findings may be due in part to differences in the severity of language impairments across studies.
It is important to note that non-verbal deficits in children with SLI are not universal and are not always severe. Some children with SLI may have strengths in non-verbal domains, such as musical abilities or artistic skills. Additionally, non-verbal deficits in children with SLI may improve with age, school-based interventions, and language therapy.
In conclusion, the relationship between non-verbal deficits and language impairments in children with SLI is complex and multifaceted. While there is evidence to suggest that children with SLI may have difficulties with non-verbal skills such as social interactions and executive functions, the severity and universality of these deficits is still up for debate. It is clear, however, that children with SLI require additional support and interventions to address any non-verbal deficits that may be present, as well as their language impairments. These interventions should be tailored to the individual child and their specific strengths and weaknesses.
