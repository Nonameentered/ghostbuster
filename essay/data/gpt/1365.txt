Introduction
Education is critical for individual wellbeing and social development. It shapes individuals' identities, opportunities, and life chances. Education provides the knowledge, skills, and values necessary for effective citizenship, employment, and personal growth. However, there is a significant disparity in educational attainment between black male students and their white and Asian counterparts. Black male students' academic achievement in the UK has been lower than other ethnic groups for decades, indicating an educational underachievement that policymakers have attempted to address through policy proposals. This essay explores the reasons underlying the perceived underachievement of black boys, how policy proposals have attempted to tackle the issue, and how cultural notions of black masculinity intersect with institutional racist attitudes, negative stereotyping, and peer group pressure to shape black young men's attitudes towards education.
Black Boys' Educational Underachievement
The educational underachievement of black boys is a long-standing issue in the UK. Research shows that black boys perform worse than any other ethnic group and are the least likely to achieve well academically (Keddie and Nixon, 2015). They are more likely to be excluded from schools, more likely to be in the lowest set or stream, and less likely to attend university or enter professions (Department for Education, 2020). For example, in 2018, only 52.5% of black Caribbean boys achieved a grade 4 or above in both English and maths GCSEs, compared to 64.3% of all pupils (Department for Education, 2020). Similarly, black boys are underrepresented in higher education, with only 7.2% of black students holding a Bachelor's degree, compared to 33.7% of white students (Department for Education, 2020).
Several reasons explain why black boys are underachieving educationally, including poverty, low expectations, negative labelling, lack of positive role models, and institutional racism. Poverty is a significant barrier to educational achievement, and black families are more likely to live in poverty than any other ethnic groups (Bhattacharyya, 2018). Poverty can affect children's performance in school by increasing the likelihood of poor nutrition, poor living conditions, and a lack of access to educational resources such as textbooks, computers, and private tuition. Low expectations from teachers and parents can also contribute to black boys' underachievement. Often teachers have stereotypes and biases that influence their judgments of students' academic abilities. A lack of positive role models and the cultural capital necessary for success in education can further influence the underachievement of black boys.
Institutional racism, negative stereotyping, and peer group pressure can also contribute significantly to black boys' educational underachievement. Institutional racism refers to policies, practices, and procedures that maintain racial inequality and block access to opportunities for minority groups (Solomos, 2018). Despite equal rights and anti-discrimination policies, there is still evidence of institutional racism in schools and universities, which can affect black boys' educational attainment. For example, a recent study found that black students were more likely to receive a fixed-term exclusion than white students, even when controlling for variables such as prior behaviour, academic achievement, and socio-economic status (Maynard et al., 2019). This demonstrates that institutional racism remains a significant barrier to black boys' academic success.
Negative stereotyping also plays a critical role in shaping black boys' educational outcomes. Negative stereotypes about black masculinity can influence teachers' perceptions of black boys' academic abilities. For example, black boys may be seen as disruptive, aggressive, or lacking in discipline (Keddie and Nixon, 2015). These stereotypes can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy where educators treat black boys unfairly, leading to poor outcomes. Negative stereotypes can also affect black boys' confidence and belief in their academic abilities, leading to a lack of motivation and disengagement in school.
Peer group pressure is another factor that can negatively influence black boys' attitudes towards education. The dominant peer group norms among black boys may not value academic success or may view it as "acting white." Black boys who achieve highly academically may be criticised or ostracised by their peers. Consequently, some black boys may eschew academic success to conform to their peer group's expectations. The pressure to conform to a particular notion of black masculinity can also shape black boys' education paths.
Policy Proposals to Tackle Underachievement
Numerous policy proposals have been recommended to address the underachievement of black boys in education. One of these proposals is to improve teacher training on unconscious biases, cultural competence, and the impact of negative stereotypes on black boys' academic achievement. Teachers should be able to recognise their biases, understand how cultural differences may impact black students' learning styles, and know how to engage with black pupils effectively. Research suggests that training in cultural competence and unconscious bias can improve educators' cultural awareness, reduce their biases' impacts, and increase their understanding of diversity.
Another proposal is to include more diverse histories and contexts in curriculums. Black boys' underachievement may result partly from the Eurocentric curriculum that does not reflect their cultural heritage and experiences. A more diverse and culturally relevant curriculum can inspire black boys to learn and motivate them to take pride in their cultural heritage. An initial step in implementation could be the inclusion of black history, including the histories of black British people, in the curriculum. Providing culturally relevant incentives, such as promoting black-led literature, music, and art, is another approach to making the curriculum more exciting and relevant to black boys.
The UK government has also recognized the importance of role models in education. Funding programs that support black boys' mentorship and positive role models in schools, universities, and communities is recommended to inspire black boys to aspire and achieve highly. Engaging black male educators to be role models is particularly significant, as they can provide pupils with a relatable example and challenge some of the negative, detrimental stereotypes. Research has demonstrated that black boys who had positive relationships with their teachers or mentorship from black professionals were more likely to succeed academically (Oplatka, 2012).
Cultural Notions of Black Masculinity
Cultural notions of black masculinity intersect with institutional racist attitudes, negative stereotyping, and peer group pressure to shape black young men's attitudes towards education. Cultural ideas about black masculinity often centre on power, strength, and aggression. These notions place value on athletic ability, toughness and coolness over academic achievement, which can lead to black boys' disinterest in education. Additionally, these cultural values elevate potentially harmful expressions of masculinity, such as aggression, over emotional intelligence and self-expression.
Ideas of black masculinity may also conflict with a positive attitude towards education. Black boys are often under pressure to adopt a particular cultural style and behaviours to fit into their peer group, which may not value academic success. This pressure to conform to notions of black masculinity can lead to black boys feeling alienated from educators and educational institutions that do not recognise or value their cultural identity. Moreover, cultural ideas of black masculinity can lead to teachers overlooking, misunderstanding, or othering black boys, as they may not realise that black boys are experiencing educational disadvantage in some instances.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the educational underachievement of black boys stems from a variety of factors that interact to shape boys' educational outcomes. Poverty, low expectations, labelling, a lack of positive role models, institutional racism, negative stereotyping, and peer group pressure influence black boys' educational experiences and achievement. Addressing this issue with policy proposals, such as improved teacher training, more diverse curriculums, and positive role models, is essential to closing the gap in educational achievement between black and white young men. Overcoming institutional racism and promoting cultural competence among educators are crucial steps in improving black boys' educational attainment. Successfully tackling these issues could help reduce the disparity in educational attainment and promote a more equitable educational future for all.
