The socio-economic issues of the North of England in the 1960s have been widely documented for numerous years. From the decline of the coal industry to the high unemployment rates, the struggles of the working class were evident. These struggles are vividly reflected in Barry Hines’ Kes, which tells the story of adolescent Billy Casper, living in a mining town during the 1960s. Moreover, Casper’s life would have been significantly impacted by Thatcherism almost 20 years later, due to the transformation of the economy and society in the UK. This essay will examine how Kes reflects the socio-economic issues of North England in the 1960s, before analyzing the potential impact of Thatcherism on Billy Casper's life.
Kes was written in 1968 but is set some years prior, in a small Yorkshire mining town. The novel is an exploration of the working-class life of the North, particularly in terms of the bleak realities that are faced by the youth of the area. It focuses on the struggles of Billy Casper, who suffers from a difficult home life and, even more than that, constantly must battle against the oppressive system that is primarily responsible for dictating the future of his life. The poverty experienced by the residents of the town is omnipresent throughout the novel. This poverty is seen through Billy's home life - he shares a small home with his mother, brother and abusive step-father - and an inadequate schooling system that is in place. It seems as though every aspect of Billy's life is characterized by a sense of deprivation and an overall lack of opportunity.
The lack of opportunity is ubiquitous in Kes, as is a notion of helplessness that surrounds the working-class youth of the time. The portrayal of the school system in the novel is a clear representation of this. Billy, in particular, is frequently patronised and belittled by his teachers, who seem content with the presumption that educational attainment for their working-class students is shallow. As a result, the young people of the town are considered to be inherently inferior. Such limitations are also observable in relation to a severe lack of aspiration that the region inflicts on Billy and his peers. The message communicated to them is that regardless of how hard they work, the reality of their situation remains that of deprivation, lack of opportunity, and substantial disadvantage in life.
The bleak and disappointing realities of Billy's life are undoubtedly representative of the economic struggles that were taking place in the North of England in the 1960s. By this time, the region had become largely reliant upon the coal industry. The effect on the communities in the area was significant. Numerous towns in the region became a shell of what they once were, and the closure of collieries only contributed to a sense of desperation. Billy's bleak existence can be interpreted as an isolated case of a wider issue - an absence of a future for the working-class youth of the North.
The mode in which Billy’s life is controlled by external forces bereft of progression or imaginative innovations is apparent in the novel throughout. The mining town in which Billy and his peers reside is seen not as a place of opportunity, but one of resigning to the given course of events. Such poverty and struggles brought by the systematic oppression that Billy must fight against are representative of a wider issue present in North England in the 1960s. The lack of contemplation over what the future could look like for the region indicated a perilous future for those living there.
Now, turning our attention to Thatcherism, it is evident that Billy's life would have been dramatically altered had he lived through the economic reforms that occurred in the 1980s. The Thatcher government imploded significant economic and political changes that had a considerable effect on the North of England. Rather than an economy heavily reliant on the mining industry, new industries such as finance, technology, and manufacturing were developed, and new economic regions began to emerge. Once again, though, the changes were not beneficial for the working class.
Thatcherism brought with it a significant increase in social and economic inequality. It has been argued that the widening gap between the rich and poor has been the most significant social change of the past 50 years in the UK. Thatcher believed that economic growth depended upon an individual drive for capital accumulation, which translated into policies supporting financial deregulation, the privatization of nationalized industries, the withdrawal of support to dependent groups, and tax cuts for wealthy individuals. Consequently, the policies put in place during Thatcher's government would have left Billy in an even worse position.
In the 1960s, the absence of opportunity and potential lack of aspiration were issues heavily prevalent in Billy's environment of North England. Under Thatcherism, however, it is conceivable that such issues would have been exacerbated. The mass closure of state-run industries triggered a series of economic and social issues across the region. The sense of hopelessness present in Billy’s and other's lives would perpetuate pessimism and despair for the next generation. In reality, though, Thatcherism seemed to embody capitalism and entrepreneurship, principles that would likely have been foreign to those living in the North of England at the time of Billy.
In conclusion, Kes is a novel that provides a portrayal of working-class life in the North of England in the 1960s. Through its exploration of Billy Casper, it reveals an environment riddled with a lack of opportunity and stifling systems of oppression. The portrayal of the schooling system in the novel offers a clear indicator of the limited future prospects afforded to those living in the North, while the absence of aspiration permeating the town reflects a sense of inadequacy symptomatic of that era. The potential effects of Thatcherism, had Billy lived through them, would have likely exacerbated the problems he faced, with mass closures of industries and an increase in social and economic inequality affecting individuals such as Billy the most. Ultimately, Kes stands as a testament to the struggles of the working class, both in the 1960s and beyond, and to the importance of recognising and addressing the structural inequalities of society that perpetuate poverty and disempowerment for future generations.
