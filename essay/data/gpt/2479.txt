A Petters ACI 7.2 bhp single cylinder diesel engine running on standard diesel generates more power but produces more pollution compared to one running on Rape Methyl Ester (R.M.E) 'Bio-Diesel' fuel. Bio-diesel fuel is more eco-friendly and less polluting than standard diesel, due to its renewable and sustainable nature. Besides, bio-diesel produces marginally less power than standard diesel while substantially lowering emissions. Bio-diesel's strengths more than compensate for its lower energy output, making it a powerful alternative to fossil diesel fuel. Also, bio-diesel's lower emissions reduce the pollution impact on both human health and the environment, making it a preferable choice.
