Time is an essential element of all works of narrative, and its use impacts the reader's interpretation of the text. In literary works, time can be used as a structural device to organize the plot, introduce suspense, and create tension. Additionally, the way time is used in character development can also shape the reader's understanding and interpretation of the story. In this essay, the use of time in Shakespeare's plays and Austen's novels will be analyzed to consider how time affects character development and plot structure. The relationship between time, genre, and realism in these texts will also be explored.
Shakespeare's plays are famous for their complicated plots, intricate character development, and rich use of language. In many of his plays, time is used as a structural device to create suspense, introduce characters, and add complexity to the plot. One example of this is in Romeo and Juliet, where the play begins with a prologue that establishes the setting, introduces the conflict, and foreshadows the tragic ending. The prologue uses time to anticipate and build suspense, while also establishing the main characters and their relationships. The play then proceeds to unfold within a timeline of events that are punctuated by intervals of time that add to the sense of urgency and tension.
This use of time is echoed in many of Shakespeare's other plays, such as in Macbeth, where the play is divided into five acts that chart the protagonist's descent into madness and the tragedy that ensues. The use of time reinforces the dramatic tension, as the actions and consequences of Macbeth's actions are revealed in a tightly structured chronology that amplifies the sense of inevitability. Similarly, in Hamlet, the use of time again contributes to the structure of the play, as the events of the play are framed within the larger backdrop of Hamlet's ongoing struggle to avenge his father's death.
Austen's novels also make use of time as a structural device, but in a different way than Shakespeare's plays. In Austen's novels, time is used to establish the social context, manners, and customs of her characters. This is particularly true in Pride and Prejudice, where the novel is set in a world where social conventions are rigidly enforced, and the availability of marriage prospects is a central concern for the heroines. The novel's setting is critical in understanding the main characters and their motivations, as the constraints of time and the social norms of the period shape the choices the characters make. The use of time in this way adds another layer to the character development, as it highlights the social aspects of the story and provides a frame of reference for the characters' decisions.
Another way Austen uses time in her novels is to explore the passage of time itself. In Persuasion, the novel's protagonist, Anne Elliot, is forced to confront the consequences of her youth and her decision to break off her engagement with Captain Wentworth several years previously. The novel explores the challenges of reclaiming lost opportunities, as Anne struggles to find a way to reconcile her present life with her past. This use of time gives Austen's novel a large degree of emotional depth, as it connects the heroine's past with her present. The novel's events are spread over time, which allows for a more in-depth exploration of Anne's character and a better understanding of her motivations.
The use of time in literary works can also impact the realism of the story. For example, the use of time in Shakespeare's plays is often used to add to the play's realism by providing a sense of time and place. Similarly, the use of time in Austen's novels provides a sense of authenticity, as the social norms and customs conveyed are accurate representations of the time. In this way, the use of time can be seen as an essential element in creating a realistic portrayal of a world that is not our own.
In addition, the different genres of literary works can impact the way time is used. For example, the use of time in Shakespeare's plays is influenced by the dramatic structure of a play, which is typically divided into acts and scenes. In contrast, the use of time in Austen's novels is characterized by a more linear structure, where the events of the story proceed in a relatively straightforward progression. The use of time in each work is unique, reflecting the genre and intended effect of the narrative.
Austen and Shakespeare's use of time involves character development as well. In both authors' works, time provides a means for exploring character motivations and the effects of their choices on themselves and those around them. This exploration of character development and consequences is ultimately what makes these works so enduring and impactful. As an example, in Macbeth, the use of time to chart the protagonist's descent into madness allows the reader to see how his choices impact his personality and those around him, culminating in a tragic ending. Similarly, in Austen's Pride and Prejudice, the use of time to detail the characters' social customs and concerns provides insights into their personalities and motivations, adding to the complexity of their portrayal.
In conclusion, the use of time in Shakespeare's plays and Austen's novels plays a significant role in the reader's interpretation of the works. In Shakespeare's plays, time is often used to create dramatic tension and contribute to the plot's structure. In contrast, Austen uses time to establish social contexts and explore the passage of time. However, both authors' use of time is critical in providing a realistic portrayal of their respective worlds and deepening the character development. The relationship between time, genre, and realism is an essential aspect of both works and highlights the unique ways that literary works can utilize time to shape the reader's interpretation.
