Introduction
In health and social care, various social relationships exist. Health care professionals and patients form a central part of these relationships, with the interactions between them having significant implications for patient treatment and overall well-being. In this essay, I will analyze the different types of social relationships in health and social care and discuss how partnerships between health care professionals and patients can benefit treatment and overall well-being. In addition, I will address how the different models of health, including medical, social, and biopsychosocial, influence how health care professionals approach patient care and identify potential barriers to implementing client-centered practice.
Different Types of Social Relationships in Health and Social Care
In health and social care, various social relationships exist, such as professional-patient, professional-professional, and patient-patient relationships. These relationships can have either positive or negative impacts on patient treatment and overall well-being.
Professional-Patient Relationships
Professional-patient relationships refer to the interactions between health care professionals, including doctors, nurses, and therapists, and patients during the delivery of health care services. Several models depict professional-patient relationships, including the paternalistic, informative, interpretive, and deliberative models.
Paternalistic Model
In the paternalistic model, health care professionals assume the responsibility of making medical decisions for patients since they believe that they possess more knowledge and experience in the field of health care than patients themselves do. This model assumes that patients are passive recipients of care and, as such, they do not have an active role in decision-making and treatment (Schulz et al., 2020). Although this approach is common in emergency medical situations, it is not appropriate for chronic illnesses or health conditions that require patients to be engaged in their care.
Informative Model
In the informative model, health care professionals provide information to patients about their health conditions and different treatment options. Patients are then empowered to make autonomous decisions about their care based on their personal preferences, values, and beliefs (Beauchamp & Childress, 2019). This approach is appropriate for patients who prefer to be involved in their care and who have the required knowledge and skills to make informed decisions.
Interpretive Model
In the interpretive model, health care professionals assume the role of an educator rather than a decision-maker by providing patients with detailed explanations about their health conditions and treatment options. Professionals then work with patients to explore their personal values and preferences to achieve a shared understanding and identify treatment goals (Schulz et al., 2020). This model is useful in cases where patients have complex health conditions that require customized treatment options.
Deliberative Model
The deliberative model incorporates all elements of the informative and interpretive models, whereby health care professionals provide patients with detailed information about their health conditions and considering their personal values, preferences, and beliefs to decide on the most appropriate treatment options (Beauchamp & Childress, 2019). This model emphasizes collaborative decision-making between health care professionals and patients to create personalized and cooperative approaches to health care.
Professional-Professional Relationships
The professional-professional relationships refer to interactions between healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, and other medical experts in the provision of quality health care services. These relationships play a critical role in determining the quality of care provided, especially in complex health conditions that require interdisciplinary collaboration.
Patient-Patient Relationships
Patient-patient relationships refer to the interactions between patients during their stay in health care facilities. Such relationships can significantly impact patients' emotional wellness, with individuals offering each other support and encouragement through their illness journey.
Partnerships between Health Care Professionals and Patients in Health and Social Care
Partnerships between health care professionals and patients establish critical relationships and positive outcomes for patient treatment and overall well-being. Such partnerships involve an active collaboration between both parties in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of health care services. Effective partnerships have been shown to improve patient satisfaction, reduce the need for hospitalization, and enhance patient treatment outcomes (Rushton et al., 2021).
Benefits of Partnerships between Health Care Professionals and Patients
Improves Patient Autonomy
The partnership approach improves patient autonomy by ensuring they have an active role in their care process. This collaboration empowers patients to make informed decisions about their health, thus reducing the likelihood of anxiety, fear, and uncertainty during the care process.
Improves Patient Satisfaction
Partnership takes into account patients' views, feelings, and preferences, leading to increased satisfaction. Patients who feel that they are active partners in their care are more likely to report high levels of satisfaction, ensuring that their individual needs and preferences are met.
Improves Information Sharing
Effective partnerships promote communication and information sharing between health care professionals and patients. Communication ensures that patients receive up-to-date information about their health conditions, treatment plans, test results, medications, and potential side effects.
Identifying the Barriers to Implementing Client-Centered Practice
Although the concept of client-centered practice has gained considerable attention in recent years, its implementation in health and social care remains a challenge for many health care professionals. The following factors are significant barriers:
Lack of Training and Resources
The shift in focus from the traditional approach to client-centered practice requires extensive training for health care professionals to acquire practical knowledge and skills critical to the implementation of client-centered practice. Additionally, the lack of essential resources required to implement client-centered practice, such as information technology, can pose a significant challenge to undertaking the shifts necessary.
Resistance to Change
Some health care professionals may be reluctant to abandon their traditional approaches to care deliberately. Such professionals may resist client-centered practice and cling to conventional methods, citing familiarity and routine as reasons.
Outcome-Driven Culture
The outcome-driven culture of health and social care can create an environment that prioritizes targets and goals over the patient's experience. Health care professionals may tend to focus on achieving desired outcomes without taking the time to listen to patients actively.
Medical, Social, and Biopsychosocial Models of Health
The medical, social, and biopsychosocial models of health determine how health care professionals approach patient care. The medical model focuses on diagnosing and treating sickness, the social model seeks to understand the social determinants of health, and the biopsychosocial model takes into account the physical, psychological, and social factors that impact a patient's health.
Medical Model of Health
The medical model of health embraces the traditional disease-centered approach to health care, emphasizing diagnosis and treatment. The medical model is vital in situations requiring acute medical assessment and treatment, such as acute illness and injury.
Social Model of Health
Unlike the medical model, the social model of health focuses on the social determinants of health and recognizes that health outcomes are a direct result of social, economic, and cultural factors. The social model emphasizes social interventions, addressing uneven distributions of power, creating supportive environments, and equitable access to resources.
Biopsychosocial Model of Health
The biopsychosocial model of health recognizes the contribution of biological, psychological, and social factors of disease. The model acknowledges that these factors interact in complex ways in disease causation and treatment, championing a person-centered approach to care. The biopsychosocial model recognizes the importance of patient engagement, personal relationships, and collaboration between patients and healthcare professionals in enhancing health outcomes.
Conclusion
In conclusion, social relationships in health and social care are essential for positive patient outcomes. Professional-patient, professional-professional, and patient-patient relationships exist in health and social care and have a significant impact on patient treatment and overall well-being. Effective partnerships between health care professionals and patients are a crucial aspect of improving patient satisfaction, autonomy, and information sharing. However, gaps exist in the realization of client-centered practice with lacking training and resources, resistance to change and outcome-driven culture being the significant barriers. Finally, healthcare professionals are encouraged to adopt the biopsychosocial model of health, which emphasizes the importance of patient engagement and collaboration to enhance patient outcomes.
