Employee involvement (EI) is an approach in which organizations involve their employees in decision-making processes, seek input from them, and inform them about issues that affect them. While this approach has been in use for several decades, there has been a renewed interest in EI in recent years. As a result, many UK employers have adopted direct EI techniques to boost employee engagement and improve organizational performance. The purpose of this essay is to examine the motives for UK employers to operate direct employee involvement (EI) techniques, and what benefits they have gained from this approach. Additionally, this essay will analyze empirical evidence from the Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (WIRS) and Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS) to evaluate the use of direct EI techniques by UK organizations and assess the key factors shaping direct participation within organizations, including competition and pressure from the product market, the adoption of EI as a part of "soft" human resource management, eliminating the role of trade unions, and fashion. Finally, it will provide implications for UK organizations based on the critical assessment of the benefits gained through the use of direct EI techniques. 
The motives for UK employers to operate direct EI techniques are varied, but they all result in the same outcome, which is an improvement in organizational performance. Some of the motives for operating direct EI techniques include improving employee engagement and morale, reducing labor turnover and absenteeism, increasing productivity, and improving quality. Employee involvement is also seen as a way to reduce the influence of trade unions and avoid costly labor disputes. 
One of the primary benefits of direct EI techniques is improved employee engagement and morale. The more involved employees feel in their work, the greater their job satisfaction and morale, which, in turn, leads to improved productivity and increased job performance. According to the Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS), organizations that involve their employees in key decision-making processes have a more engaged and committed workforce. This finding highlights the importance of EI in improving employee engagement and morale. 
Another key benefit of direct EI techniques is that they reduce labor turnover and absenteeism. Because employees feel more involved in their work and have greater job satisfaction and morale, they are less likely to leave their jobs or take time off work. The Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (WIRS) found that organizations with high levels of employee involvement had lower rates of labor turnover and absenteeism, reinforcing the idea that employee involvement improves job satisfaction and reduces staff turnover. 
Direct EI techniques also increase productivity and efficiency. By involving employees in decision-making processes and providing them with a sense of ownership and responsibility, organizations can increase the productivity and efficiency of their workforce. The Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS) found that workplaces with high levels of employee involvement reported higher productivity levels, suggesting that direct EI techniques can have a positive impact on organizational performance. 
By adopting direct EI techniques, organizations can improve the quality of their products or services. This is because employees have a greater understanding of the production process and often have more insight into how to improve the quality of their work. The Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (WIRS) found that organizations that used EI techniques had higher quality products or services, reinforcing the belief that employee involvement can lead to better quality outcomes. 
One of the driving factors that are pushing employers to adopt direct EI techniques is competition and pressure from the product market. In a competitive market, organizations must find ways to differentiate themselves from their competitors to remain profitable. Adopting direct EI techniques can provide an organization with a competitive edge by allowing them to improve their performance and productivity. This is especially true in industries where innovation and quality are essential to staying competitive. Direct EI allows organizations to tap into the creativity and innovation of their employees, which can lead to new products or services that can give an organization a competitive advantage. 
Another factor that motivates UK employers to use direct EI techniques is the adoption of EI as a part of "soft" human resource management. Soft HRM refers to a people-centered approach to managing employees that emphasizes employee engagement, collaboration, and open communication. Direct EI techniques are consistent with the principles of soft HRM and are seen as a way to foster a more positive employee experience. By adopting soft HRM practices, organizations are hoping to create a more engaged and committed workforce that is more productive and efficient. 
Eliminating the role of trade unions is another factor that motivates UK employers to use direct EI techniques. Historically, trade unions have played a significant role in representing the interests of workers in the UK, negotiating wages, and benefits on behalf of their members. However, in recent years, there has been a decline in the number of unionized workers in the UK. Direct EI techniques can provide organizations with an alternative to union representation by giving employees a voice in the decision-making process. By involving employees in decisions that affect them, organizations can avoid costly disputes with trade unions, which can have a negative impact on organizational performance. 
Finally, fashion is another factor driving the adoption of direct EI techniques. There is a growing trend among employers to adopt the latest management practices and techniques, including direct EI, to stay up to date with current trends. This is particularly true in the technology sector, where innovative management practices are seen as a way to attract and retain the best talent. In some cases, employers may adopt direct EI techniques simply because they are fashionable or because their competitors are doing it. 
In conclusion, direct EI techniques have become an increasingly important tool for UK employers looking to improve organizational performance. The adoption of direct EI techniques is driven by a range of factors, including competition and pressure from the product market, the adoption of EI as a part of "soft" human resource management, eliminating the role of trade unions, and fashion. Empirical evidence from the Workplace Industrial Relations Survey (WIRS) and Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS) suggests that direct EI techniques can improve employee engagement and morale, reduce labor turnover and absenteeism, increase productivity, and improve the quality of products or services. As such, UK organizations should consider adopting direct EI techniques as a means of improving their organizational performance and remaining competitive in a rapidly changing business environment.
