Contextualizing Renaissance Drama
Before diving into the specifics of Shakespeare and Marlowe's works, it is necessary to understand the broader context of Renaissance drama. The era from the late 16th century to the mid-17th century witnessed a significant shift in the theatrical landscape, with the emergence of new forms of playwriting. Renaissance drama was characterized by the revival of classical themes, the use of prose and verse, and the incorporation of music and dance. The language became a primary tool for expressing emotions and ideas, enabling playwrights to create a heightened experience for the audience.
Shakespeare and Marlowe: Language as Spectacle
Shakespeare's plays are known for their poetic language, which creates a sense of grandeur and beauty. He used blank verse, a form of verse without rhyme, to create a naturalistic rhythm and tone. In Hamlet, for instance, Shakespeare used language to create a vivid description of the protagonist's emotions and inner struggles. Hamlet's soliloquies, in which he contemplates life, death, and revenge, are famous for their lyrical quality and philosophical depth. In his speech, "To be or not to be," Hamlet contemplates the meaning of life and death, stating, "To be, or not to be, that is the question:/ Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer/ The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,/ Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,/ And, by opposing, end them."
Similarly, Marlowe's plays are known for their poetic language and rich imagery. His use of iambic pentameter, a form of metered verse, created a distinctive rhythm and cadence. In Doctor Faustus, for instance, Marlowe used language to create a vivid picture of the protagonist's ambition and arrogance. Faustus, a scholar who sells his soul to the devil, exclaims, "O, what a world of profit and delight,/ Of power, of honor, of omnipotence,/ Is promised to the studious artisan!/ All things that move between the quiet poles/ Shall be at my command."
In both Shakespeare and Marlowe's works, language was a spectacle in its own right. Through the use of rhythm, meter, and imagery, they created a heightened experience for the audience, drawing them into the world of the play.
Language as a Tool for Characterization
Language was also a vital tool for characterization in Renaissance drama. Shakespeare and Marlowe used language to create complex, multi-dimensional characters that were both relatable and memorable. For instance, in Macbeth, Shakespeare used language to create a vivid portrait of the protagonist's ambition and guilt. Lady Macbeth, his wife, is portrayed as an ambitious and cunning character who persuades Macbeth to murder King Duncan. Her famous speech, "Out, damned spot," is a powerful example of Shakespeare's use of language to convey a character's guilt and despair.
Likewise, in Marlowe's Tamburlaine, the eponymous character is portrayed as a fierce and ambitious conqueror who seeks to conquer the world. Marlowe used language to create a vivid portrait of his personality and his desire for power, stating, "Nature that framed us of four elements,/ Warring within our breasts for regiment,/ Doth teach us all to have aspiring minds:/ Our souls, whose faculties can comprehend/ The wondrous architecture of the world/ And measure every wandering planet's course,/ Still climbed and close in an eternal search,/ Seeking the God that made the world."
Language as a Tool for Plot and Theme
Finally, language was a vital tool for plot and theme in Renaissance drama. Both Shakespeare and Marlowe used language to explore universal themes, such as love, death, power, and morality. For instance, in Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare used language to create a vivid picture of love and its consequences. The play's famous balcony scene, in which Romeo declares his love for Juliet, is a powerful example of Shakespeare's use of language to explore the theme of love.
Likewise, in Marlowe's The Jew of Malta, the theme of greed and corruption is explored through the character of Barabas, a Jewish merchant who seeks revenge against the Christian community that has persecuted him. Marlowe used language to create a vivid portrait of Barabas's character and his quest for power and revenge. He states, "And therefore let us haste with all our speed,/ To get a conclave of these cursèd Jews,/ That Tiber's streams may be embrewèd/ And tainted with their bloods/ Whose wanton pride hath made me drownèd/ And glutted with the spoil of this proud town."
