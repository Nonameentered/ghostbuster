Introduction
Teaching adults is not an easy task. The educator needs to consider various aspects of adult learning to design a successful teaching session. This paper highlights different considerations that need to be taken into account when preparing a teaching session for adult learners. The discussion is then applied to teach a skill such as a breathing exercise and the various indicators used to evaluate learning.
Considerations for Preparing a Teaching Session for Adult Learners
1. Adult Learning Principles - Adult learners are different from young learners. They have a wealth of knowledge and life experience. Any content that the educator aims to teach should be integrated with these experiences to resonate better with the learner. Moreover, adults prefer to learn through a problem-solving approach rather than rote memorization of information. They want to satisfy their intrinsic interests and goals and aim not to waste time learning material with no immediate applicability. Therefore, the content's relevance and practicality should be highlighted to keep them engaged.
2. Learning Styles - Adult learners have different learning styles, including visual, auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic. The educator must identify the learning styles of the learners to design an effective teaching session. Using mixed learning styles can be more impactful in facilitating deep learning and retention.
3. Management of Learner Expectations - Adult learners have clear expectations of how a course should be timed and what information should be taught. To manage these expectations, the course's objectives should be clear, specific, and attainable. The mode of instructions, delivery materials, and feedback mechanisms should be communicated to the learners, from the onset.
4. Use of Technology - Technology has revolutionized the learning environment. Adult learners prefer technology-aided learning methods such as videos, online resources, and electronic books. The use of technology should be integrated into the teaching plan to cater to digital learners.
5. Flexibility - Adults have personal life commitments that can make it challenging to attend classes at fixed times. Therefore, the teaching plan should factor in the flexibility required by the adult learner to accommodate work and family commitments.
Application of Considerations for Teaching a Breathing Exercise
The breathing exercise can be used to demonstrate how the considerations above can be applied in teaching adult learners.
- Adult Learning Principles - The breathing exercise will be taught using real-life situations that the learners have most likely encountered like stress, anxiety, or panic attack. The learners will first understand the anatomy of the body and how each breath cycle serves to oxygenate the body, relax the mind, and cope with unexpected situations. Anxiety reduction, muscle relaxation, and a calm mind will be emphasized, making the content more practical and relevant to them. Facilitative questioning will be used to stimulate higher-order thinking, and the learners will be encouraged to share their experiences where applicable.
- Learning Styles - The different learning styles will be taken into account by demonstrating the exercise through a video, giving an audio explanation of the process, and providing handouts for those who prefer to learn by reading. Additionally, learners will be allowed to use visual aids like pictures that they feel will be helpful to their learning.
- Management of Learner Expectations - Learner expectations will be managed by providing a clear course outline that highlights the course's objectives, outcomes, and what to expect from the session. The duration of the exercise will be stated upfront, and the content delivery modes will be communicated. Clear communication mechanisms will be put in place for feedback and further clarification where necessary.
- Use of Technology - The use of technology will be incorporated by providing the breathing exercise as a video that can be accessed by the learners at their convenience. The learners will also be introduced to various technology tools that they can use beyond the class session, such as meditation apps that can help in breathing exercises.
- Flexibility - The breathing exercise session can be delivered through virtual sessions that offer flexibility to the learners. Both asynchronous and synchronous methods will be used to accommodate their schedules.
Indicators Used to Evaluate Learning
Effective learning can be evaluated through various indicators, including cognitive, affective, and behavioral aspects.
1. Cognitive Indicators - The cognitive aspect evaluates the amount of new knowledge the learner has gained throughout the session. The cognitive evaluation of the learner can be through quizzes, written tests, or asking open-ended questions. In the breathing exercise example, a quiz that assesses how well the concept of the exercise has been learned, or asking open-ended questions like listing the benefits of the exercise can be used.
2. Affective Indicators - The affective aspect evaluates the emotional responses of the learners. Some of the emotional responses can include increased self-awareness, improved self-esteem, and a better ability to manage anxiety. Questions like how they feel before and after the exercise can be used to measure the affective aspect of learning.
3. Behavioral Indicators - The behavioral aspect evaluates the learner's ability to carry out the task in the real world. The breathing exercise's effectiveness can be evaluated by observing whether the learners apply the technique in their daily lives and report a positive outcome.
Conclusion
Preparing a teaching session for adult learners requires a different approach than that of young learners. Adult learners are different, and their learning needs to be integrated with their real-life experiences. To create an effective learning environment, different considerations need to be made, including adult learning principles, learning styles, technology use, management of learner expectations, and flexibility. Breathing exercises are an effective demonstration of how these considerations can be applied in teaching adult learners. Additionally, evaluating the effectiveness of the learning can be through cognitive, affective, and behavioral indicators, which can provide a basis for future adjustments or reinforcement.
