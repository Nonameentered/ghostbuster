Introduction
When a company acquires another business, integrating it into the existing entity is crucial for success. The same is true for the acquisition of Hoopoe by Wilkinson. In this essay, we will discuss the strategies that Wilkinson could use to integrate Hoopoe effectively into their business, possible challenges that they might face, and how to address staff resistance to change.
Strategies for Effective Integration
1. Develop a Cultural Integration Plan
When two companies come together, they bring together two different cultures, which can lead to conflicts and misunderstandings between the employees. Therefore, it is essential to develop a cultural integration plan that lays out the values and practices of both the companies, creating a new, integrated culture. The plan must identify the overlapping cultural traits that are beneficial for the new company and should be given priority. The management should also involve the employees in this process so that they feel valued. Communication and collaboration should be at the center of this plan.
2. Cross-Training and Talent Retention
Wilkinson should consider cross-training the employees of Hoopoe, and vice versa, during the integration process. This will not only help in sharing of knowledge and expertise but also demonstrate that the company values the employees of both firms.
Besides, the company could offer career growth opportunities to the employees of both companies, showing its commitment to employee retention, and attracting the best talent. Retaining the employees will also help in retaining the customers, who are often used to dealing with specific employees they trust.
3. Consolidation of Systems and Processes
An essential aspect of integration is the consolidation of systems and processes. Wilkinson’s IT team should work with Hoopoe’s IT staff to integrate the IT systems of both companies. Consolidating the systems will not only improve efficiency but also help in the streamlining of processes.
The finance departments of both companies should also work together to consolidate financial processes, such as accounts payable and receivable. The inventory management system should also be streamlined to ensure that the products of both companies are efficiently managed since it's one company managing both businesses.
4. Rebranding and Repositioning Strategies 
Wilkinson may also need to consider rebranding and repositioning strategies, depending on the brand equity of Hoopoe. Once the company has completed its integration processes, it may opt to rebrand and reposition the products of Hoopoe. Proper brand equity exercise should be carried out to ensure that the rebranding does not diminish the value of the product by the customers.
Potential Challenges to the Integration Process
1. Resistance to Change
One of the main potential challenges that Wilkinson might face during the integration process is resistance to change from staff. Resistance to change may arise from fear of job losses, loss of professional identity, and changes in processes, among others.
To mitigate resistance to change, Wilkinson should ensure that the employees of both companies are communicated about the benefits of the integration and what it means to them in terms of career and growth opportunities. The management should also listen to employee concerns and implement changes that can accommodate their concerns.
2. Disconnected Culture
As earlier mentioned, culture clashes could be one of the potential challenges Wilkinson will face during the integration process. Differences in the company’s vision, mission, values, and corporate philosophy could make it harder to achieve a consolidated culture.
To address this challenge, the company should involve all the employees in the integration process and communicate about the desired culture. The management should ensure that they lead by example, and company-wide cultural training programs should be given to staff.
3. Integration Costs 
Integration of systems and processes may come with additional costs such as hardware and software purchase, staff training, branding and communication costs, and more. If these costs are not well-budgeted, it could negatively affect the company's financial performance.
To overcome this challenge, Wilkinson could ensure that a detailed budget has been developed to include all the integration expenses. The management should explore cost-cutting measures where possible, such as optimal use of the hardware bought, relying more on the current team to train the new staff, among others.
4. Competing Priorities
When two businesses come together, they may have competing priorities, which could affect the integration process. For instance, Hoopoe could have infrastructure deficits and under-trained staff, which might require urgent attention. However, Wilkinson's primary focus may be on customer acquisition and retention.
Managing competing priorities requires effective communication between the management team of both companies. A detailed management plan should be developed to ensure that all competing priorities have been addressed, and the integration process is not affected.
Addressing Staff Resistance and Ensuring Successful Integration
1. Involve Employees
The first step to dealing with resistance to change is involving the employees of both companies in the integration process. This can involve regular meetings, town hall sessions to discuss progress, and Q&A sessions with the management.
The employees should be informed about the benefits of the integration and how it will impact their work, career, and growth opportunities. Managers should also be trained on change management, in case of employee pushback.
2. Clearly Define Roles
uncertainty about new or changing job requirements, lack of clarity regarding the company's hierarchy after the integration, and incompatible systems can lead to employee pushback.
To address this challenge, the management should define roles and responsibilities for the employees clearly. Every employee should be aware of their role in the new organization and how they fit into the company's structure. The redefined job roles should be based on the feedback of the employees to ensure that they are satisfied and their expertise put in good use.
3. Communication 
Communication is the bedrock of change management, and effective communication is the key to successful integration. Both the management and employees of both entities must communicate regularly to ensure that there is no confusion or miscommunication.
The management should establish communication channels such as bulletin boards, emails campaigns, instant messaging, and regular meetings to keep staff informed of the ongoing integration and update them on progress.
Conclusion
Integrating two businesses is not an easy task but is essential for the success of companies following mergers and acquisitions. Wilkinson should ensure that it develops a detailed plan to integrate Hoopoe efficiently. The plan should include measures that will be taken to overcome potential challenges such as resistance to change, cultural clashes, integration costs, and managing competing priorities. Open communication and involving employees of both firms can go a long way in ensuring that the integration process is successful.
