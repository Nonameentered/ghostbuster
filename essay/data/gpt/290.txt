The Critical Issues in Management module has been a truly insightful and eye-opening experience for me. I have learned a great many things that will undoubtedly help me in my future career as a manager. The discussions, lectures, and seminars allowed me to broaden my perspective on a variety of subjects and gave me new insight into the world of management. In this essay, I will discuss the most significant learning experiences I had throughout the module.
One of the primary topics we covered was the importance of diversity in the workplace. The seminar on cultural diversity was particularly insightful, as we discussed the benefits of having a diverse team of employees. We examined the ways in which differing backgrounds and perspectives can enhance the creative process and ultimately benefit the company and its stakeholders. Importantly, we also discussed how introducing diversity can lead to conflict if not handled appropriately. This has taught me that as a manager, it is crucial to be aware of the potential for conflict and to be equipped to handle it diplomatically.
The seminar on leadership styles was another highlight of the module. We explored the various types of leadership styles, such as autocratic, democratic and laissez-faire, and discussed how they impact the workplace environment. Through this seminar, I realized that any given situation demands a management style that is appropriate for the type of problem that needs solving. I found myself reflecting on my own leadership style and contrasting it with other styles to see how they match different situations.
Another essential aspect of management that we covered in the module was motivation in the workplace. We discussed the different ways in which managers can motivate their team members and how this can help to enhance productivity. The seminar covered several theories of motivation, such as Maslow’s hierarchy of needs and Herzberg’s two-factor theory. It was interesting to note that while these two theories had different approaches, they both emphasized the importance of recognizing employees' needs to keep them motivated.
The lecture on change management was also a compelling aspect of this module. Since change is inevitable, it is crucial to have the tools to manage change effectively. We explored the strategies that can be employed to minimize resistance to change from employees. The importance of communication came up during this lecture, where it was noted that communication of change should always be clearly articulated and well-timed. The seminar illustrated examples of businesses that had failed due to management's inability to manage change effectively, and this was an eye-opener for me.
The fifth topic that I found most valuable in the course is conflict management. Conflicts are present in any workplace, and ignoring them can lead to toxic work environments. There are different strategies that we learned to deal with conflicts, and one that stuck with me the most is the negotiation strategy. It emphasizes the importance of identifying the problem and finding a mutually acceptable solution that can foster a sustainable working relationship. It became clear to me that as a manager, I have an obligation to enhance the problem-solving skills of my subordinates, and this staff training is an essential part of conflict management.
The critical issues in management module has given me a broad range of skills and knowledge that will be instrumental in my future career. The diversity seminar taught me that embracing people's differences is indeed the key to success. Combining different perspectives can foster innovation, and managing conflicts skillfully can turn a potential negative into a positive. Leadership styles and theories of motivation will enable me to create productive environments where employee well-being is a top priority. Finally, change management taught me the importance of communication and the need to stay ahead of the curve. 
In conclusion, I am grateful for the knowledge I have gained during the module and the opportunity to learn from reputable professionals in the field. The lectures and seminars have broadened my mind and have given me the knowledge needed to be an effective manager. I am excited to apply these insights to my future management positions and to continue learning about the critical issues in management as I progress in my career.
