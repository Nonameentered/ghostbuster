Introduction 
The unification of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics is one of the greatest challenges facing modern physics. Both theories are essential to our understanding of the universe at different scales, but they are fundamentally incompatible. General Relativity describes the large-scale behavior of gravity, while Quantum Mechanics deals with the microscopic world of particles and their interactions. Attempts to combine the two theories have led to significant challenges, and Quantum Gravity has emerged as a potential solution. This essay will discuss the challenges of unifying General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, the theory of Quantum Gravity, its contenders, and whether unifying all forces of nature into a single theory is necessary.
Challenges in Unifying General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics 
One of the primary difficulties in unifying General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics is the concept of space and time. General Relativity describes the fabric of space and time, known as spacetime, as a smooth and continuous curve. In contrast, Quantum Mechanics describes the world of particles as a discrete, probabilistic one, where time and space operate according to the uncertainty principle. This fundamental incompatibility between the two theories renders the creation of a unified theory difficult.
Another challenge is the different scales of operation of the two theories. General Relativity applies to the macrocosmic world, while Quantum Mechanics applies to the microcosmic world. The scale difference makes it difficult to create a theory that can operate on both macroscopic and microscopic scales. The theory of General Relativity has been tested extensively on a large scale, while Quantum Mechanics has been tested extensively on the microscopic scale. Combining data from both scales is challenging and often inconclusive.
The two theories also provide radically different descriptions of the universe. General Relativity describes gravity as the curvature of the spacetime fabric caused by the presence of mass. Gravity is a weak force compared to the other fundamental forces in nature. In contrast, Quantum Mechanics describes the fundamental forces of nature in terms of particles and fields, and gravity is considered the weakest force. Combining these two ideas into a unified theory is a significant challenge that has yet to be adequately addressed.
Quantum Gravity as a Solution 
The theory of Quantum Gravity is an attempt to reconcile the incompatibilities of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. The theory posits that gravity is a fundamental force of nature, and like the other fundamental forces, it has a corresponding particle known as the graviton. At the same time, Quantum Gravity seeks to reconcile the probability-based nature of Quantum Mechanics with the smooth and continuous spacetime fabric of General Relativity. 
Quantum Gravity suggests that particles interact with gravity by distorting the topology of spacetime. In other words, the presence of matter distorts the fabric of spacetime around it, creating a force that attracts other matter. Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of particles in terms of microscopic waves and particles. Quantum Gravity takes this further by describing the behavior of gravitons, which are predicted to act as both waves and particles.
Contenders for the Theory of Quantum Gravity 
Quantum Gravity is not a single theory but rather a set of theories that attempts to unify General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. There are several contenders for the theory of Quantum Gravity, including String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, and Asymptotic Safety. 
String Theory proposes that all matter is made up of tiny string-like entities that vibrate at different frequencies. The vibrational patterns of these strings determine the properties of the particles they form. String theory seeks to reconcile the discrepancies between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics by describing the universe in ten dimensions.
Loop Quantum Gravity, on the other hand, describes space as a network of interconnected loops. The loops represent the curvature of spacetime in the presence of matter. Loop Quantum Gravity is an attempt to reconcile General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics by describing the gravitational force in terms of loops of space.
Asymptotic Safety proposes that gravity is a quantum field theory, just like the other three fundamental forces of nature. The theory suggests that as the energy of interactions approaches infinity, the interactions become finite. The interactions become finite, making it possible to use quantum field theory to describe the gravitational force.
Is a Unification of all Forces of Nature Necessary, and if so, Why? 
The need for unification stems from the quest for a complete understanding of the universe around us. A single unified theory would provide us with a coherent and concise understanding of the universe, from the smallest scale of existence to the largest one.
Unification is also necessary because it will provide a more accurate prediction of the behavior of the universe. The current theories have significant limitations, and unification would provide a more detailed and accurate representation of the behavior of the universe. 
Another reason unification is necessary is that it will lead to the development of new technologies. A deeper understanding of the universe will result in new technologies that can be applied to real-world problems. For example, unification could lead to the development of new and more efficient forms of energy, transportation, and communication.
Conclusion 
The unification of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics is a significant challenge facing modern physics. The challenges arise from fundamental differences in concepts such as space and time, scales of operation, and descriptions of the universe. Quantum Gravity has emerged as a potential solution, and contenders for the theory of Quantum Gravity include String Theory, Loop Quantum Gravity, and Asymptotic Safety. The unification of all forces of nature is necessary for a complete understanding of the universe, new technologies, and a more accurate prediction of the behavior of the universe. As research continues, it's possible that we will draw closer to a unification overview of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, and ultimately, unification of all forces of nature.
