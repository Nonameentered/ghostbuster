Before a contract can be considered valid, there are two essential elements that must be present: consideration and intention to create legal relations. These two elements play a significant role in contract law, and they form the basis upon which most modern contractual agreements are based. In this essay, we will examine the roles played by consideration and intention to create legal relations in contract law, and how they relate to the broader themes that underlie contract law. We will also discuss the validity of their purposes, their consistency, and the potential impact of economic duress and public policy issues on the interpretation of these doctrines.
Consideration is an essential element of a contract. The basic principle of consideration is that both parties to a contract must benefit from the agreement. In other words, each party must walk away with something of value. For example, if a person agrees to sell a car, they will receive payment in exchange for the car. The payment is the consideration, and the car is the object of the consideration. Consideration is important because it establishes the enforceability of the contract. If one party fails to fulfill their end of the bargain, the other party can take legal action to ensure that they receive what was promised.
Intention to create legal relations is another critical element of a contract. This principle assumes that the parties involved in the agreement intend for it to be legally binding. In other words, they understand that there are legal consequences that will follow if one party fails to perform their obligations. This intention can be assumed by the courts from the circumstances surrounding the agreement. For instance, if a person offers to sell their car for a price, and the other party agrees, it is presumed that they intend to form a legal agreement. 
The two principles of consideration and intention to create legal relations are closely related. Consideration is often used as a way of determining whether the parties intended to create a legally binding agreement. If the parties have exchanged consideration, then it is presumed that they did intend to form a legal agreement. However, if no consideration has been exchanged, the courts will look to the circumstances of the agreement to determine whether there was an intention to create a legal relationship. For instance, if two friends agree to meet for coffee, it is unlikely that they will have a binding legal agreement. However, if they agree to meet for coffee as part of a business deal, then it may create a legal agreement.
Consideration and intention to create legal relations are also closely related to the broader themes of contract law. The primary theme of contract law is that contracts are agreements between two parties that are legally binding. The principles of consideration and intention to create legal relations reinforce this idea by ensuring that contracts are formed with mutual obligations and with the intention of being legally enforceable. 
The purposes of these doctrines in contract law are valid. Both principles protect the interests of both parties involved in a contractual agreement. Consideration ensures that each party has something to gain from the agreement, while intention to create legal relations ensures that both parties understand that there are enforceable legal consequences if the terms of the contract are not met. These principles help to create trust between the parties, which is essential for the smooth functioning of the commercial market.
The consistency of these doctrines has been demonstrated over time. The principles of consideration and intention to create legal relations have been upheld in numerous court cases, which have reinforced their importance in contract law. These principles have been applied in a variety of contexts, from the sale of goods to employment agreements. As such, they form the bedrock of modern contract law.
Despite their importance, these doctrines are not immune to challenges. Economic duress and public policy issues may impact the interpretation of these principles. Economic duress occurs when one party is forced to agree to the terms of the contract under pressure from the other party. This may occur where one party has a significant bargaining power than the other, and they use this power to force the other party to make concessions. Economic duress undermines the principle of consideration, as it places one party at a disadvantage. 
Public policy issues may also impact the interpretation of these doctrines. For example, if a contract is contrary to the public interest, then it may be held to be invalid. This could occur in circumstances where a contract is deemed to be unenforceable because it is contrary to public policy, such as a contract for the sale of illegal drugs.
In conclusion, the principles of consideration and intention to create legal relations are essential elements of a contractual agreement. These principles ensure that both parties to the agreement are protected, and that there is mutual understanding of the legal consequences of the agreement. Their validity and consistency have been demonstrated over time, and they form the basis of modern contract law. However, challenges may arise when principles such as economic duress and public policy issues impact their interpretation. These challenges must be addressed to ensure that the principles of consideration and intention to create legal relations continue to maintain their importance in modern case law.
