Elasticity of demand refers to the measure of the degree to which the demand for a particular good or service changes in response to changes in the price of that good or service. The concept of elasticity of demand is crucial in determining the responsiveness of consumers to changes in the price of goods and services. Elasticity of demand can be calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity demanded by the percentage change in price. This measure reflects the consumerâ€™s sensitivity to price changes and the impact of these changes on the demand for a particular product. In this essay, we will discuss the different types of elasticity of demand, how it impacts total revenue, and its application in making decisions about food supply.
Types of Elasticity of Demand
There are four types of elasticity of demand, which are classified based on the responsiveness of the demand to price changes. These are elastic, inelastic, unitary, and perfectly elastic or inelastic.
Elastic demand occurs when a small change in price results in a substantial change in the quantity demanded. Elasticity of demand is greater than unity or greater than one. Inelastic demand, on the other hand, occurs when there is a small change in price but a negligible change in the quantity demanded. Elasticity of demand is less than unity or less than one. In unitary elasticity, the percentage change in price leads to an equivalent percentage change in the quantity demanded. Elasticity of demand in this case is equal to unity or equal to one. Finally, perfectly elastic or inelastic demand occurs when the quantity demanded becomes zero when the price changes, or there is minimal or no change in the quantity demanded when there is a change in price.
Impact of Elasticity of Demand on Total Revenue
The price elasticity of demand has a significant impact on the total revenue of a firm. When the demand for a product is elastic, a minor increase in price leads to a significant decline in sales, whereas a minor reduction in price results in an exponential increase in demand. As a result, the total revenue for a product in this situation falls as the price increases. Conversely, if the demand for a product is inelastic, a significant increase in price exerts a minimal reduction on sales while a reduction in price reveals a negligible increase in demand. In this scenario, a higher price leads to a higher total revenue.
Inelasticity of demand is often associated with products that represent necessities, such as food. Food is a basic human need that cannot easily be substituted. An increase in the price of food goods will result in only a slight decline in the quantity demanded. This is because individuals must purchase food, regardless of the price. Therefore, when it comes to food commodities, the seller has more power to apply a price increase than face a substantial decrease in the quantity demanded.
Uses of Elasticity of Demand in Decisions About Food Supply
The concept of elasticity of demand is essential in making decisions about food supply. The changes in buying behavior due to changes in prices are the primary factors in predicting food consumption. For instance, the knowledge of the price elasticity of demand for meat can be used to monitor and forecast the meat consumption rate and, therefore, decide on food supply accordingly. In the event of an outbreak of diseases like bovine leukemia or the mad cow disease, food authorities may decrease the supply of beef to restrict the number of meat-borne illnesses while maintaining the demand for the beef.
Also, the price elasticity of demand for food helps to determine the extent to which the total production of a particular food crop such as corn can increase or decrease. The price elasticity of demand further helps food authorities determine the level of intervention needed to correct market price distortions and avoid market failures. For instance, food authorities can intervene by providing farmers with subsidized inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides, to benefit individual farmers and increase supply, leading to lower food prices and a higher quantity demanded.
Another use of elasticity of demand in decisions about food supply is in determining the magnitude of the effect of changes in international markets on food availability in local markets. The price elasticity of demand can help identify instances where food availability and price movements in other countries may affect domestic food supplies. This is because a drop in the supply or price of imported food can lead to a substantial change in the local availability and prices of food commodities.
Furthermore, the price elasticity of demand is crucial in informing policies designed to deal with food availability, access, and affordability concerns in society. This involves identifying price and supply factors that can significantly affect changes in food availability and affordability. For instance, policies like subsidies for the exportation or production of certain crops can lead to a decline in the supply of these crops at home and increased export rates, leading to a decrease in the price of imported food.
Conclusion
The concept of elasticity of demand is a fundamental tool in the determination of responsiveness between price changes and changes in the demand for particular goods and services. Elastic demand is more sensitive to price changes and can lead to a substantial decline in sales, while inelastic demand leads to a minimal reduction in sales. Elasticity of demand can help to predict and forecast the consumption of food and the corresponding market supply. The concept of price elasticity of demand is particularly important for food authorities and decision-makers in guiding policy-making on issues of food supply and affordability. Therefore, the price elasticity of demand is an indispensable concept for understanding consumer behavior and making decisions about food supply.
