Price determination theories are essential in understanding how prices are set in the market economy. The two most central theories of price determination are the cost-push and demand-pull theories. The cost-push theory posits that prices are determined by the production cost of goods and services. On the other hand, the demand-pull theory suggests that prices are driven by consumer demand. Although both theories have been significant in explaining price determination mechanisms, they differ in their emphasis on import prices. This essay aims to explore the theories of price determination and their relationship with import prices. Additionally, the essay will investigate how bargaining coordination affects mark-ups and wages and its explanatory variable in the mark-up equation. Furthermore, the implications of Nunziata's findings for labour costs and wages in OECD countries will be examined in connection with price formation. Finally, the essay will delve into Ashworth's estimation of a non-stationary panel data set for 13 OECD countries, which sheds more light on the pro-cyclical nature of the mark-up, and how Chevalier's findings challenge traditional assumptions about mark-up dynamics during recessions.
The cost-push theory asserts that prices are determined by the production cost of goods and services. This theory emphasizes the role of producers in setting price levels. According to this theory, as production costs increase, so do the prices of goods and services. Furthermore, the cost-push theory lays emphasis on the supply side of the economy, meaning it focuses on the key drivers of production such as labour, raw materials, energy, and other production inputs. Cost-push inflation can be caused by a rise in wages, raw material prices, and energy prices. This inflationary pressure will result in a rise in input prices, which will increase the cost of production, and eventually push up prices.
In contrast, the demand-pull theory suggests that prices are driven by consumer demand. This theory emphasizes the role of consumers in determining price levels. According to the demand-pull theory, as demand increases, prices also tend to increase. An increase in demand for goods and services puts upward pressure on prices, as firms seek to maximize profits. The demand-pull theory, therefore, highlights the importance of demand-side factors such as consumer preferences, income levels, and overall economic growth.
Import prices have a significant impact on the two theories of price determination. According to the cost-push theory, if import prices rise, then domestic production costs will also rise, which will ultimately put upward pressure on prices. Furthermore, the demand-pull theory suggests that if import prices rise, then the demand for domestically produced goods may increase, leading to higher prices. For instance, if a country relies on imports for a particular commodity, an increase in the price of such an item will limit the demand for it, increasing the demand for domestic commodities of the same level. 
Bargaining coordination plays a significant role in affecting both mark-ups and wages. Bargaining coordination refers to the collective agreement between employers and workers regarding pay. This agreement has a direct impact on mark-ups in that more coordinated bargaining leads to reduced mark-ups. This effect occurs since in an environment with coordinated bargaining, workers may negotiate for higher wages, resulting in reduced mark-ups.
The inclusion of bargaining coordination as an explanatory variable in the mark-up equation is justified since it emphasizes how labour markets function. In competitive markets, both employers and employees can set wages based on the conditions in the market. However, in a non-competitive environment, there exists some degree of bargaining power, and the wage rates may not be set solely by the market dynamics. In this case, the bargaining power of each party influences the wage rate. Therefore, including bargaining coordination as an explanatory variable in the mark-up equation captures the impact of market labour conditions on price formation.
Nunziata's findings on the determinants of labour costs and wages in OECD countries suggest that wage bargaining institutions affect wage outcomes, as well as labour market outcomes such as employment and productivity. This finding is related to the issue of price formation since labour costs represent a significant component of overall production costs, which impact the final price of goods and services. Therefore, the bargaining power of labour has an enormous impact on the price of goods and services, which emphasizes the importance of bargaining coordination and collective agreements on price determination.
Ashworth's estimation of a non-stationary panel data set for 13 OECD countries revealed that mark-ups are pro-cyclical, meaning that they increase during periods of economic growth and decrease during periods of economic recessions. This finding suggests that mark-ups play a more significant role in driving inflation than previously thought. Therefore, future research should delve into the underlying mechanisms that enable economies to adjust mark-ups during different economic conditions.
Chevalier's findings challenge traditional assumptions about mark-up dynamics during recessions. The traditional assumption was that mark-ups remain fixed during recessions; however, Chevalier's findings suggest that mark-ups increase during recessions. This increase arises from a reduction in competition and an increase in market concentration. Therefore, firms with significant monopoly power can exploit the situation to charge higher prices, driving up inflation.
In conclusion, price determination theories are vital in explaining how prices are set in the market economy. The cost-push theory and the demand-pull theory are the two most central theories of price determination. Although both theories have been significant in explaining the mechanisms of price formation, they differ in their emphasis on import prices. Bargaining coordination plays a significant role in affecting mark-ups and wages, and its inclusion as an explanatory variable in the mark-up equation is justified since it captures the impact of market labour conditions on price formation. Nunziata's findings reveal the importance of wage bargaining institutions in wage outcomes and their relationship with the price of goods and services. Furthermore, Ashworth's estimation of a non-stationary panel data set and Chevalier's findings challenge traditional assumptions about mark-up dynamics, highlighting the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms that drive inflation during different economic conditions.
