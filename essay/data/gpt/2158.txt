Speech is an essential part of human communication. It is through speech that individuals share ideas, express emotions, and communicate daily activities. The ability to speak fluently is a crucial skill that children must acquire to thrive in society and successfully interact with peers and adults. Although speaking is a natural part of the human experience, precise and accurate language development requires several phases of linguistic development. In this essay, we will discuss the different phases of speech development in children and how they contribute to preparing the child for adult language. We will also evaluate how children learn speech naturally without explicit instruction, why imitation is not the correct explanation, and the alternative theory proposed by Chomsky regarding the acquisition of speech.
The Phases of Speech Development
Speech development is an essential part of children's linguistic development, and it is divided into several phases: cooing, babbling, single-word or holophrastic stage, two-word stage, and telegraphic speech. The first phase is cooing, which begins at birth and usually lasts until the age of three months. During this phase, babies produce reflexive sounds such as crying, sneezing, and burping. They also begin to produce vowel-like sounds, which are appealing to the caregiver.
The second phase, babbling, begins from the age of three months and lasts until ten months. During this phase, infants start experimenting with consonant and vowel sounds, which leads to the production of syllables. Babbling is a critical milestone in language acquisition because it lays the foundation for eventual speech. Babbling involves producing sounds like "baba," "dada," and "mama," although these sounds have no meaning or intention.
The third phase is the single-word or holophrastic stage when children begin using one word to express a complete thought or idea. This phase usually starts around the age of ten months and can last up to eighteen months. The child can use a single word to request, protest, or indicate. For example, a child may say "juice" to express the desire for some juice, "no" to express a negative response, or "mama" to call the mother.
The fourth phase is the two-word stage, during which the child begins combining two words to express a complete thought. This phase usually starts at the age of eighteen months and can last up to two years. At this stage, the child develops the ability to use simple grammatical structures, such as subject-verb-object, to form simple sentences.
The final phase is telegraphic speech, which starts around the age of two and ends around the age of four. During this phase, the child begins to speak using complete sentences and proper grammar. Children can use complex sentences and express themselves in more comprehensive and tailored ways to meet their communication needs.
Preparing Children for Adult Language
The different phases of speech development provide a foundation for children's eventual acquisition of adult language. Language acquisition and development are about building structures that enable children to use language purposefully, fluently, and appropriately. Speech development is vital to ensuring that children acquire these structures progressively and in a structured manner that streamlines subsequent language learning.
The cooing phase is particularly important because it establishes a bond between the infant and caregiver, thus setting the stage for the child's language acquisition. The sounds produced during this phase create an emotional bond between the mother and child, hence contributing to the development of social cohesion.
The babbling phase is significant because it allows children to experiment with a wide variety of sounds and words without the pressure of having to learn proper sentence structures. Babbling gives the child the freedom to explore language, which is crucial in understanding how sounds and syllables work together. This is the stage where children begin to develop a sense of phonology, the sounds used in their language.
The single-word and two-word phases are crucial because they further develop a child's grammatical structure. The child's vocabulary expands, allowing them to communicate more complex thoughts, emotions, and desires. These phases also incorporate practice in social communication, where the child learns to take turns and express themselves in a manner that is appropriate in social settings. The final phase, telegraphic speech, is essential in preparing children for adult language because it provides the foundation for further development of language later on.
How Children Learn Speech Naturally Without Explicit Instruction
Children have an innate ability to learn language without any explicit instruction. In the past, scholars believed that children learned language by imitating adults' speech patterns. However, this theory has been largely discredited by evidence-based research.
Children learn to speak through a combination of cognitive and environmental factors. Children are born with an innate universal grammar, which is a set of pre-existing rules that define the structure of language. This grammar allows children to make sense of the language they hear, even if they do not understand the words' meaning.
For example, a child born into a French-speaking family will learn how to speak French without being explicitly taught. This is because the child has an innate knowledge of the grammatical structure of language and learns to match French sounds and vocabulary with their innate knowledge.
The importance of the environment is also crucial in children learning language. Children learn language by being exposed to language through social interaction. From the moment of birth, children are exposed to linguistic input, whether it is from a parent or caregiver. Children also learn language by engaging in social communication, such as taking turns, asking questions, and expressing themselves.
Alternative Theory Proposed by Chomsky
Noam Chomsky, a famous linguist, proposed an alternative theory to explain how children learn language. Chomsky's theory contends that children have an innate capacity to learn language through a specific language acquisition device (LAD) in their brain.
The LAD is responsible for the universal grammar and allows children to acquire the rules of any language they hear. Chomsky's theory argues that a child's language learning ability is not related to intelligence or the environment but is rather dependent on their innate capacity to learn.
According to Chomsky, the human brain has evolved to learn language by establishing a universal set of rules for all languages. Human beings are born with the ability to recognize and acquire these rules from linguistic input effortlessly. Chomsky's theory also suggests that children learn language in a predetermined order and that this process is not influenced by external factors such as reinforcement or punishment.
Chomsky's theory has been supported by studies that have demonstrated that children possess an innate ability to acquire language without adult intervention. The theory offers a more robust explanation of how children learn language, which has been widely accepted in linguistic circles.
Conclusion
Speech development is a crucial aspect of children's linguistic development, and it plays a vital role in preparing children for adult language. The different phases of speech development provide a foundation for children's eventual acquisition of adult language. Children learn to speak through a combination of cognitive and environmental factors, including an innate ability to recognize universal grammar, which is responsible for all languages.
The alternative theory of language acquisition proposed by Chomsky has shown that children's language learning ability is not dependent on intelligence or the environment, but rather on their innate capacity to learn. Therefore, understanding speech development in children is critical to providing the necessary support to meet each child's communication needs, and the theories developed to explain language learning in children continue to enlighten the world.
