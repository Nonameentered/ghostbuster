Occupational performance and life stage of a child are two important aspects of their growth and development. Many factors contribute to their development such as divorce and blended families, parenting styles, educational chances, learning, personality development, and friendships. These factors have been studied in various fields of psychology and sociology. In this essay, we will explore how these factors contribute to a child's occupational performance and life stage and their links to relevant theories.
Divorce and blended families play a vital role in a child's occupational performance and life stage. Divorce is a stressful situation that can negatively affect a child's self-esteem, academic performance, and relationships with peers and family members (Amato, 2010). Children of divorced parents have a higher likelihood of experiencing emotional and behavioral problems, such as anxiety and depression (Amato, 2010). Moreover, children of blended families may experience confusion, stress, and conflicts with new family members (Ganong & Coleman, 2020). Due to these circumstances, children's occupational performance and life stage can be negatively impacted in the short term.
According to Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory, individuals are influenced by their environment at different levels, such as their family, community, and society (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). A child's occupational performance and life stage are affected by factors at different levels, including family and community. Divorce and blended families are factors that occur at family levels. The impact of these factors on the child's occupational performance and life stage is explained by the ecological theory. A child's social, psychological, and physical factors interact with environmental factors to produce outcomes on occupational performance and life stage (Bronfenbrenner, 1979).
Parenting Styles are another factor that contributes significantly to a child's occupational performance and life stage. Parenting styles are defined as the attitudes and behaviors parents use when interacting with their children (Baumrind, 1967). Baumrind identified three parenting styles: authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive. Authoritative parenting style is characterized by high warmth and high control, where parents are responsive and attentive to their child's needs while setting rules and limits. Authoritarian parenting style is defined by high control and low warmth, where parents are demanding, strict, and often discipline with physical punishment. Permissive parenting style is characterized by low control and high warmth, where parents are very responsive to their child's needs but lack demands and structure (Baumrind, 1967).
According to research, children with authoritative parents tend to have the best outcomes and are more likely to have higher levels of academic achievement, self-esteem, and social competence, while those with authoritarian and permissive parents tend to have more negative outcomes (Baumrind, 1967). Moreover, parenting styles have been linked to the development of internalization and externalization behaviors, which are essential in a child's occupational performance and life stage (Olson, Hill, & Wilson, 2009). Internalization behaviors refer to the child's ability to regulate their behavior according to society's norms and expectations. In contrast, externalization behaviors refer to the child's outward expression of their emotions.
Balance's motivational theory suggests that an individual's self-esteem and self-worth come from their perceived competence and sense of control (Balance, 1981). Children of authoritative parents tend to have a higher sense of competence and control compared to children of other parenting styles. These factors contribute to better occupational performance and life stage outcomes.
Educational chances also play a significant role in a child's occupational performance and life stage. Educational chances refer to opportunities that a child has to participate in educational programs, schools, and curriculums. Education is critical in the cognitive, emotional, and social development of a child (Johnston & Rosenberg, 2006). Educational chances, such as quality of education, curriculum, and school resources, can significantly impact the outcomes of a child's occupational performance and life stage.
A link between education and cognitive skills has been established (Johnston & Rosenberg, 2006). Children's development of cognitive skills affects their ability to reason, analyze and solve problems required in the occupational performance. Educational chances have been linked to a child's cognitive development, and thus influencing their life stage. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds tend to have fewer educational chances, such as access to books, educational materials, and quality schooling (Johnston & Rosenberg, 2006). These circumstances can have lasting effects on their occupational performance and life stage. Social learning theory suggests that children learn by observing and imitating others. In a school environment, children have the opportunity to interact with peers and teachers, enhancing observational learning (Bandura, 1977). They learn by observing social cues, which shape their behaviors and attitude, contributing to their occupational performance and life stage outcomes.
Personality development is another factor that contributes to a child's occupational performance and life stage. Personality development is the accumulation of stable and enduring traits that influence an individual's behavior (Roberts, Wood, & Caspi, 2008). According to the Five-Factor Model, personality traits are characterized along five dimensions: openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (McCrae & Costa, 1990). Children's personality traits can significantly affect their occupational performance and life stage outcomes.
Conscientiousness is a trait linked to discipline and organization. Individuals with higher levels of conscientiousness tend to be more successful in achieving their goals and are more likely to maintain a stable occupational performance and life stage. Openness is a trait linked to imagination and creativity. Individuals with higher levels of openness tend to be more flexible and innovative, enhancing their occupational performance and life stage outcomes. Extraversion is a trait linked to social behavior. Individuals with higher levels of extraversion tend to be confident and assertive, enhancing their ability to negotiate and navigate social situations, positively impacting their occupational performance and life stage outcomes.
The Big Five theory suggests that personality traits are relatively stable across time and situations (McCrae & Costa, 1990). Personality development shapes the way individuals interpret and respond to the environment, influencing their occupational performance and life stage.
Friendships are another factor that contributes to a child's occupational performance and life stage. Friendships are essential in forming social bonds, developing social skills, and providing emotional support (Rubin, Bukowski, & Laursen, 2011). Children who have positive and supportive friendships tend to have better social functioning and higher levels of academic achievement (Rubin, Bukowski, & Laursen, 2011).
Friendships follow a developmental trajectory, starting with a focus on proximity and individuality in early childhood and evolving to include intimacy, loyalty, and commitment in adolescence (Rubin, Bukowski, & Laursen, 2011). In adolescence, peers play a more significant developmental role in influencing behavior and identity, shaping future occupational performance and life stage outcomes.
Social learning theory emphasizes the importance of observation and modeling of observed behaviors on the child's behavior (Bandura, 1986). Children frequently learn from their peers when they are involved in social interactions. Positive peer relationships promote positive social behaviors, which in turn positively affect their occupational performance and life stage.
In conclusion, a child's occupational performance and life stage are impacted by several factors. Divorce and blended families, parenting styles, educational chances, personality development, and friendships all play a vital role in shaping a child's occupational performance and life stage outcomes. Relevant theories such as Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory, Balance's motivational theory, social learning theory, and the Big Five theory explain the link between these factors and their influence on a child's development. Understanding these factors would enable parents, educators, and policymakers to institute policies and programs that promote positive outcomes in a child's occupational performance and life stage.
