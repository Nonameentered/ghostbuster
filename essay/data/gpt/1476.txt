Language and discourse have played a significant role in creating and representing gender in literature. The way we talk about and use language goes a long way in shaping our perceptions of gender roles and how they are represented in literary works. In this essay, we will be examining the role of language and discourse in creating and representing gender in literature, particularly in Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper," which has been a significant source of feminist criticism.
Feminist criticism seeks to examine the representation of women in literature and the ways in which gender is constructed, performed, and represented through language and discourse. Feminist critics have focused on the analysis of how male-authored texts have portrayed and constructed gender roles, as well as the way language is used to affirm and challenge these roles. Such analysis has helped understand the ways in which language and discourse create and represent gender in literature.
In "The Yellow Wallpaper," Gilman explores the theme of gender roles using the first-person point of view of an unnamed woman who has been confined to her bedroom by her husband, John, due to what he views as a "nervous condition." The story is written in a diary-like format, depicting the psychological decline of the protagonist towards madness as a result of her isolation and lack of autonomy, eventually culminating in her literal identification with the yellow wallpaper in her room.
The language used in the story is vital to the exploration of the gender roles depicted in it. The protagonist is frequently referred to as "wife," "mother," or "little girl," reflecting the societal roles that she is expected to fulfill. These descriptions reduce her identity to her familial relationships, reinforcing the notion that women's primary roles are within the domestic arena. The narrator comments on her lack of agency and the power differential between herself and John, asserting, "I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I'm sure I never used to be so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition" (Gilman 647).
The use of the term "nervous condition" suggests a psychological instability in the protagonist that reinforces the idea of women as inherently weaker mentally and emotionally than men. This term was commonly used in the 19th century to describe women's condition, and it allowed men to control women by manipulating their emotional states. This shows that the language employed within the literary text can reflect the wider social attitudes of the time, perpetuating and reinforcing gender stereotypes and gender roles through discursive constructions.
The language and discourse in "The Yellow Wallpaper" create and represent gender by reinforcing traditional gender roles. The protagonist is depicted as being confined to the domestic sphere, with her "nervous condition" leading to her husband's control and limitation of her autonomy. John's dismissal of the protagonist's desires for independence and agency demonstrates how social norms have positioned men as the dominant actors in the storyline.
Furthermore, the story's use of the color yellow is significant because it is commonly associated with femininity, cowardice, and madness. The narrator's identification with the partially peeled and yellow wallpaper may signify a loss of identity, along with an acceptance, or even embracement, of traditional feminine roles. The gendered associations with the color reinforce the concept of women as weaker and inferior, and their confinement to domesticity and motherhood. Through this visible representation of gender stereotypes, the narrative positions women as being trapped within society's confining prescriptions and expectations.
Feminist critics have pointed out the meanings that the story produces, particularly regarding gender relations and the effects of the patriarchal worldview. John's role in the narrative - as an embodiment of patriarchal social structures, his dismissal of the protagonist's plight, and his final failure to comprehend her mental deterioration - highlights the destructive influence of such a worldview on women's lives. The story reveals how the application of gender roles, as a form of societal convention, can be used to control and manipulate individuals.
This sort of intersection of literary texts with wider social and ideological issues is at the heart of feminist criticism, which views literature as an instrument of cultural representation, as well as a reflection of broader structures of power relations. The study of language, discourse, and gender representation in literature highlights broader social attitudes towards gender, women's position in society, and the power dynamics that underpin gender relations.
In conclusion, the analysis of language and discourse is key when examining how gender is represented in literature. In Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper," the language and discourse employed construct and reinforce traditional gender roles, presenting women as restricted to the domestic sphere with inferior psychological states. Through this, the story illuminates the interplay between gendered representations within fiction and broader issues of social power and control. By exploring these dynamics, feminist criticism exposes the limitations of gender stereotypes and encourages a critical examination of the social, philosophical, and psychological implications of literary texts.
