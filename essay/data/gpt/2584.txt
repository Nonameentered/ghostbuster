In the field of engineering, sensing devices play a critical role in the accurate measurement of various physical quantities. Among the different types of sensors, temperature sensors have a wide range of applications in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and medical sciences. Platinum film and thermistor resistance thermometers are two popular types of temperature sensors that offer excellent measurement accuracy. An experiment was conducted to compare the characteristics of these two sensors to determine which one is more suitable for specific applications. This essay will discuss the aim and methodology of the experiment, the results obtained, and the conclusions drawn from the experiment.
The aim of the experiment was to investigate the performance of two types of temperature sensors, platinum film, and thermistor resistance thermometer, and determine the factors that affect their accuracy. Additionally, the experiment aimed to identify the differences and similarities between these two types of sensors. The investigation also aimed to create a guide to help professionals in selecting the appropriate type of temperature sensor based on their specific requirements.
To accomplish these goals, the experiment was conducted on two identical water baths with the same geometry and capacity. One platinum film thermometer and one thermistor thermometer were attached to the outside of each water bath to measure the temperature inside. Both thermometers were operated in parallel, to compare the output values. The experiment was conducted in a controlled environment, where the ambient temperature was maintained within a tight tolerance.
For this study, the platinum film thermometer was used as a reference sensor, and the thermistor thermometer as a test sensor. The output of the thermistor thermometer was compared with the output of the platinum film thermometer to determine the accuracy of the measurement. The study was conducted for a range of temperatures, from 20째C to 100째C, with the temperature increasing in increments of 10 degrees.
To study the temperature sensitivity, repeatability, and drift of the two sensors, the measurements were repeated at least three times, and the average value was calculated for each set of readings. Also, thermal hysteresis was measured, defining a range of temperatures from which the sensor readings differed depending on the direction of the temperature changes.
The results of the experiment revealed that both platinum film and thermistor resistance thermometers have similar performance characteristics regarding temperature sensitivity and repeatability. However, there was some variation in the range of temperatures that can be measured with precision. The thermistor thermometer had a better resolution for low values of temperature from 20 to 40째C, whereas the platinum film thermometer was more appropriate for measuring higher temperatures from 80 to 100째C. Also, a comparison of the thermal hysteresis values showed that the platinum film thermometer had less hysteresis than the thermistor resistance thermometer.
The results also showed that the resistor thermistor has a lower drift than a platinum film thermometer. In the long term, the platinum film thermometer showed an increasing measurement error. As the ambient temperature changed, the drift was updated, and the effectiveness of this thermometer was reduced. In contrast, the thermistor thermometer was less affected by the ambient temperature, resulting in a minimal drift over time. Thus, for applications requiring long-term temperature measurements, the thermistor resistance thermometer would be an appropriate choice.
Additionally, the experiment showed that the design of a temperature sensor has an impact on its accuracy. The platinum film thermometer had a significant thermal mass due to the large surface area, resulting in a slower response to temperature changes. In contrast, the thermistor thermometer was smaller in size and had a faster response time when compared with the platinum film thermometer. This knowledge would allow engineers to create customized sensors with a specific design that could meet their requirements and improve the sensors' performance.
In conclusion, the experiment aimed to compare the characteristics of platinum film and thermistor resistance thermometers, to determine which was the most appropriate for specific applications. The results showed that both sensors have similar performance characteristics regarding temperature sensitivity and repeatability. However, the platinum film thermometer had less hysteresis, while the thermistor thermometer had minimal drift over time. Additionally, the experiment showed that the design of a temperature sensor has an impact on its accuracy, with the platinum film thermometer having a significant thermal mass and a slower response time, and the thermistor thermometer being smaller in size and faster in response time. Finally, the study aimed to provide a guide to help professionals select the appropriate type of temperature sensor based on their requirement. This study would give engineers a good understanding of the different types of temperature sensors, their performance characteristics, and the factors affecting their accuracy, thereby helping them make the right decisions regarding their selection and use for industrial applications.
