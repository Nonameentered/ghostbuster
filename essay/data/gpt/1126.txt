The Enlightenment era marked a significant shift in thought and values, particularly with regards to knowledge and science. It was a time when the pursuit of knowledge and the scientific method became central to society. One area that saw significant development during this period was medicine, leading to the rise of professional medicine. This development, however, had consequences for existing ideas of class and gender divisions within British society, which had significant implications for women's autonomy and victimization within medicine. This essay will explore how the rise of professional medicine reinforced existing ideas of class and gender divisions within British society during the Enlightenment era, the implications of this for women's autonomy and victimization within medicine, and the role of gender discourse in this process.
The rise of professional medicine during the Enlightenment era reinforced existing ideas of class divisions within British society. At this time, medicine was practiced by physicians and surgeons who had received formal education and training. They were members of a professional elite who enjoyed high social status and prestige. The medical profession was seen as a respectable and intellectual pursuit, and those who practiced medicine were regarded as experts in their field. This reinforced existing ideas of class divisions, as medicine was seen as a pursuit reserved for the educated and wealthy classes. The poor and uneducated could not afford to study medicine, leaving them at a disadvantage if they needed medical treatment.
Moreover, the rise of professional medicine also reinforced existing ideas of gender divisions within British society. Women were generally excluded from the medical profession during the Enlightenment era. At this time, women were seen as being too emotional and irrational to practice medicine. They were also often excluded from medical schools and universities. This left women at a disadvantage if they needed medical treatment, particularly for diseases that affected women specifically.
The exclusion of women from the medical profession had significant implications for women's autonomy and victimization within medicine. Due to the lack of female physicians and surgeons, women had limited access to medical treatment. They were often treated by male doctors, who were not always sensitive to their needs and sometimes treated them with disrespect. The gendered division of medicine also had implications for the practice of gynecology. Since women were often excluded from medical schools, male physicians ended up gynecologists. This led to the medicalization of childbirth and a loss of control for women over their own bodies.
Gender discourse played a significant role in reinforcing the gender divide within medicine during the Enlightenment era. The prevailing discourse on gender at this time was one of essentialism. Women were seen as being fundamentally different from men, both physically and mentally. Men were considered to have rational minds, while women were thought to be emotional and irrational. This discourse was reflected in medical practice, where women were excluded from medicine due to these supposed essential differences.
The Enlightenment era saw a great deal of progress in the development of knowledge and science. However, the rise of professional medicine had significant consequences for existing ideas of class and gender divisions within British society during this time. Medicine became a pursuit reserved for the educated and the wealthy, reinforcing class divisions. Women were excluded from the medical profession, leaving them at a disadvantage when it came to medical treatment. This gendered division of medicine had significant implications for women's autonomy and victimization within medicine. The prevailing gender discourse at the time reinforced the gender divide within medicine, leading to the medicalization of childbirth and a loss of control for women over their own bodies. Overall, while the rise of professional medicine during the Enlightenment era led to significant progress in the development of medical knowledge and practice, it also reinforced pre-existing class and gender divisions within British society.
