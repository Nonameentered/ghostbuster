Augustus, also known as Caesar Augustus, was the first Roman emperor who ruled the Roman Empire from 27 BC to 14 AD. During his reign, he invested a great amount of effort into shaping his public image to promote his authority and cement his position as a divine ruler. Augustus used various methods of propaganda to subtly suggest his divinity and link to the gods. This essay will provide an analysis of how Augustus used propaganda effectively to suggest his divinity and how myths about his lineage and the founding of Rome supported his claims to divinity.
One of the most significant ways Augustus promoted his god-like status was through art. Roman art and architecture were used to convey the divine status of the emperor, and Augustus was no exception. Augustus often depicted himself in statues and reliefs wearing the cuirass, a type of armor that mimicked the muscle structure of the human body. Through this technique, Augustus was able to create a superhuman image of himself as a strong and mighty figure (Pollini, 2019). This imagery was aimed at creating the impression that Augustus was not like any other mortal being but was a god in human form.
In addition to the use of art, Augustus also utilized literature to associate himself and his rule with divine entities. Augustus was a patron of the arts and encouraged the promotion of literature that was favorable to his rule. Virgil, a poet, and Augustus's contemporary was among the most notable poets commissioned to write poetry praising Augustus's rule. Virgil's epic poem "The Aeneid" portrays Augustus as a savior of Rome, chosen by the gods to bring peace and prosperity to the city and the Empire (Price, 2013). Augustus propagated that he was a living representative of the gods on earth and that his rule was divine in origin.
Moreover, Augustus also utilized architecture to highlight his divinity. At the height of his power, Augustus commissioned the building of numerous structures, including the Temple of Mars Ultor, the Temple of Apollo, and the Ara Pacis. The Temple of Mars Ultor was built after Augustus' victory over the conspirators who assassinated Julius Caesar, and it served as a symbol of his divine justification for revenge. On the other hand, the Ara Pacis was built to celebrate Augustus's success in bringing peace to the Roman Empire, and it served to highlight his divine power to bring harmony to humanity (Pollini, 2019). These structures were built in a way that would elevate the status of Augustus significantly, portraying him as a divine leader and worthy of the reverence of his subjects.
Furthermore, Augustus propagated his divine status by linking himself with the gods through his lineage. Augustus was said to be a direct descendant of the gods, with Venus being his divine ancestor. Augustus also claimed that he was related to Julius Caesar, who was likewise a descendant of the gods. This mythology helped cement the concept of Augustus's divine nature as one that was granted to him from birth and inherited from his ancestors.
Augustus's propaganda techniques were aimed at emphasizing his divine status at every opportunity possible. Through the use of art, literature, architecture, and myth, he was able to promote the idea that he was a divine ruler who was considered worthy of veneration by his subjects. The propaganda surrounding Augustus was successful in shaping Roman society's perception of him, leading to his establishment as an iconic figure in Roman history.
In conclusion, Augustus's utilization of propaganda was instrumental in promoting his divine status and his association with the gods. Through the use of art, literature, and architecture, Augustus was able to create an image of himself as a superhuman figure meant to be revered. Moreover, myths surrounding his lineage and the founding of Rome further cemented Augustus's divinity and allowed him to solidify his position as a divine ruler. His propaganda techniques were highly effective and contributed significantly to his success in controlling and shaping Roman culture and society. Augustus's legacy as a divine ruler continues to be remembered even today, emphasizing the lasting impact of his propaganda campaign.
