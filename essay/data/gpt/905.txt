Michel de Montaigne's preface of his "Essays" highlights the author's intentions and framework for his writing. The preface lays the foundation for the subsequent chapters, providing insight into the author's personal experiences, views, and beliefs. Montaigne's intentions are to share his experiences, observations, and thoughts with the reader in an attempt to understand human nature. The preface sets the tone for the rest of the book, allowing the reader to connect with the author and his stories on a more personal level. In this essay, I will evaluate the preface's influence on the reader's understanding and analysis of the subsequent chapters with specific examples.
Montaigne believes that knowledge can only be attained through experience. Thus, he stresses the importance of personal observation over blindly following books and authorities. He writes in the preface, "I have not kept one undertaking that allured me merely by the caprice of others, and have valued no man's judgment of me so much as my own."(Montaigne, Preface) This quote demonstrates Montaigne's emphasis on personal experience and decision-making. As a result, Montaigne focuses on personal anecdotes throughout his essays, rather than referencing other authors or authorities.
In Chapter 31, "Of Anger," Montaigne writes about his personal experience with anger and how he has learned to control it. He writes, "I have naturally a brisk and active disposition; my desires get briskly inflamed, but they are soon cold again. The anger I display extinguishes itself; I have not leisure and persistence enough to keep it alive and boiling."(Montaigne, Of Anger) Montaigne's personal experience and reflections on anger support his belief in learning through experience rather than books and authorities. By providing an example from his life, he shows that his beliefs about human nature are grounded in his personal experiences.
Montaigne also believes in the idea of individual freedom and rejects societal conventions that restrict one's personal expression. He writes, "The world does not proceed by general and fixed laws; everything is subjective and a matter of opinion."(Montaigne, Preface) Montaigne's emphasis on individual freedom is evident in Chapter 24, "Of Pedantry." Montaigne argues that the traditional education system places excessive importance on rote memorization and neglects the development of individual creativity. He writes, "We subject ourselves to their tyranny because we cannot keep a watch on ourselves, and do not firmly enough govern our own actions."(Montaigne, Of Pedantry) In this chapter, Montaigne argues that the traditional education system restricts individual freedom and prevents personal development. By providing an example from his life, Montaigne demonstrates how societal conventions can limit personal expression.
Montaigne also believes in the importance of self-reflection and understanding oneself. In Chapter 1, "By Diverse Means We Arrive at the Same End," Montaigne argues that the pursuit of knowledge should ultimately lead to self-knowledge. He writes, "I am myself the matter of my book."(Montaigne, By Diverse Means We Arrive at the Same End) Montaigne's emphasis on self-reflection is also evident in Chapter 9, "Of Liars." He argues that people often lie to themselves, and in doing so, they do not understand their true selves. "We cannot trust our reasoning powers if we forget or neglect to use them."(Montaigne, Of Liars) Thus, Montaigne emphasizes the need for self-reflection as a way to understand oneself.
Lastly, Montaigne believes in the importance of embracing human imperfection and embracing one's flaws. He writes, "I would fain see those qualities in my own behavior that I condemn in others. Myself to judge myself, to borrow no authority, to follow no guide but my own. This my conscience tells me, that to esteem myself above my fellows, to value myself for being wiser or more virtuous than they, is a grievous crime."(Montaigne, Preface) In Chapter 3, "Of Repentance," Montaigne writes about the need to embrace our flaws and use them as an opportunity for growth. He writes, "We have no more occasion to accuse ourselves of the faults we have abolished in ourselves than of those of which we never were guilty."(Montaigne, Of Repentance) Montaigne encourages the reader to embrace their imperfections and instead of feeling guilty and ashamed, to use them as an opportunity for self-improvement.
In conclusion, Montaigne's preface sets the stage for the subsequent chapters and provides an understanding of the author's personal experiences, views, and beliefs. Montaigne believes in learning through experience rather than blindly following books and authorities. He emphasizes individual freedom and rebukes societal conventions that restrict personal expression. Montaigne also believes in the importance of self-reflection and accepting one's flaws. These beliefs are reflected throughout the essays and provide a framework for the reader to understand and analyze Montaigne's stories and reflections. By sharing his personal experiences and beliefs, Montaigne creates an intimate relationship with the reader, encouraging an emotional understanding of the human condition, and allowing the reader to connect and empathize with his stories on a more personal level.
