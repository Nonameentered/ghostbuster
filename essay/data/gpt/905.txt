The terms 'Developmental States' and 'Competition States' have been widely used to describe the distinctive approaches taken by East Asian countries in their quest for economic growth and development. The concept of the Developmental State refers to the belief that the role of the state is crucial in driving economic growth, while the Competition State refers to the idea that economic competition has become the driving force in shaping the economic policies of a state. Both are relevant concepts in East Asian countries, particularly in Singapore, Korea, and Japan, as they have employed different strategies in order to achieve economic successes. In the era of globalization, these states have transformed their pathways in response to the changing global economic forces, leading to a shift in the roles of state and society. This essay will analyze the relevance of these concepts in East Asian countries and the extent to which the roles of state and society have changed according to the challenges posed by global economic forces.
The Developmental State concept originated in the 1960s and 1970s, during the period of rapid economic growth in Japan. It is built on the premise that the government has a central role in ensuring economic development through a combination of economic planning, government-led industrialization, and heavy investment in human capital. The Developmental State approach emphasizes the importance of government intervention in nurturing key industries, supporting advanced technologies, and coordinating between different sectors. This approach is based on the idea that the government should create the needed conditions for the private sector to grow and expand, with targeted measures such as tax incentives and subsidies.
Korea and Singapore have been known to have adopted the Developmental State approach in their initial stages of economic development. In Singapore, the government implemented policies that focused on achieving competitiveness in a range of industries including manufacturing, biotechnology, and information technology. These policies were supported through government-led initiatives such as the provision of low-cost land, tax incentives, and intensive infrastructure development. In Korea, the government played a critical role in nurturing industries such as shipbuilding and steel production and providing support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
However, as East Asian countries experienced rapid economic growth and development, the global economic landscape changed. With the rise of neoliberalism, competition between states became an essential feature of the global economy. This forced East Asian countries to change their approach and adopt the competition state concept. In contrast to the developmental state approach, the competition state approach emphasizes the importance of creating a conducive environment for competition and innovation by facilitating market-oriented reforms, deregulation, and privatization.
In the competition state approach, countries are expected to become more competitive in the global market by opening up their economies to foreign competition and investing in research and development to stay ahead of the game. This approach is centered on the idea of a 'level playing field' in which state intervention is limited, and the business community is free to innovate and find ways to succeed in the global market. It posits that successful states will be those that are able to adapt to the global economic environment and facilitate the growth of globally competitive industries.
Japan is one example of an East Asian country that has transitioned from a developmental to a competition state. The Japanese government established a specific set of policy guidelines to facilitate the transition, which included the deregulation of industries such as retail, transportation, and telecommunications, the promotion of foreign direct investment (FDI), the development of a dynamic service sector, and the encouragement of entrepreneurship. Similarly, in South Korea, the government initiated policies that promoted foreign trade, opened up the domestic market and encouraged the presence of foreign investors.
However, the concept of the competition state has also attracted significant criticism. Critics claim that the approach undermines social and environmental protections, leads to income inequality, and results in the concentration of power in the hands of elites. Critics also argue that the competition state approach can lead to the erosion of the welfare state and the transfer of power from government to the private sector.
Singapore exemplifies the weaknesses of the competition state concept. Although Singapore has been successful in implementing market-oriented policies to promote a competitive environment, social protections are relatively weak. This means that low-skilled workers are often left behind, and wages are kept low. Additionally, the concentration of power in the hands of elites and the close relationship between the state and business have resulted in concerns about accountability and transparency.
Despite the criticisms of the competition state approach, East Asian countries continue to transform their pathways in response to global economic changes. In Korea, the government has developed policies that combine elements of both the developmental and competition state approaches. In recent years, Korea has pursued economic policies that emphasized the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), while also promoting innovation and entrepreneurship.
In Japan, the government has recently shifted its attention back to developmental state policies due to increasing concerns about the country's future economic prospects. The Japanese government has recently adopted a 'new growth strategy' which includes policies aimed at developing new industries, encouraging innovation, and investing in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and renewable energy.
In conclusion, East Asian countries have employed different strategies in their quest for economic growth and development. The Developmental State and Competition State concepts have been useful in explaining the different approaches taken, and how these have transformed over time in response to global economic changes. While the competition state approach has been criticized for its potential negative consequences, East Asian countries continue to evolve and adapt their economic strategies to address the challenges of globalization. These new strategies will likely continue to reflect a combination of developmental and competition state policies designed to promote growth and innovation, while also taking into account the wider social consequences of these policies.
