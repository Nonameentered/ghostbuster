The problem of evil has long been a source of theological debate, particularly among adherents of classical theism. At its core, the problem of evil asks how a God who is omnipotent, omniscient, and omni-benevolent could allow evil to exist in the world. Critics argue that the existence of evil is incompatible with the notion of a perfectly good and all-powerful deity, leading some to question the existence of the God of Classical Theism altogether.
There have been many theodicies proposed throughout history to address the problem of evil, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this essay, I will examine several of these theodicies and evaluate their effectiveness in addressing the challenges posed by the problem of evil. Ultimately, I will argue that the reality of evil makes it impossible for the God of Classical Theism to exist as traditionally conceived.
Before delving into the theodicies offered in response to the problem of evil, it is necessary to briefly examine the nature of Classical Theism. Classical Theism is a philosophical and theological view of God that emphasizes divine simplicity, immutability, and perfection. It holds that God is the ultimate reality, the creator and sustainer of all things, and is characterized by attributes such as omnipotence (all-powerful), omniscience (all-knowing), and omni-benevolence (all-good). The problem of evil challenges the compatibility of these attributes with the existence of evil in the world.
One theodicy that has been proposed in response to the problem of evil is the free-will defense. This theodicy asserts that God created humans with free will, which allows us to make choices that can either result in good or evil. The existence of evil in the world is not a product of God's will but rather the result of human beings using their free will to do evil things. According to this theodicy, God cannot be held responsible for the existence of evil because it is not something that he directly caused or desired.
There are several strengths to the free-will defense. Firstly, it provides an explanation for the existence of evil in the world that is compatible with the idea of an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good God. It acknowledges that the existence of evil is not something that God directly caused or desired but rather a result of human choices. Secondly, the free-will defense is consistent with the idea that God created humans in his image, allowing us to have freedom of choice, which is seen as an important part of what it means to be human.
However, the free-will defense also has several weaknesses. Critics argue that it fails to account for natural evil, such as earthquakes or diseases, which do not seem to be the result of human choices. Additionally, some have raised the objection that God could have created humans with free will but ensured that they would always choose to do good. If God is all-powerful, then surely it is within his power to create beings who always freely choose to do good.
Another theodicy that has been proposed in response to the problem of evil is the soul-building or character-building defense. This theodicy suggests that God allows evil to exist in the world in order to help humans develop morally and spiritually. The challenges presented by suffering and evil in the world provide an opportunity for humans to grow in ways that would not be possible otherwise.
One strength of the soul-building defense is that it provides a possible explanation for the existence of evil that is compatible with an all-good, all-knowing, and all-powerful God. Additionally, it acknowledges that the existence of evil can have a positive effect on human development and character.
However, this theodicy also has several weaknesses. Firstly, critics argue that the idea that God would allow evil to exist just to help humans become better people seems to be at odds with the idea of God as all-powerful. If God is all-powerful, why would he need to use evil to achieve his goals? Additionally, some have pointed out that the soul-building defense seems to suggest that it would be better for humans to experience evil and suffering rather than live a life free from those things. This seems to be a morally problematic claim.
A third theodicy is the best-of-all-possible-worlds defense, which holds that this world is the best of all possible worlds and that God, being all-good, would only create the best possible world. According to this theodicy, even though evil and suffering exist in the world, this is still the best of all possible worlds.
One strength of the best-of-all-possible-worlds defense is that it acknowledges the existence of evil while claiming that the world is still good and that God could not have done better. Additionally, it avoids the moral problem of suggesting that God could have created a world without any evil but chose not to. Furthermore, it acknowledges that evil and suffering could serve some ultimate good.
However, this theodicy also has several weaknesses. Firstly, the claim that this is the best of all possible worlds is difficult to reconcile with the existence of evil. Even if this is the best world possible, it still seems difficult to claim that it is overall good given the existence of evil. Additionally, the idea of a best-of-all-possible-worlds is based on a concept of perfection that may be impossible to achieve and makes arbitrary standards. Lastly, it does not provide a satisfactory moral justification for the existence of natural evil such as volcanic eruptions and tsunamis.
Despite the strengths of these and other theodicies, the reality of evil still presents a significant challenge to the existence of the God of Classical Theism. If God is all-powerful, why would he allow evil to exist? If God is all-knowing, why didn't he prevent evil from happening? And if God is all-good, why would he allow evil to exist at all? These questions highlight the tension that exists between the attributes traditionally ascribed to God and the existence of evil in the world.
The problem of evil also challenges the idea of divine sovereignty. If God is all-powerful, there seems to be no good reason why he would not prevent evil. On the other hand, if human free will is the cause of evil, then God may not be in complete control of the world, which would challenge the view of God as sovereign.
Furthermore, human suffering can be seen as an argument against the existence of an all-loving God. If God truly loved us in the way that is traditionally depicted, then he would not allow us to experience suffering and pain. The existence of natural disasters and pandemics also puts God's benevolence into question. If God truly wanted to prevent suffering, he would have done something to prevent such disasters from happening.
In conclusion, the problem of evil presents a significant challenge to the existence of the God of Classical Theism. While theodicies such as the free-will defense, the soul-building defense, and the best-of-all-possible-worlds defense offer possible explanations for the existence of evil in the world, they also have significant weaknesses. Ultimately, the reality of evil makes it impossible to reconcile a God who is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good with the existence of evil in the world. If evil cannot be reconciled with such a God, then the existence of the God of Classical Theism must be called into question.
