During a physical exam for dysphagia, several observations may be made that warrant further investigation. Dysphagia refers to difficulty in swallowing, and during a physical exam for this condition, a doctor may observe several signs that suggest the presence of this condition.
Firstly, the doctor may note that the patient has difficulty initiating a swallow or that they are coughing and choking while swallowing. They may also observe that food or fluid is coming back up out of the mouth or nose, suggesting that the patient is not able to keep it down. This could also suggest the possibility of aspiration, or food and fluids entering the lungs instead of the stomach due to improper swallowing.
Additionally, the doctor may observe that the patient has a hoarse or weak voice, suggesting that the muscles used for swallowing and speaking are weak. The patient may also have drooling or problems with oral hygiene, suggesting that food and fluids are not being swallowed properly and are accumulating in the mouth.
Overall, a physical exam for dysphagia may reveal several signs that suggest difficulty with swallowing. These observations can inform further investigations, such as a swallowing study or a referral to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment.
