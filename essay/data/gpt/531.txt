Introduction:
Personal computer keyboards have come a long way since their inception in the 1960s. Today, many people spend hours in front of their computer typing continuously. For some, this can lead to repetitive strain injuries, discomfort, and even long-term health problems. The ergonomic keyboard is a solution to this problem as it is designed to reduce the discomfort felt by users and prevent long-term health problems.
PCD Maltron is one of the leading companies that produce ergonomic keyboards. Despite having a good reputation, they are facing some issues that are hindering their progress. This essay will discuss the main issues faced by PCD Maltron, how they can address these issues and improve their position within the market. Moreover, it will elaborate on the current state and potential growth of the ergonomic keyboard market, the barriers to entry for new competitors, how the needs of end-users and businesses differ, and the decision-making process for businesses to purchase new ergonomic equipment.
Main Issues Faced By PCD Maltron:
One of the main issues faced by PCD Maltron is the fact that their products are relatively expensive compared to regular keyboards. Ergonomic keyboards have more features, require more significant research and development, and have a smaller market, which all contribute to their higher cost. The high price of PCD Maltron products is thought to be a limiting factor in their growth.
Another challenge that PCD Maltron faces is the fact that they do not have any significant online presence. For a company in the digital age, it is a disadvantage as the majority of consumers research and purchase products online. Due to lack of online presence, PCD Maltron loses out on a substantial percentage of potential customers. Moreover, they also don't have a robust digital marketing strategy.
PCD Maltron is a small company compared to their competition. Hence, they suffer from limited resources to invest in research and development, marketing and advertising efforts, and producing ergonomic keyboards in large quantities. As a result, they can't compete with larger companies that have access to more financial resources, which puts them at a disadvantage regarding market penetration.
Ways to Address the Issues Faced By PCD Maltron:
One way PCD Maltron could address the high cost of their products is by developing a more robust pricing strategy that provides more value to customers while maintaining profitability. For example, they could reduce the number of features offered on their keyboards to minimize R&D costs. Additionally, they could research materials and production methods that may provide cost savings.
To address their limited online presence, PCD Maltron could hire specialists in digital marketing and SEO (Search Engine Optimization), experts who can help them create a user-friendly website with an e-commerce section. Besides, PCD Maltron could invest in social media marketing, as it offers a low-cost, high-impact way of reaching potential customers.
PCD Maltron could also look to expand their distribution channels to sell through third-party marketplaces and retailers. Such an approach could increase their visibility and customer base. Furthermore, PCD Maltron could consider joint ventures with larger companies, gaining access to their marketing, distribution, and financial resources.
Current State and Potential Growth of the Ergonomic Keyboard Market:
The ergonomic keyboard industry has seen significant growth in recent years due to the increasing awareness among employees and employers regarding the importance of ergonomics at work. The annual growth rate in the ergonomic keyboard market is projected to be around 3.5%, with a market valuation of around $1.5 billion by 2024.
The market is highly diversified, with different keyboard types, sizes, and functionalities catering to specific needs of consumers. Key players in the ergonomic keyboard market include Logitech, Microsoft, and Kinesis, among others. However, there is space for new entrants in the market, and the demand for more innovative and ergonomic designs will continue to grow.
Barriers to Entry for New Competitors:
While the ergonomic keyboard market is growing, it can be challenging for new competitors to enter. One of the significant barriers to entry is the high cost of research and development required to create innovative designs. Additionally, new entrants will have to compete with established companies with well-developed distribution channels, brand recognition, and marketing capability.
Another significant barrier to entry is the high cost of certifications required to assure product safety and ergonomic compliance. Subsequently, new entrants may have to invest a significant amount of money, time and resources to obtain the necessary certifications.
Differences Between the Needs of End-Users and Businesses:
The needs of end-users and businesses often differ regarding ergonomic keyboards. End-users appreciate keyboards that are intuitive, easy to use, and customized to their needs. They are looking for keyboards that are comfortable, prevent long-term health issues, and have additional features like backlight or multimedia keys.
On the other hand, businesses prioritize factors such as cost, productivity, durability, and compatibility with existing IT infrastructure. Therefore, businesses need to invest in tools that contribute to health, operation, efficiency, and employee retention, observing the bottom line.
Decision-Making Process for Businesses to Purchase New Ergonomic Equipment:
The decision-making process for purchasing ergonomic keyboards in businesses usually involves several decision-makers. It involves the IT department, management, and the employee themselves. The IT department will typically look for compatible keyboards with the existing infrastructure, whereas management will prioritize keyboards that are efficient and cost-effective. In contrast, employees will focus on keyboards that are comfortable and minimize the risk of injury.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the ergonomic keyboard market has become increasingly critical in promoting employee health and boosting productivity. PCD Maltron, being one of the leading companies in this market, faces significant challenges that inhibit their growth; however, their potential growth opportunities in the market warrant their efforts to stay competitive. Through addressing their challenges through product strategy, digital marketing, and business expansion, PCD Maltron can position itself to make significant inroads into the ergonomic keyboard market. Meanwhile, new entrants to the market face significant barriers to entry, including hefty research and development costs and a competitive marketplace, even if the market continues to grow.
