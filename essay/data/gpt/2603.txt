Good nutrition is essential in the maintenance of good health, and nutrition students need to set an example for the general public regarding healthy eating habits. However, studies have shown that even nutrition students are not immune to nutritional deficiencies in their diets. In 2006, an assessment of the nutritional intake of nutrition students was conducted to identify the nutritional deficiencies found in their diets and how they compared to recommended nutrient intake levels.
The study found that the most common nutritional deficiencies among nutrition students were inadequate intake of vitamins D, E, and C, calcium, magnesium, and fiber. The reason for these inadequacies was attributed to the fact that many nutrition students followed a typical Western-type diet, which is high in refined carbohydrates, unhealthy fats, and low in nutrient-dense foods.
Vitamin D is a crucial vitamin that aids in the absorption of calcium and phosphorus, which are essential for the growth and maintenance of strong bones. The recommended nutrient intake level for vitamin D is 600 to 800 International Units (IU) for adults. However, the study found that most nutrition students consumed less than the recommended amount of vitamin D. The reason for this was attributed to a lack of exposure to sunlight, which is the main source of vitamin D. Additionally, vitamin D is found in foods such as fortified milk, fatty fish, and egg yolks, which are not commonly consumed by nutrition students.
Another vitamin that nutrition students are deficient in is vitamin E. Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that scavenges free radicals that can damage cells and cause chronic diseases such as cancer. The recommended daily intake of vitamin E is 15 milligrams for adults. However, the study found that most nutrition students consumed less than half the recommended amount. The reason for this was attributed to a lack of consumption of plant-based oils such as sunflower, safflower, and soybean oil, which are rich sources of vitamin E.
Vitamin C is another vitamin that is deficient in the diets of nutrition students. Vitamin C is essential for the formation of collagen, which is a structural protein that is found in the skin, bones, and connective tissues. The recommended intake level for vitamin C is 75 milligrams for women and 90 milligrams for men. However, the study found that most nutrition students consumed less than the recommended amount of vitamin C. The reason for this was attributed to a lack of consumption of fruits and vegetables, which are rich sources of vitamin C.
Calcium and magnesium are essential minerals that are required for strong bones and muscles. The recommended daily intake of calcium for adults is 1000 milligrams, and the recommended intake of magnesium is 400 milligrams for men and 310 milligrams for women. However, the study found that most nutrition students consumed less than the recommended amount of calcium and magnesium. The reason for this was attributed to a lack of consumption of dairy products, which are the primary source of calcium, and a lack of consumption of whole-grain products, nuts, and vegetables, which are rich sources of magnesium.
Lastly, nutrition students were found to be deficient in fiber. Fiber is a crucial nutrient that aids in the maintenance of digestive health and helps regulate blood sugar levels. The recommended intake level for fiber is 20 to 30 grams per day. However, the study found that most nutrition students consumed less than the recommended amount of fiber. The reason for this was attributed to a lack of consumption of whole-grains, fruits, and vegetables.
In conclusion, the study conducted in 2006 found that nutrition students were deficient in several essential nutrients such as vitamins D, E, and C, calcium, magnesium, and fiber. The deficiencies were attributed to a lack of consumption of nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy products. To ensure optimal health and wellbeing, nutrition students must practice what they preach and follow a nutrient-dense and well-balanced diet that is rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber. By doing so, they will be a role model to the general public and help reduce the prevalence of chronic diseases caused by unhealthy eating habits.
