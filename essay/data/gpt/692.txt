The Orchestrating Knowledge and the Process, Power, and Change images are two powerful tools that help businesses to understand the dynamics of strategy development, especially in cases of uncertainty and ambiguity such as the one presented in the BA case by Sullivan-Taylor. Despite their different perspectives, both these images highlight the usefulness of an emergent type of strategy.
The Orchestrating Knowledge image views business strategy as a dynamic and iterative process that involves continuous learning, experimentation, and revision. This image recognizes that business environments are constantly changing, and that organizations must develop strategies that can adapt to these changes. Similarly, the Process, Power, and Change image highlights the importance of organizational dynamics in shaping strategy. This image recognizes that power relations within and outside the organization can exert a significant influence on strategy development.
Both these images recognize the usefulness of an emergent type of strategy, which emphasizes flexibility, experimentation, and learning in response to changes in the external environment. In the BA case, the company faced significant challenges due to changing market conditions, regulatory challenges, and changing customer preferences. An emergent type of strategy allowed BA to experiment with different options, learn from its mistakes, and ultimately develop a successful strategy that involved significant changes in its operations and business model.
In conclusion, the Orchestrating Knowledge and the Process, Power, and Change images share some similarities in their perspective on strategy development. Both these images recognize the importance of organizational dynamics, continuous learning, and experimentation. They also recognize the usefulness of an emergent type of strategy, which emphasizes flexibility and agility in response to changes in the external environment. For businesses operating in uncertain and ambiguous conditions, these images offer valuable insights into how they can develop effective strategies that can adapt and thrive in changing conditions.
