Ortho-directed palladation is the process by which a palladium catalyst directs the substitution of an aromatic ring at the ortho position, or the two adjacent positions, to a functional group. This process is significant in the formation of aryl-palladium complexes, which have important applications in organic synthesis. The ortho position is preferred in palladation reactions due to steric and electronic factors, which make it the most accessible site for palladium coordination. This process is widely used in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. The development of ortho-directed palladation has greatly expanded the range of chemical transformations available to synthetic organic chemists, making it an essential tool in modern organic chemistry.
