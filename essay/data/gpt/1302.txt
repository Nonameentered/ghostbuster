High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is a widely used analytical method for separating, identifying, and quantifying compounds from a mixture of chemical compounds. HPLC is a liquid chromatography technique that relies on the principle of separation to separate the components of a mixture based on their physical and chemical properties. HPLC can be used for the analysis of organic, inorganic, and bio-molecules.
Principles Behind HPLC
The principle behind HPLC is based upon the composition of a mixture to be separated. The separation of compounds depends on their physicochemical properties, such as their size, charge, polarity, solubility, etc. The separation technique relies on the use of the stationary phase, which is packed inside a column, and the mobile phase, which flows through this column. A sample is injected into this column utilizing a sample injector. After some time, the individual components of the mixture separate based on their affinity for the stationary phase.
Different Methods of Chromatography
There are various types of chromatography techniques based on the physical and chemical properties of the substances being analyzed. HPLC, Gas Chromatography (GC), and Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) are the most commonly used chromatography techniques in the field of chemical analysis. In HPLC, a liquid is used as the mobile phase, while in GC, a gas is used as the mobile phase. TLC is a separation technique used for the identification and purification of organic compounds.
Models of Retention
The retention model in HPLC is based upon Henry's law of physical equilibrium. The rate of retention depends on the stationary phase, the mobile phase, and the sample. The sample interacts with the stationary phase based on its affinity, and the mobile phase washes it away. In the reverse-phase HPLC, a hydrophobic stationary phase interacts with hydrophobic molecules, while in the normal-phase HPLC, a polar stationary phase interacts with polar molecules.
Advantages and Disadvantages of HPLC
HPLC provides high resolution, accuracy, and precision. It can detect compounds at a lower limit of detection and quantify small amounts of analytes. HPLC can be used to analyze various kinds of compounds, including proteins, amino acids, lipids, sugars, vitamins, and nucleotides. 
However, HPLC requires skilled operators, expensive equipment, and a specialized laboratory. The samples have to be dissolved in the mobile phase, which can lead to impurities and contamination. The chromatography column has a limited life span, and column replacement can be costly.
Examples of How HPLC Can Be Used in Analytical Chemistry
HPLC is used in many areas of analytical chemistry, including drug development, forensic science, environmental monitoring, and biochemistry. In drug development, HPLC is used to analyze drugs and their metabolites in biological fluids, monitor their stability, and test the dissolution of drug formulations. In forensic science, HPLC is used in toxicology to detect and identify drugs, poisons, and other toxic compounds in biological samples. In environmental monitoring, HPLC is used to analyze the quality of water, air, and soil for contaminants. In biochemistry, HPLC is used to analyze the composition of proteins, peptides, and other macromolecules.
Detection of Impurities
HPLC can be used to detect impurities in a sample. In the pharmaceutical industry, impurities may arise during the synthesis of a drug, storage, or transportation. Some impurities may affect the potency, safety, and quality of the drug. HPLC can separate the impurities from the active ingredients by column chromatography. The impurities are then analyzed by mass spectrometry, UV detection, or fluorescence detection.
Monitoring the Progress of a Reaction
HPLC can also be used to monitor the progress of a reaction during synthesis. The product and the reactants can be analyzed using HPLC. The product can be separated from the reactants based on their polarity and size. The yield of the product can be calculated by integrating the area under the curve of the product peak. The amount of starting material can also be quantified.
