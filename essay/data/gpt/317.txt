Introduction
Industrial action is an important part of workers' rights as it allows them to act collectively and make changes in their workplace environment. In Britain, the law on industrial action has been a topic of debate for years, especially in terms of the right to strike and the right to secondary action. The Gate Gourmet dispute provides a case study on the need for industrial action reform. This essay evaluates the case for reforming Britain's law on industrial action in light of the Gate Gourmet dispute.
The Gate Gourmet Dispute
In 2005, the catering company Gate Gourmet dismissed about 800 workers without notice, and the workforce responded with unofficial strike action. This resulted in British Airways grounding all of its flights for two days, making it the largest industrial dispute in the aviation industry in over a decade.
The Gate Gourmet dispute highlights the issue of the right to secondary action. Secondary action refers to a strike or boycott where the workers are not directly employed by the company with whom they are taking action against. The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1992 (TULRA) severely restricts the right to secondary action, making it illegal in the majority of cases. However, the Gate Gourmet dispute sparked debate over whether the current law is sufficient, as many felt that the restrictions on secondary action prevented workers from effectively protesting.
Arguments for Reform
The Gate Gourmet dispute highlights the need for reform in two key areas; the right to strike and the right to secondary action. Firstly, the right to strike is a vital part of workers' rights. However, some argue that the current law on strike action in Britain is too restrictive, making it difficult for workers to take action. Under the Trade Union Act 2016, for example, strike action is only legal if the union has a 50% turnout threshold in the vote, with public sector workers also needing an additional 40% support threshold. Such restrictions are too high and limit workers' ability to take effective action. Therefore, reform is necessary to make it easier for workers to go on strike and take collective action.
Secondly, the Gate Gourmet dispute highlights the issue of secondary action. The current law makes secondary action illegal in most cases under TULRA, preventing workers from effectively protesting. This is problematic as it limits the power of unions and hampers workers' ability to take action on issues affecting their employment. Therefore, reform is needed to allow for legal secondary action where appropriate.
Arguments Against Reform
Despite the clear need for reform, some argue that the law on industrial action is sufficient as it is. Supporters of the current law suggest that there must be limitations on industrial action, otherwise, it would be too easy for workers to disrupt essential services and harm the economy. Furthermore, some believe that unions already have too much power, and any relaxation of the law would only serve to reinforce that power.
However, these arguments do not adequately address the need for reform. The right to strike and the right to protest are fundamental human rights, and without them, workers' voices will be silenced. It is essential that we strike a balance between workers' rights and the needs of employers and society as a whole.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the Gate Gourmet dispute highlights the need for reform in Britain's law on industrial action. The current law restricts the ability of workers to take effective collective action, which is essential for ensuring fair employment practices. Reforms are necessary to enable workers to go on strike easily and legally and allow for legal secondary action when necessary. While there are arguments against reform, the fundamental right to protest must be balanced with the needs of employers and society as a whole. Therefore, concrete steps must be taken to reform the law to ensure that workers in Britain have the necessary tools to demand fair working conditions and ensure that their voices are heard.
