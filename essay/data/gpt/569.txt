In their book "Restoring Our Competitive Edge: Competing Through Manufacturing," Hayes and Wheelwright have outlined ten decision areas that can guide the formulation of a successful manufacturing strategy. These ten decision areas include: manufacturing vision and objectives, plant capacity, vertical integration, production flexibility, make or buy decisions, process technology, production planning and control, work-force management, quality control, and performance metrics. By considering each of these areas, a manufacturing strategy can be developed that is effective, efficient, and competitive in the market.
Dividing the overall project into three sub-projects- education, layout transformation, and six sigma- can contribute to the successful implementation of the manufacturing strategy. By appointing senior executives and project managers to oversee each project, clear responsibilities and expectations can be defined. Education on lean manufacturing principles and guidelines can enhance the knowledge and understanding of the workforce. Layout transformation can optimize the use of space and resources to ensure efficient production. Six sigma methodology can be applied to improve the quality and productivity of the manufacturing processes.
Overall, the successful implementation of a manufacturing strategy requires careful consideration of the ten decision areas outlined by Hayes and Wheelwright. Dividing the project into sub-projects and appointing senior executives and project managers can help to ensure that the implementation process is well organized and communicated. By focusing on these areas, a new body shop manufacturing company can achieve lean manufacturing and compete successfully in the market.
