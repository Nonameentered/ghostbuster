The end of the Cold War was a watershed moment in world politics, marking a new era of American power and global order. In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States emerged as the world's sole superpower, with unprecedented military, economic, and cultural influence. This new position of unipolarity raised important questions about the link between theory and policy in shaping American power projection and global governance, and the role of realism and liberalism in defining the legitimacy and efficacy of American leadership in the post-Cold War world.
The realist perspective on American power sees world politics as a struggle for power and security among nation-states, driven by the anarchic structure of the international system. According to realists, states have a natural interest in maximizing their power and protecting their security, and must engage in a Machiavellian calculus of self-interest to survive in a competitive environment. Realism views the exercise of American power as a necessary means of protecting its national interests and managing the balance of power in the world, and emphasizes the importance of military strength, alliances, and deterrence in achieving these goals. In the post-Cold War era, realists argue that American power should be used to contain potential challengers, such as China, Russia, or Iran, and prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This approach implies a willingness to use force, if necessary, to maintain American dominance and security.
In contrast, the liberal perspective on American power emphasizes the importance of international institutions, cooperation, and the rule of law in promoting global stability and prosperity. According to liberals, the anarchic nature of the international system can be offset by the establishment of multilateral mechanisms of governance, such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, or the International Criminal Court. Liberals see international cooperation and diplomacy as the best means of solving global problems, such as poverty, terrorism, or climate change, and view the use of force as a last resort, to be authorized by multilateral bodies and justified on humanitarian grounds. In the post-Cold War era, liberals argue that American power should be used to promote democracy, human rights, and free markets around the world, and to support multilateral efforts to address global challenges. This approach implies a commitment to international law and human rights, and a willingness to share power with other states and stakeholders.
The debate between realism and liberalism has important implications for the legitimacy and efficacy of American power in establishing global order. Critics of realism argue that it leads to a self-defeating cycle of conflict, as states pursue power at the expense of others and undermine the stability of the system. Realism is accused of promoting a narrow and short-sighted conception of national interest, neglecting the benefits of cooperation and the costs of conflict. Realists are also criticized for their unilateral and militaristic approach to international issues, which can alienate allies, violate human rights, and create blowbacks of terrorism and extremism. Realism is seen as a recipe for confrontation, rather than cooperation, and inconsistent with the emerging norms of global governance.
Critics of liberalism, on the other hand, argue that it is idealistic and na√Øve, neglecting the harsh realities of power politics and the interests of other states. Liberals are accused of overestimating the ability of international institutions to solve complex problems and of ignoring the role of power and self-interest in shaping outcomes. Liberals are also criticized for their selective and prejudiced approach to democracy and human rights, which can be used to justify intervention and regime change in some cases, while ignoring abuses in others. Liberals are seen as promoting a universalistic and Western-centric vision of the world, inconsistent with the diversity and complexity of global society.
Overall, the link between theory and policy in relation to American power in the aftermath of the Cold War depends on the interplay between domestic and international factors, and the changing nature of global challenges. While both realism and liberalism have strengths and weaknesses, they are not mutually exclusive or deterministic, but rather reflect different perspectives on the complex and evolving global order. The limitations of the realist interpretation of American power lie in its neglect of the importance of soft power, legitimacy, and social capital in achieving long-term stability and prosperity, and its tendency to view the world as a zero-sum game. The role played by domestic and international factors in shaping states' definitions of their interests is critical to understanding the link between theory and policy, and the balance between self-interest and cooperation in global governance.
In conclusion, the debate between realism and liberalism in relation to American power in the aftermath of the Cold War reflects the fundamental tensions between power and norms in global politics. While both perspectives offer valuable insights into the challenges of managing a complex and evolving global system, neither provides a complete or definitive answer to the question of how to establish a just and prosperous world order. The link between theory and policy depends on the ability of states to balance their national interests and shared values, and to engage in constructive dialogue and cooperation with other actors in the global community.
