In his historical work, the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides describes the Athenian plague that ravaged Athens in 430 BCE. He not only provides a vivid description of the symptoms but also sought to understand its causes and offer possible cures. Thucydides' account of the Athenian plague, in many ways, resembles the work of the Greek physician Hippocratic theories. In this essay, we will explore the depiction of the Athenian plague by Thucydides in the context of Hippocratic theories.
Thucydides' account of the Athenian plague begins with an eerie description of how the disease broke out. He identified the plague as originating from Ethiopia and spreading through Egypt and Libya to Athens. The symptoms of the plague include high fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and respiratory distress, which eventually led to severe dehydration and death. In his depiction of the plague, Thucydides provides a grim image of the scope of human suffering during the pandemic. The dead were piled on top of each other, and the living had to witness their loved ones die without being able to do anything about it. The plague hit the Athenian population hard, killing both the young and the old.
Thucydides sought to understand the cause of the plague. He provided an explanation for how the plague broke out, as he believed that it was caused by a change in the environment. During the summer of 430 BCE, Athens experienced a severe drought. The lack of rain meant that the food supply was scarce, and people were forced to scavenge for food. This, in turn, led to poor hygiene conditions, with people crowding together in unsanitary conditions. The high population density and poor living conditions favored the spread of disease. Thucydides believed that the cause of the plague was a combination of environmental factors and the poor living conditions in Athens.
In seeking a cure for the Athenian plague, Thucydidesâ€™ description of the disease, as well as his analysis of its causes, overlaps with the Hippocratic theories. Hippocratic physicians believed that disease was not a punishment from the gods or caused by supernatural forces, but rather due to natural causes. The human body was seen as a system, whereby balance was essential for good health. A lack of balance represented a disruption in the system, and hence a source of disease.
The Hippocratic corpus consists of several medical works, which include theories and treatments for various diseases. The works explain many of the diseases that affected the Greeks, including the plague. According to the works, the plague was believed to have been caused by an imbalance between the four humors: blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. The imbalance led to an excess of one of the humors, causing symptoms such as fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.
The Hippocratic theories were applied in practice to cure diseases. One of the treatments used for the plague was the concept of contraries. Contrary treatments aimed to adjust or balance the humors by using the opposite. For instance, if the patient had a high fever, the practitioner would prescribe cooling herbs or substances to reduce the body temperature.
Thucydides mentions how the Athenians tried to cure the plague through a combination of medical treatments and prayer. He explained that some of the medical treatments included physical remedies, such as purging the body, which was a common treatment for an excess of black bile. There were also spiritual cures, such as prayers to the gods and sacrifices. However, Thucydides explains that these cures were insufficient, and many died due to a lack of effective treatment.
In conclusion, Thucydides' depiction of the Athenian plague and Hippocratic theories correspond in several ways. Both saw the human body as a system that needed balance to maintain good health, and both aimed to reveal the natural causes of diseases. In the case of the plague, Thucydides identified the disease's cause as a result of environmental factors and poor living conditions. The treatments applied to the plague outbreak, which Thucydides describes, draw on Hippocratic theories, particularly the application of contraries for balancing the humors. Overall, both Thucydides and Hippocratic theories provide an insightful and important understanding of the Athenian plague.
