Costing methods hold a prominent position in the world of accounting and decision-making, particularly when it comes to the determination of operating profits. Marginal costing and full costing are the two most popular costing methods, both of which are fundamentally different in their approach and application. This essay intends to highlight the significant differences between these two costing methods and how they can affect operating profits.
To begin with, the fundamental difference between marginal costing and full costing is that the former revolves around variable costs, while the latter incorporates all costs, including fixed costs. Marginal costing considers only the variable costs, such as direct material, direct labor, and variable overheads, ignoring the fixed costs incurred in production. The reasoning behind this is that variable costs are those costs that fluctuate with changes in the level of output and, therefore, directly impact sales and profitability. In contrast, full costing incorporates both variable and fixed costs, such as rent, mortgage payments, and salaries, to name a few.
In terms of operating profits, both costing methods can influence it differently. Marginal costing is useful in analyzing short-term profitability, while full costing tends to analyze long-term profitability. Because marginal costing focuses on variable costs, it helps determine the contribution margin and break-even point through calculating the difference between total revenues and variable costs. In contrast, full costing assigns all costs, fixed and variable, to the products produced, resulting in different reported operating profits.
When analyzing different scenarios, one could understand the impact of these costing methods on operating profits. For instance, a company might have a high proportion of fixed costs associated with a product with a high contribution margin. In such a case, full costing would report a higher operating profit than marginal costing. When fixed costs are low, marginal costing would result in a higher operating profit. Therefore, the adoption of either full costing or marginal costing is dependent on the complexity of production processes and how the cost of resources is related to production.
As to whether one method is better than the other, the answer rests on several factors, such as the type of business in operation, production processes, relevance, and management objectives. In recent times, marginal costing has become increasingly popular due to its simplicity, particularly in the way it determines variable costs' impact on profitability. On the other hand, full costing tends to provide more accurate and detailed profitability reports and is essential for decision-making. It is essential to note that full costs, including fixed costs, are incorporated in pricing decisions, while marginal costing may lead to underpricing decisions.
In conclusion, both marginal costing and full costing methods play an essential role in determining operating profits. However, they differ in their approach to costing decisions and impact on profits. Understanding the scenarios where each method could apply is critical in choosing which method to apply. Although different businesses might find one method better than the other due to their respective management objectives, choosing either method's appropriate use depends on the type of business operation and the desired level of management decision-making.
