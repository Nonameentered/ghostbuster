Archaeology and anthropology are two fields that have a long-standing relationship. While anthropology deals with the study of human behavior, culture, and society, archaeology focuses on the material remains of the past. They are both vital for understanding the development of human cultures and societies, examining the connections between the past and the present. Many anthropologists, in fact, are also archaeologists trained to retrieve and analyze ancient artifacts.
The main difference between archaeology and anthropology lies in their respective focus on material and socio-cultural aspects of human life. Anthropology seeks an understanding of the social and cultural complexities of human societies. This discipline usually emphasizes ethnographic research, which involves interacting with and learning from people of different cultures. Anthropologists use various research methods such as participant observation, interviews, and surveys to study human cultures and social structures. These methods enable anthropologists to collect data on social behaviors and cultural beliefs.
Archaeology, on the other hand, primarily focuses on material remains of the past- objects, structures, and features. This discipline studies ancient artifacts and ecofacts, such as bones or natural materials that have survived from past cultures. Archaeologists use scientific methods to analyze and interpret these remains. For example, they may conduct carbon dating tests or analyze the chemical compositions of bones or pottery for evidence of ancient diet or trade routes. Archaeology offers a window into the past, providing important information about the daily lives, beliefs, and technologies of the people who once lived in the past.
The relationship between archaeology and anthropology is deeply intertwined, as both fields deal with different aspects of the study of human societies and cultures. This integration allows for a comprehensive exploration of human history and culture. Anthropology has influenced archaeology in several ways, leading to new approaches and methods in the study of the past. As anthropologists have moved beyond the study of communities or traditional societies, their unique methods have influenced archaeology in several distinct regards. 
One particular area where anthropology has significantly influenced archaeology is in the study of exchange systems. Exchange systems play a vital role in human societies, facilitating trade, sharing, and redistribution of goods and services. Anthropology provides frameworks for analyzing exchange systems, and archaeology provides the materials for testing these frameworks at different times and places across human history. The study of exchange systems is a crucial area of inquiry where anthropology and archaeology intersect.
Anthropologists have developed theories to explain exchange systems that guide archaeologists in examining the material evidence of past structures and systems. One such theory is the concept of gift exchange. Marcel Mauss, a French sociologist, developed this concept in his book The Gift. According to Mauss, gift exchange involves an obligation for reciprocity between gift-givers and receivers. In other words, the gift-givers must reciprocate and issue gifts of a comparable value or kind at a later time.
This theory of gift exchange is essential for archaeologists to understand how societies of the past functioned. The exchange of goods played a significant role in the social structure of many ancient societies. By examining the artifacts that these societies left behind, archaeologists can make inferences about how gift exchange worked in practice and how goods and services were exchanged in a particular culture. These material records provide evidence of past exchange systems and thus, advance our understanding of the historical significance of such practices. 
One useful example for demonstrating how anthropology has influenced archaeology in exchange systems is the study of obsidian trade in the ancient world. Obsidian is a sharp volcanic rock that ancient people used to make cutting tools and weapons. Obsidian sources are scarce, meaning prehistoric cultures that used obsidian had to trade it across long distances to acquire it. International and regional trade routes facilitated this exchange of obsidian. Trade networks involved different kinds of exchange, such as direct trade, gift exchange, or tribute exchange.
Anthropology has a nuanced understanding of how these different kinds of exchange operate. Direct trade is a simple exchange that involves a direct transfer of goods without any other obligations. Gift exchange, as Mauss theorized, involved an element of reciprocity, where gifts were given to initiate or maintain social relationships between individuals or groups. Tribute exchange was another kind of material exchange, which gives tribute to a more extended network of rulers, typically to attain more significant political protection and security. Archaeologists, using data from excavations of sites along a trade route or geochemical analysis of the obsidian artifacts, can distinguish and identify formalized exchange systems. 
One example is the study of obsidian exchange systems that originated in the Valley of Mexico. These exchange networks connected many smaller societies. Archaeologists analyzing the obsidian materials found in excavations identified the sources of obsidian and the routes by which it spread across the ancient societies. Obsidian was brought in from a few areas in the Valley of Mexico to be distributed along two trade routes: the Mexican Plateau Route and the Pacific Coastal Route. 
These trade systems are characterized by reciprocal gift and tribute exchange to ensure safe passage through different territories along the routes. At each stop, small groups would exchange obsidian and other goods. These trades and gifts likely helped establish closer social relationships between these different communities. Due to the distances between the communities involved, exchange was an essential element of ensuring regular contact and exchanging of resources. The final artifacts found in one location enable archaeologists to trace trade routes and analyze the intensity and channels of exchange between different populations.
Anthropological theories about exchange bring a new perspective to understanding past societies. They offer archaeologists a framework for understanding social interactions and exchange systems in the past. Archaeologists can use theories of exchange and related social structures to interpret changes in society and to infer social organization, influences, and power relationships in a past era. By incorporating anthropological concepts into their work, archaeologists can draw more meaningful conclusions about past societies, which allow for a better understanding of the development of societies since ancient times.
In conclusion, the relationship between archaeology and anthropology is of great significance to the understanding of human history. Anthropology predominantly studies the sociocultural aspects of human society and provides researchers of the past with a theoretical context for investigating archaeological evidence. Anthropologists' influence on archaeology is evident in the use of frameworks for examining exchange systems, an important domain of study for both disciplines. Anthropologists' theories help archaeologists infer social structures and power relationships in the societies of the past and, therefore, contribute significantly to our understanding of the development of humankind. Archaeologists and anthropologists must work together to understand the past societies more comprehensively, to inform the present, and eventually ensure a better future for humanity.
