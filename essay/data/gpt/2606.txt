The apparatus used in the experiment was an eddy covariance system comprising several instruments, including a sonic anemometer, an infrared gas sensor, and two temperature sensors. The system measured the flux of energy, water vapor, and carbon dioxide within the atmospheric boundary layer.
Before the Intensive Observation Period, calibration of the instruments was done to ensure that accurate measurements were obtained. This involved checking the zero offset of the sensors and verifying the accuracy of the units. The instruments were also tested separately and checked for any noise in the data.
During the experiment, wind speed was measured using the sonic anemometer. The sonic anemometer measured wind by sending high-frequency sound waves between two transducers and measuring the time it took for the waves to travel from one transducer to the other. The data collected from the anemometer allowed for the calculation of the wind speed and direction.
The measurements obtained from the eddy covariance system were very accurate. The accuracy was demonstrated by the results observed from the graph of wind speed against ln(z), which showed a linear relationship. The graph was used to determine the roughness length and observed lapse rate near the surface.
The roughness length was a measure of the roughness of the surface the eddy covariance system was measuring. It was determined by carefully analyzing the data of the wind speed using the logarithmic law and calculating the slope of the graph of wind speed against ln(z). The observed lapse rate near the surface was determined by calculating the rate of decrease of temperature with an increase in height above the surface.
During the analysis of the experiment, several assumptions were made. One of the primary assumptions made was that the atmosphere was in a neutral state, which meant that there was no transfer of energy between the atmosphere layers. Non-neutral conditions affected the results because the heat transfer rate and wind speed varied with height.
The estimated value of sensible heat flux using the eddy correlation method and the profile method was related to the distance between the two temperature sensors. The eddy correlation method is typically more accurate than the profile method, but it requires a shorter distance between the two temperature sensors. The profile method, on the other hand, can measure vertical gradients of temperature over a greater distance.
In conclusion, the eddy covariance system is a powerful tool for studying the flux of energy, water vapor, and carbon dioxide within the atmospheric boundary layer. The accuracy of the measurements obtained from the system was very high, and the results demonstrated a linear relationship between wind speed and ln(z). The roughness length and observed lapse rate near the surface were also determined accurately. However, non-neutral conditions affected the results, and assumptions were made during the analysis of the experiment. The estimated value of sensible heat flux using the eddy correlation method and the profile method was related to the distance between the two temperature sensors. Overall, the eddy covariance system is an essential tool for weather and climate research.
