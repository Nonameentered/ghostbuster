The period of Reconstruction following the American Civil War was a time of significant change and upheaval. There were many aims of Presidential Reconstruction after the Civil War, including ensuring the stability and unity of the nation, providing for the safety and rights of former slaves, and restoring the rule of law in the Southern states. However, despite these aims, Reconstruction ultimately failed due to the policies of Presidents Lincoln and Johnson, the attitudes towards slaves and the Southern elite, and the role of Congress in the Reconstruction effort.
President Lincoln's aim during Reconstruction was to ensure the stability and unity of the Union. He sought to achieve this by issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared that all slaves in the Confederate states were to be freed. This was a significant step towards providing for the safety and rights of former slaves. He also sought to pardon Southern Confederate soldiers who pledged allegiance to the Union and allowed for the formation of new state governments that included African-American citizens. However, Lincoln's assassination in 1865 left his Reconstruction plans in the hands of his successor, Andrew Johnson.
President Johnson's policies during Reconstruction were more lenient towards the Southern states than Lincoln's. He believed that the states should be allowed to handle their own affairs and that it was not the federal government's place to dictate how the South was to be rebuilt. Johnson believed that to achieve this, the Southern states should be allowed to form their governments without pressure from the North. He also opposed any measures that would give African-Americans any real rights or power. Johnson's policies led to the re-ascendancy of the Southern planter elite, who actively worked against Reconstruction efforts.
The attitudes towards slaves and the Southern elite were integral to the failure of Presidential Reconstruction. The Southern elite, who had lost their power and influence after the end of the Civil War, were actively working against Reconstruction efforts. They were opposed to any measures that would give African-Americans any real rights or power, and actively sought to maintain the status quo. Additionally, the attitudes towards former slaves were also problematic. Although slavery had been abolished, many Southerners still viewed African-Americans as inferior and unworthy of basic human rights.
The role of Congress was also important in determining the success or failure of Reconstruction. Congress was responsible for passing the Reconstruction Acts, which laid out the guidelines for how the former Confederate states would be readmitted to the Union. These guidelines stipulated that the states needed to ratify the 14th and 15th Amendments, which granted citizenship and voting rights to African-Americans. However, the laws that were passed were incredibly weak, and the federal government did not provide the necessary funding or enforcement to ensure that these laws were followed. This led to a situation where Southern states were able to pass discriminatory laws that effectively prevented African-Americans from exercising their rights.
In conclusion, the aims of Presidential Reconstruction were noble, but ultimately failed due to the policies of Presidents Lincoln and Johnson, the attitudes towards slaves and the Southern elite, and the role of Congress in the Reconstruction effort. The lack of federal enforcement and funding meant that the rights of African-Americans were not protected, and the planter elite was able to reassert control over the South. The legacy of Reconstruction is still felt today, as much of the racial and political divisions in the United States can be traced back to this period in history.
