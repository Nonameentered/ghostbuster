British Steel was one of the largest steel companies in the world before their merge with Hoogovens in 2001 to form Corus. The macro and industrial environment surrounding British Steel during the 1990s was turbulent due to various factors, including changing consumer preferences and the rise of emerging markets, as well as government regulations that aimed to foster competitiveness in the steel industry. In this essay, we will discuss the macro and industrial environment surrounding British Steel before their merger in 2001 and how the company responded to the changing external environment. We will also examine how their strategic capabilities contributed to their successes and failures and the major challenges they faced during the merger with Hoogovens, as well as the impact of external environment and decisions made by the company on their major stakeholders.
During the 1990s, the steel industry in the UK was heavily regulated and dominated by state-owned companies, such as British Steel. However, with increasing international competition from emerging markets like China and India, the UK government led reforms aimed at fostering competitiveness in the sector. In 1988, the government privatized British Steel, allowing the company to become more competitive. The company achieved significant success, as it was able to reduce costs and improve efficiency, leading to an increase in profits. However, with the rise of emerging markets like China and India, British Steel faced intense competition, and the company struggled to remain profitable.
In the wider macro environment, the world was changing rapidly, with technological advancements transforming the way businesses operated. For example, the rise of the internet and e-commerce made it possible for customers to purchase steel from anywhere in the world, which increased competition for British Steel. Furthermore, changes in consumer preferences led to the demand for more specialized steel products, such as high-grade steel for the aerospace and automotive industries. British Steel, with its focus on producing more generic products, struggled to keep up with these changes and faced a decline in demand for its products.
The external environment also played a significant role in driving the company's strategic capabilities and actions. In response to increased competition and changes in the market, British Steel focused on improving its operational efficiency and reducing costs. The company invested heavily in new technologies and processes, which enabled it to improve its production efficiency and reduce lead times between orders. Additionally, the company diversified its product offering by investing in value-added products, such as specialized steels for the automotive industry. British Steel also engaged in labor practices aimed at increasing efficiency, such as downsizing and introducing more flexible working arrangements.
However, despite these efforts, British Steel continued to struggle to remain profitable as competition from emerging markets, and the global economic crisis led to a decline in demand for its products. This led to a major restructuring of the company in 1999, which involved a significant reduction in its workforce. In 2001, the company merged with Dutch company Hoogovens to form Corus, with the aim of becoming stronger and more globally competitive.
The merger of Corus faced numerous challenges, including major cultural and operational differences between the two companies. One of the major challenges of the merger was significantly different corporate cultures between the two companies. Despite being relatively similar in terms of size, the two companies had different management styles, layers and structures, product lines, and corporate cultures, which resulted in significant challenges. Moreover, the merger faced significant financial difficulties due to a significant reduction in steel demand, leading to the company seeing increasing losses in the years following the merger.
Despite these challenges, Corus was able to leverage its strategic capabilities to improve its performance. The company focused on investing in new technologies and processes that allowed it to increase its operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve its product offerings. Additionally, the company engaged in significant downsizing, reducing its workforce by almost half and improving its flexibility and responsiveness to changes in the market. These efforts helped the company improve its performance significantly and return to profitability.
However, Corus faced significant challenges as it attempted to reposition itself in a rapidly changing external environment, including changes in consumer preferences and increased competition from emerging markets. The company struggled to compete on price with emerging market competitors like China, which produced steel at a lower cost. Additionally, the company was impacted by various government regulations aimed at limiting the environmental impact of the industry. These regulations imposed significant cost burdens on the company, which made it difficult to compete effectively with emerging market competitors.
The stakeholders of Corus were significantly impacted by the external environment and decisions made by the company. Employees of the company faced significant changes to their working conditions, with significant downsizing and increased flexibility. Suppliers of the company faced challenges as the company sought to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Customers of the company were also impacted by changes in the market as the company shifted its focus to value-added products and targeted specific industries such as the automotive sector. Finally, shareholders of the company saw significant decreases in share value as the company continued to experience financial difficulties and losses following the merger.
In conclusion, the macro and industrial environment surrounding British Steel before their merger in 2001 was turbulent due to various factors, including changing consumer preferences and the rise of emerging markets, as well as government regulations that aimed to foster competitiveness in the steel industry. The company responded to the changing external environment by focusing on improving its operational efficiency, reducing costs, and diversifying its product offerings. The major challenges faced by the company during the merger with Hoogovens were cultural and operational differences between the two companies, as well as significant financial difficulties due to a reduction in steel demand. The strategic capabilities of the company contributed to their successes and failures, with the company investing in new technologies and processes to reduce cost and improve efficiency. The major stakeholders of Corus were impacted by the external environment and decisions made by the company, including employees, suppliers, customers, and shareholders.
