Introduction 
Hannah Arendt, a wildly celebrated and influential political theorist, has made an immense contribution to modern political philosophy by exploring key concepts that outline the essentials of human society. Her ideas on labor, work, and action have captured the imagination of scholars and readers globally since she first published them in 1958. Arendt’s concepts demonstrate different activities that people undertake that sustain human life throughout history. These three concepts are also essential in understanding the relationship between individuals and society, as well as their role in shaping political philosophy. Moreover, Arendt's theory of the concept of history and Karl Marx's theory on historical materialism suggest that the concept of labor is a fundamental aspect of the human experience, and collective efforts in labour create a bond of shared human experiences. This essay will discuss Hannah Arendt's concepts of labor, work, and action, and their relation to modern political philosophy, in light of her theory of the concept of history and comparison with Marx.  
Hannah Arendt’s Concepts of Labor, Work, and Action 
Hannah Arendt's ideas of labor, work, and action, as outlined in her book “The Human Condition,” intend to clarify the essential practices that sustain human life throughout history. Arendt identifies these activities as labor, work, and action, which are not only crucial to individuals but also to society. Labor refers to biological needs that are necessary for survival but do not require significant skill, such as food, water, and shelter. Labor is repetitive and ongoing, often without immediate end goals. In ancient times, labor was necessary since it constituted the most crucial stages of life, such as infant care and cultivation. Work refers to activities that require skills and contribute to the development of culture and history. Work involves human-made objects that eventually have a lasting impact on human society. Things that people create in this process tend to endure and provide an indication of human existence, such as architecture, literature, music, drama etc. Finally, action provides individuals with a sense of purpose and transcendence beyond biological needs. It often involves political participation and makes a contribution to human history. Arendt believes that action increases human power and strengthens human social relations.
Furthermore, action, which is the highest form of human activity, requires a public space that allows people to engage collectively to exchange thoughts, feelings, and ideas. This public space forms an integral part of the democratic process, especially as people who share common experiences embark on a collaborative journey towards a common good. 
Relation to Modern Political Philosophy
Modern political philosophy treats these three concepts as broad categories, social validators, and economic contributors. Arendt's categorization brings attention to the fundamental concepts that are central to understanding society’s significant factors and how they contribute to the welfare of individuals. For instance, within the labor sphere, the economy depends on individuals who provide the repetitive, low-skilled work required for its growth. In the work sphere, artists, thinkers and other skilled professionals are responsible for humanity's collective development. The products created in this phase bear the marks of human progress in history. Finally, in the action sphere, individuals bring their unique experiences to effect social change for the greater good of the community. The three spheres of human existence are all critical to the dynamics of modern political philosophy.  
Furthermore, because the three concepts intersect with the broad spheres of social life, political systems that fail to sustain these spheres adequately compromise individuals’ welfare. Therefore, the public sector has an essential role in ensuring that these three concepts harmonize within the context of a democratic society. Arendt’s framework vividly demonstrates how political institutions must operate to facilitate and accommodate these three concepts for a society's proper rationalization. 
Theory of Concept of History
Arendt’s theory of the concept of history is that humans form relationships with one another through the acknowledgment of the mutual recognition of the experiences in each other's lives. However, this mutual recognition depends on the activity that individuals perform, and over time, these actions become integrated into time, giving meaning and significance to the past, present, and future for the individuals. Through this, individuals create history. By integrating the activities performed by individuals and comprehending the intricate human relations that these different activities form creates a bond of collective human experiences. 
Arendt believes that human history progresses through the action sphere and not through the labor and work spheres. In The Human Condition, Arendt writes, “History has always been written by the victor and the emphasis, in reading it or writing it, has always been on slaughter rather than love among men.” She believes that the emphasis on labor and work in historical narratives reflects the domination of the victors who view human experience through the lens of domination and exploitation. In this way, history is simply the outcome of human experience through work and labor rather than human action. 
Furthermore, Arendt argues that action allows humans to transcend the limitations of their biological needs and interests to establish a shared reality where individuals can reason with one another. In this sense, action is the foundation for democracy and is what sets it apart from totalitarianism. Thus, Arendt sees action as an essential aspect of human life that is critical to creating and sustaining a democratic society. 
Comparison with Marx
Karl Marx characterizes labor as the engine for human existence, seeing labor as the chief concept responsible for shaping history. According to him, labor primarily drives social change by forming the class struggle. The materialism found in the historical development of society is central to his argument. He claims that the conditions of work and production characterizes a certain epoch by the economic relations that underlie that epoch, making the economic development of society a prime vehicle for social change. Marx sees labor as the critical concept behind economic relations, providing the foundation for economic social relationships. The working class struggle premised on accumulation of wealth and resource distribution, has both been the motivation for change and its consequence. Therefore, Marx’s view on the primacy of labor in human existence is different from Arendt's approach that emphasizes action. 
Moreover, while Marx's theory embraces the notion of a public sphere, Arendt's approach is more focused on the need for a collective public sphere to engage in shared activities that promote democracy. In this sense, Arendt’s concept of action gains a significant influence in the creation of a democratic society, and in this vision; individuals act in a cooperative capacity rather than in a class-oriented manner. This idea is contrary to Marx’s concept, which relies on class-based struggles to transform society. Here, Marx views human beings based on the direct objects of economic and social structures as oppressed or effectively alienated from themselves. In contrast, Arendt’s version of humanism is that individuals’ actions come from interactions with others and contribute to the creation of history. 
Conclusion
In conclusion, Hannah Arendt's concepts of labor, work, and action have contributed significantly to modern political philosophy by clarifying the essential practices that sustain human life throughout history. The three spheres of human existence are essential to the dynamics of modern political philosophy. They intersect with the broad spheres of social life to ensure that political systems and institutions sustain individual welfare. Arendt's thesis of the concept of history shows how individuals integrate activities to form a bond of collective human experiences and that history progresses through the action sphere. While Marx sees labor as the central factor to shaping history, Arendt emphasizes action in creating a democratic society. Arendt envisions a cooperative capacity for individuals in the public sphere rather than a class-based struggle. Through the discussions above, it is clear that both thinkers bring vital insights into the nature of human beings and their impact on human society.
