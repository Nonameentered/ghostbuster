Chest pain is a common symptom that people experience. It can arise from a variety of causes, including heart attacks, pulmonary embolisms, and costochondritis. Chest pain is the most common reason for emergency department visits and is the 2nd leading cause of hospital admissions in the United States. In an A&E, different types of chest pain can be presented, and it is important to understand the different ways chest pain can present to A&E and the differentials for chest pain.
First, chest pain can be classified as stable or unstable. Stable chest pain typically presents as a discomfort that can be relieved by rest or medication. Unstable chest pain, however, is more severe and occurs even at rest. Unstable chest pain is more indicative of an acute coronary syndrome, such as myocardial infarction (MI).
MI can present atypically, meaning the symptoms are not typical for a heart attack. Atypical symptoms include nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. In some cases, a patient may not experience any chest pain at all. In these cases, it is important to recognize the other symptoms that can indicate a heart attack. Routine blood tests can also provide valuable information if MI is suspected. A creatinine kinase-MB and troponin levels would be ordered. Troponin levels, in particular, can be helpful in diagnosing MI because troponin is released into the bloodstream when heart cells are damaged.
There are three types of acute coronary syndromes: unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI. Unstable angina is chest pain that occurs even at rest, and is often a precursor to MI. NSTEMI (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction) is a type of MI that occurs when there is a partial blockage of an artery in the heart. STEMI (ST-elevation myocardial infarction) is a more severe type of MI that occurs when there is a complete blockage of an artery in the heart.
When a patient presents with chest pain, their history and examination provide important clues to help diagnose the underlying cause. The patient's age, gender, risk factors for heart disease, and family history of heart disease are all considered during diagnosis. The examination may include a physical exam, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and chest x-rays.
Other factors that should be considered in treating chest pain include the patient's medical history, other medical conditions the patient may have, and any medications the patient may be taking. For example, some medications such as beta-blockers can affect the body's response to chest pain and can mask some of the symptoms of MI.
In conclusion, chest pain is a common symptom that can be indicative of a variety of conditions. In an A&E, different types of chest pain can be presented, and it is important to understand the differentials for chest pain. It is also important to recognize the atypical ways in which MI can present. Routine blood tests can provide valuable information in diagnosing MI. There are three types of acute coronary syndromes: unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI. When a patient presents with chest pain, their history and examination provide important clues in diagnosing the underlying cause. Other factors such as the patient's medical history, other medical conditions, and the medications they are taking should also be considered in treating chest pain.
