Laura has experienced a terrible situation while using the services of Slowe and Wheezy Bus Company. Unfortunately, Laura slipped and fell while boarding the bus and got injured. As a result, she wants to know what legal options are available for her to recover damages from Slowe and Wheezy Bus Company. In this essay, we will explore the legal options available for Laura to recover damages and how the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 could apply to her case.
The first option available for Laura is to file a negligence claim against Slowe and Wheezy Bus Company. Negligence is a tort that occurs when one person breaches their duty of care towards another person, resulting in damage or injury to that person. In this case, Slowe and Wheezy Bus Company have a duty of care to ensure the safety of their passengers while boarding and alighting the bus. As a result, the bus company has breached its duty of care towards Laura, and this negligence caused her injury.
To prove negligence, Laura must show that Slowe and Wheezy Bus Company owed her a duty of care, they breached their duty of care, and as a result, she suffered damage or injury. In this case, the bus company owed Laura a duty of care as a passenger. She required protection and support while boarding or alighting the bus. The company breached its duty of care by not ensuring that the bus was safe for its passengers, resulting in Laura slipping and falling. Finally, Laura suffered injuries as a result of the breach of duty of care. Therefore, Laura has a good chance to successfully win a negligence case against the Slowe and Wheezy Bus Company.
The second legal option available for Laura is to file a claim of breach of contract against Slowe and Wheezy Bus Company. The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 apply to this case. The Act is designed to protect consumers from unfair contractual terms that businesses include in their contracts. The regulations provide guidance on what is considered an unfair term in a consumer contract.
Essentially, a breach of contract is a situation that arises when one party fails to meet their contractual obligations. In this case, the contract is between Laura and the Slowe and Wheezy Bus Company. The company has a duty to ensure the safety of passengers when getting in or out of the bus. By failing to provide a safe environment, the company is in breach of its contract with Laura. Thus, she has the right to receive damages for this breach in the form of compensation.
The Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 may apply to Laura’s situation. According to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999, a contract term is deemed unfair if it causes a significant imbalance in the rights and obligations of the parties under the contract, to the detriment of the consumer. In essence, it means that a contract term must be fair, transparent and prominently shown such that the consumer is aware of what they are agreeing to.
In this case, Laura’s contract with Slowe and Wheezy Bus Company can be deemed unfair and a breach of the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. Firstly, the clause that Laura agreed to when purchasing the ticket may be considered unfair. For instance, the clause could have stated that the company accepts no liability for any injury sustained by any passenger when boarding or alighting from the bus. Such a clause would constitute an unfair term under the regulations as it violates the principles of reasonableness and expedience.
Secondly, the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 could apply in this case. The Act regulates the use of exclusion clauses in contracts. The law stipulates that in the case of consumer contracts, exclusion clauses that seek to exclude or limit liability for injury or death are only valid if they satisfy the requirement of reasonableness. A clause will be deemed reasonable if it takes into account all the important factors, including the bargaining power between the parties, the price for the goods or services, and whether the lessors have offered any alternative protection to the consumer.
In Laura’s case, if the bus company had a clause in its contract that sought to exclude or limit liability for injury or death, it would have to satisfy the requirement of reasonableness. It would involve considering the circumstances and factors surrounding the contract.
In conclusion, Laura has two legal options available to her to recover damages from Slowe and Wheezy Bus Company. Her first option is to file a negligence claim against the company. This claim is based on the premise that the company breached its duty of care by not providing a safe environment, resulting in Laura slipping and falling. The second option is a breach of contract claim under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999. According to Laura’s contract with Slowe and Wheezy Bus Company, the company breached its contract by failing to ensure the safety of passengers boarding and alighting the bus. These breaches according to both Acts and regulations, could be deemed unfair, making her claims stronger. Therefore, Laura could potentially receive damages in the form of compensation from the Slowe and Wheezy Bus Company through either of these legal processes.
