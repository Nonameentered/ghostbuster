Frank Jackson’s Knowledge Argument is one of the most influential arguments against physicalism in the philosophy of mind. In his argument, Jackson appeals to Mary’s experience of the monochromatic room to demonstrate that even if someone has comprehensive physical knowledge about the world, there will still be some aspects of phenomenal experience that cannot be fully understood from a third-person, physicalist perspective. In this essay, I will discuss Jackson's Knowledge Argument and how he uses Mary’s experience to argue against physicalism. I will also explore Jackson’s view on qualia and how it relates to his argument, as well as some of the objections he poses and how he responds to them. Finally, I will consider whether Jackson ultimately provides a satisfactory explanation of qualia.
Jackson’s Knowledge Argument is a thought experiment that aims to show that physicalism, the view that everything in the world can be explained by physical facts alone, is false. According to Jackson, if physicalism is true, then Mary, a scientist who has complete knowledge of all the physical facts about color vision, should be able to predict everything that there is to know about what it is like to see red. However, Jackson argues that Mary would learn something new about the subjective experience of seeing red if she herself were to experience it for the first time. Therefore, there is something about that experience that cannot be explained by physical facts alone, and physicalism is false.
To further illustrate his argument, Jackson presents the scenario of Mary, a brilliant neuroscientist who is confined to a black and white room and has only ever experienced the world through a black and white TV screen. From this position, Mary has access to all the physical knowledge available to her and has a comprehensive understanding of the neural processes taking place when human beings see colors. However, despite her extensive knowledge, Mary has no subjective experience of what it is like to see color. 
Now imagine that one day, Mary is released from the black and white room and is allowed to see color for the first time. In this moment of surprise and awe, Mary learns something new about color perception, which cannot be explained by her previous physical knowledge. This, according to Jackson, shows that there is something about the subjective experience of color that physicalism cannot account for.
Jackson uses this argument to challenge the idea that all mental states can be reduced to brain states. He argues that even if we have understood every physical fact about the way the brain processes information and correlates with mental states, it still would not include the subjective experience of what it feels like to have those mental states. In other words, there is something about our conscious experiences, or qualia, that cannot be captured by physical description alone.
Jackson's view of qualia is that they are the subjective, phenomenal experiences that we have when we see, hear, smell, taste or touch something. Qualia are often described as the subjective “feel” of experience. For example, the experience of seeing the color red is accompanied by a sense of what it is like to see that particular red, and this particular feel is what constitutes the mental state of seeing red.
Jackson’s argument is that qualia cannot be explained by any physical facts about the world. According to him, phenomenal experience has a subjective, first-person character that cannot be reduced to objective, third-person descriptions of physical processes. This means that physicalism cannot account for the full range of conscious experience.
The Knowledge Argument has been subject to a range of criticisms since its introduction. One objection to the argument is the claim that it relies on a misleading way of thinking about knowledge. Critics argue that Mary doesn’t actually gain new knowledge about color perception when she sees color for the first time. Instead, they suggest that she simply has a new experience that she didn’t have before. However, Jackson responds by pointing out that the argument is not just about knowledge in the sense of factual understanding, but it's about having a full acquaintance of an experience, which can only be gained through direct first-person experience.
Another objection is that the argument relies on a false assumption that Mary’s black and white room experience is the same thing as being completely ignorant about color perception. Critics argue that even though Mary has not experienced color, she has a rich understanding of what it is like to see colors based on information that she has gathered throughout her life. Therefore, Mary’s experience of the black and white room is not the same as that of a person who is completely ignorant about color perception. However, Jackson responds that this is precisely the point of the argument: even if Mary has the richest possible understanding of color vision in purely physical terms, there is still something that can only be grasped through first-person experience.
Despite these criticisms, the Knowledge Argument has been influential in the philosophy of mind and has helped to challenge the idea that subjective experience can be entirely reduced to physical descriptions. Jackson’s argument has and continues to inspire a range of other arguments for the non-physicalist view that qualia are irreducible to physical description.
In conclusion, Jackson’s Knowledge Argument uses Mary’s experience in the monochromatic room to demonstrate that physicalism is false. He argues that even if someone has comprehensive physical knowledge about the world, there will still be some aspects of phenomenal experience that cannot be fully understood from a third-person, physicalist perspective. Jackson believes that qualia, the subjective, phenomenal experiences that we have when we see, hear, smell, taste or touch something, cannot be explained by any physical facts about the world. In response to criticisms, he maintains that his argument holds, as the concept of knowledge in his argument is meant to be the understanding or full acquaintance of an experience that can only be achieved by first-person experience. Although some criticisms have been levelled against his argument, Jackson’s Knowledge Argument remains a significant contribution to the philosophy of mind and has helped to influence the development of non-physicalist accounts of consciousness.
