The United States' "war on terror" has been a central focus of U.S. foreign policy since the 9/11 attacks in 2001. This war has primarily been fought against Islamic extremist groups in the Middle East, such as Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Islamic State. However, this focus on the Middle East has resulted in a diversion of attention and resources away from East Asia, which has prevented the United States from establishing its hegemony in the region. This essay will analyze the causes and effects of this diversion of attention and resources and its hindrance on the United States' establishment of hegemony in the East Asian region.
At the heart of the issue is the fact that the United States' military presence in the Middle East has been much larger and more significant than its presence in East Asia. Since the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. government has deployed thousands of troops to Iraq, Afghanistan, and other countries in the Middle East to fight Islamic extremist groups. This deployment of troops has been accompanied by significant international aid, which has also been targeted towards the Middle East. As a result, the financial and logistical resources that would have been needed to establish a significant military and aid presence in East Asia have been diverted towards the Middle East.
One of the most significant consequences of this diversion of resources has been the weakening of the United States' ability to establish a significant military presence in East Asia. As China has risen to become a major global power, the United States' ability to project its military power into the region has become increasingly important. However, the "war on terror" has consumed a significant portion of the United States' military budget and has prevented the U.S. government from investing the resources needed to establish a robust military presence in the region. This has left the United States with limited options for projecting its military power into East Asia, which has hindered its ability to establish hegemony in the region.
Another significant consequence of the diversion of resources towards the "war on terror" has been the loss of diplomatic leverage that the United States would have had in East Asia. Diplomatic leverage is the ability of a country to use its economic and political power to influence other countries' behavior. If the United States had invested significant resources into establishing aid and investment programs in East Asia, it would have had significant diplomatic leverage in the region. However, the U.S. government has been unable to do so due to the diversion of resources towards the "war on terror." This has left the United States with a weaker diplomatic position in East Asia than it would have had otherwise, which has made it more difficult for the United States to establish hegemony in the region.
Finally, the diversion of resources towards the "war on terror" has also weakened the United States' economic position in East Asia. The United States is the largest economy in the world, and its economic power has been one of the central pillars of its global hegemony. However, as China has risen to become a major economic power, the importance of the United States' economic position in East Asia has increased. The problem is that the "war on terror" has consumed significant resources that could have been invested in economic development programs in East Asia. This has left the United States with a weaker economic position in the region than it would have had otherwise, which has hindered its ability to establish hegemony in the region.
In conclusion, the "war on terror" has diverted significant resources away from East Asia and towards the Middle East. This diversion of resources has had a significant impact on the United States' ability to establish hegemony in the East Asian region. The United States' inability to establish a significant military presence in the region, weaker diplomatic leverage, and weaker economic position have all contributed to this hindrance. Moving forward, the United States will need to reorient its foreign policy priorities away from the Middle East and towards East Asia if it wants to establish and maintain its hegemony in the region.
