Memorials represent a crucial part of cultural heritage and serve as physical tokens that pay tribute to events and people that have shaped our shared history. War memorials, in particular, play a significant role in commemorating the soldiers who fought, the atrocities that occurred, and the significance of the event in human history. However, the portrayal of war memorials as glorifiers of war or a warning against it has spurred debates among scholars and policymakers across the globe.
On the one hand, the connotation associated with war memorials glorifying war highlights the positive attributes associated with military endeavors, such as heroism, sacrifice, and victory. These monuments often harbor a nostalgic portrait of the past, upholding the achievements of soldiers and the government in power at that time. A perfect example of this portrayal of war memorials is the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, a monument that predominantly commemorates the sacrifices of French soldiers and military achievements during and after the French Revolution. The arch stands at the western end of the famous Champs-Élysées Avenue, bearing an inscription that reads "To the armies of France that died here 1914-1918." The monument's scale, intricate design, and elongated history undoubtedly allude to the pride and glory the French feel in their military history.
Similarly, the Vietnam War Memorial, located in Washington DC, USA, immortalizes the 58,138 American soldiers who died in the Vietnam War between 1955 and 1975. The structure comprises black granite walls on which the names of the soldiers are inscribed chronologically according to their time of death or disappearance. This 150-meter-long monument evokes strong emotions of pride and honor as soldiers, and government officials celebrate the American military achievements during the Vietnam War. The structure's linear and minimalist design, combined with the patriotic symbolism of the American flag flanking the edges of the wall, epitomizes a glorification of the fallen soldiers and the sacrifices they made for their country.
On the other hand, there is an alternative view that war memorials implicitly promote peace by teaching about the consequences of war. These memorials serve as a reminder of the disastrous impact of wars, not only on soldiers but also on civilians caught up in those conflicts. Memorials featuring scenes of violence, defeat, and loss are compelling reminders of the futility and devastation of conflicts. A classic example of this view is the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, Japan, which honors the victims of the first atomic bomb that was dropped on the city on August 6, 1945. The memorial park has shallow pools, extensive lawns, and numerous memorials that recall the incident's victims, including the Atomic Bomb Dome, the iconic structure that was the only building left standing after the bombing.
The other memorial structures on the site further reinforce the devastating effects of the bombing and the need to pursue peace and disarmament. The Memorial Cathedral for World Peace, for instance, is a modern structure that showcases the diverse religions of humanity, and the Cenotaph stands at the center of the park and features the names of all the victims who died from the effects of the bombing. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial's original intent was to provide a somber remembrance of the war's destructive effects and serve as a warning against further proliferation and use of nuclear weapons.
In another example, the Dunkirk War Memorial in France is a poignant symbol of the horrors of war. The memorial was erected to commemorate the evacuation of British and Allied troops from Dunkirk's beaches after they were cornered by German soldiers during World War II. The memorial features a darkly etched bronze relief showing soldiers evading German troops, and twisted bodies, could allude to the human suffering and horror of war. The memorial's stark and rather somber design evokes reflection, revulsion, and even guilt for the unfortunate event, serving as a warning for the threats of war and the cost of life.
Moreover, the overall impact of any war memorial also depends on the initial intent of the commemoration. Are the memorials meant to indoctrinate, educate or foster a sense of nationalism, or act as somber reminders of an event? For instance, the Iwo Jima Memorial, USA, which commemorates the Battle of Iwo Jima during World War II, is instantly recognizable for the iconic statue showing the American flag being raised on foreign soil. The context of that picture was that the conflict had cost more casualties than many other battles during World War II. The Marine Corps War Memorial, as it is officially known, was initially envisioned to serve as an inspirational symbol of the high standards of character and courage embodied by members of the US Marines. It wasn't until later that it began to be seen as an encapsulation of the patriotic spirit of the nation that propelled it to become a major global superpower.
Similarly, the Chesty Puller Memorial in America is dedicated to Lt. General Lewis Puller, a Marine whose military heroism exemplified patriotism and valor. The statue depicts General Puller in his combat uniform with his eyes fixed firmly on his troops, upholding America's image of a selfless, heroic military leader, epitomizing the glorification of war. In contrast, the African American Civil War Memorial in Washington, D.C., serves as a poignant reminder of the human cost of war and highlights the contribution of African Americans to the struggle for equal rights in America.
In conclusion, memorials play an essential role in shaping public memory and informing our collective understanding of history. The perception of whether war memorials glorify war or serve as a warning is a subjective one that depends on the initial intent and context of the commemoration. War memorials that celebrate victory and heroism in military endeavors tend to evoke emotions of national pride and valor and can perpetuate a culture of war. In contrast, those memorial structures focusing on a somber remembrance of war's devastating effects serve as a warning of the futility and horror of war. Overall, memorials have the potential to inspire or dishearten, educate or indoctrinate, and unite or divide, and governments should consider these nuances in designing and constructing these monuments.
