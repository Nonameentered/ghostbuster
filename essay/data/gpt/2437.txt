Over the years, the history of Greek society has been marked by various debates and discussions about women and their roles in society. The Athenian society, in particular, was known for its patriarchal system, where the men held power and authority, and the women were expected to remain in the background. The Athenian women were often depicted as being 'secluded' from men, but to what extent is this accurate? This essay seeks to explore the social and cultural realities of Athenian women and their relationship with men throughout their society, and how the social class of these women contributed to the perceptions of their seclusion or lack thereof.
In the Athenian society, it was a norm that women should be protected and looked after. Athenian women were inferior to men in virtually every aspect of life. In particular, the women were not expected to interact with males that were not members of their family. This led to the popular perception that Athenian women were segregated or 'secluded' from men. However, in reality, the extent to which Athenian women were separated from men varied depending on social class and their status as hetaerae or wives. 
The system of seclusion, for the most part, was applied to the wives of the Athenian people who were of the upper social class. Women of this social class were expected to be modest, and they were often confined to the house and protected by a bodyguard. They were also restricted from performing outdoor activities and included working in the market in sharp contrast to their counterparts a few social classes lower.
Although it was uncommon for women in Athens to engage in public life, Athenian women of the upper social class could own land and oversee property in the absence of their husbands. They were known to have a great deal of economic influence and power because of the numerous slaves and other domestic workers who served them. However, this kind of power was limited since it was solely granted to the married women, and they needed their husbands' consent to transact or inherit property. Moreover, women of this class were the only ones allowed to attend religious festivals primarily held for women.
It is crucial to acknowledge that while women of this class were seclude, they often had excellent education and were knowledgeable in literature, music, dance, and other arts. This is because during this period, private tutors would teach the daughters of influential families in their homes.
Unlike wives, hetaerae were not expected to stay at home, and their roles were not confined to private life. These women enjoyed more freedom than other Athenian women because they were skilled in dancing, music, and other forms of entertainment. Hetaerae were trained to be witty, eloquent and creative in their conversation. They were known to attend crucial public and political events and were allowed to participate in symposia. Symposiums were gatherings facilitated by men to drink, indulge in revelries and engage in philosophical discussions. Hetaerae, which included prostitutes and courtesans, played a significant role in these social gatherings as they were critical to the entertainment of guests.
Hetaerae were often recognized for their beauty and charm, and their talent could earn them significant wealth. However, they were considered socially stigmatized for their profession. Hetaerae were often denied relevance or recognition in their society despite their contributions. Nonetheless, they played an essential role in shaping the Athenian society because of their participation in the symposium and because they were seen as an essential component of Athenian culture.
The lower social class women, however, lived a different life compared to the women in the upper class society. They had to work tirelessly to support themselves and their families. Women of lower social classes had no chance of being confined in the house because they had to work to support their families. Their roles in society were not considered important, and they were often overlooked, and their activities went unnoticed. They would engage in tasks such as agriculture, nurturing, and various forms of small businesses to provide for their families.
Therefore, the extent to which Athenian women were secluded from men was dependent on the social class of women. Women of the upper social class lived a segregated life, while those in a lower social class were not seclude from men, instead often working shoulder to shoulder with men.
In conclusion, Athenian women were known for being 'secluded' from men, but this perception was dependent on the social class of the women in question. The women's social status and societal norms and expectations shaped their experience in Athenian society, and the differences between the classes were significant. Women of the upper class were confined to their homes and protected by a bodyguard, whereas the lower-class women were not seclude from the men as they were expected to work to support their families in the absence of men. Hetaerae, on the other hand, provided entertainment and socialization to the men. Despite these differences, Athenian women who could afford private tutors were educated and knowledgeable in the arts and music. Therefore, the claims of 'seclusion' cannot be generalized to all Athenian women because the seclusion, or lack thereof, was heavily impacted by the class of the women in question.
