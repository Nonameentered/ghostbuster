William Shakespeare's Othello is a tragedy that has intrigued scholars and audiences alike for centuries. Its intricate plot and complicated characters have captured the hearts and minds of readers, and have been subjects of intense analysis. The play is regarded as one of Shakespeare's greatest works, and it is widely studied for its complex themes and engaging characters. In this essay, I will explore the extent to which Shakespeare applies Aristotle's principles of tragedy in Othello, particularly examining the reasons for Desdemona's tragedy.
Aristotle's principles of tragedy are detailed in his work, Poetics. According to Aristotle, a tragedy is a form of drama that revolves around a central character who experiences a reversal of fortune due to a tragic flaw. This experience of the tragic hero provides audiences with catharsis, which is a process of emotional purging. Aristotle's principles of tragedy are evident in many of Shakespeare's works, and Othello is no exception.
Othello is the tragic hero of the play, and his tragic flaw is his jealousy. Othello's jealousy is a deep-seated emotion that is fuelled by his insecurity and his lack of confidence. This flaw leads him to believe that his wife, Desdemona, is unfaithful, which sets in motion a series of events that ultimately leads to his downfall.
Desdemona is not a tragic hero in the traditional sense. However, she is a tragic character who experiences a terrible fate that is beyond her control. Her tragedy is caused by her love for Othello, which ultimately leads to her death.
Desdemona is a pure and innocent character who loves Othello deeply. She is loyal to him, and her love is genuine. However, her love for Othello ultimately becomes her undoing. Othello's jealousy and suspicion overpower his love for Desdemona, and he becomes convinced that she is unfaithful. His jealousy is so intense that he sees her love for him as a threat to his masculinity and his social status. He becomes consumed by his jealousy and becomes violent towards Desdemona, ultimately leading to her tragic fate.
Desdemona's tragedy is a result of her love for Othello, and her inability to protect herself from his jealousy. She is a victim of circumstances that are beyond her control, and she is unable to change the course of events that lead to her death. Her tragedy is a result of the actions of the other characters and the society in which she lives, rather than any flaw in her character.
In Othello, Shakespeare applies Aristotle's principles of tragedy in a number of ways. Firstly, Othello is a clear example of a tragic hero. His tragic flaw is his jealousy, and this flaw ultimately leads to his downfall. The audience is able to experience catharsis through Othello's tragic journey, and his death provides closure for the audience.
Secondly, Desdemona's tragedy aligns with Aristotle's principles of tragedy. She is a character who experiences a terrible fate that is beyond her control. Her tragic fate is a result of the actions of others, rather than any flaw in her character. Desdemona's death is a tragic end to a character who is pure and innocent, and her death evokes an emotional response from the audience.
Finally, the play aligns with Aristotle's principles of tragedy in its exploration of themes such as jealousy, love, ambition, and power. These themes are intricately woven together to create a complex and engaging plot that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats.
In conclusion, Shakespeare applies Aristotle's principles of tragedy to Othello in a number of ways. Othello is a clear example of a tragic hero, and Desdemona's tragedy aligns with Aristotle's principles of tragedy. The play explores complex themes that are universal and timeless, and the characters' experiences elicit an emotional response from the audience. Desdemona's tragedy is a result of her love for Othello, which ultimately leads to her death. Her tragedy is not the result of any character flaw, but rather a result of circumstances that are beyond her control. In this way, Shakespeare creates a complicated and engaging tragedy that has stood the test of time.
