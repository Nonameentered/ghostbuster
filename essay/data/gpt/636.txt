The advent of the internet has completely revolutionized the way businesses operate. It has given companies the ability to reach a broader audience than ever before and provide more efficient and streamlined services. Therefore, it can be argued that it is not a good idea for companies to ignore the internet as a way of selling policies. In this essay, I will analyze the potential benefits and drawbacks of using the internet to widen a target market and streamline services offered, and provide examples of how companies have struggled with implementing new technology and improvements to project management approaches.
One significant benefit of using the internet to sell policies is the ability to reach a wider audience. In today's world, where almost everyone has access to the internet, online channels provide access to a vast pool of potential customers. By utilizing these channels, companies can achieve amplification in marketing their products and policies. Moreover, companies can provide a more personalized and efficient service to customers through online tools. Reaching and serving clients effectively can, in turn, lead to increased profitability, customer satisfaction, and long-term loyalty.
Another advantage of using the internet for policy sales is cost-effectiveness. Building and maintaining an online presence can significantly reduce overhead costs. Rent on commercial properties, office supplies, and personnel no longer have to be factored into overall costs, which can significantly reduce costs. Additionally, online channels often allow for more efficient transactional procedures, leading to cost savings for both the customer and the company.
However, there are some potential drawbacks to relying solely on the internet when selling policies. One such challenge is the potential loss of the human touch. Customers may feel they are not being provided the personal attention they deserve, which, in turn, can lead to customer dissatisfaction and even the loss of business. Finding a balance between online tools and customer service representatives can address this issue.
Another significant problem is cyber threats. Using online channels for policy sales increase the likelihood of cyber threats such as hacking, data breaches, and fraudulent activities. To address this issue, companies must adopt state-of-the-art cybersecurity software and protocols to protect their clients and their confidential information. Failure to do so can lead to irreversible reputational damage.
Companies often struggle with implementing new technology. In 2013, healthcare.gov suffered a myriad of technical problems during its rollout. The website was inundated with heavy traffic and faced numerous issues with registration, security, and user interfaces. The healthcare.gov project was devoid of a well-thought-out project management approach, leading to tremendous cost implications and severe reputational damage.
To avoid similar missteps, companies can adopt several approaches to technology implementation. For instance, organizations can systematically analyze the impact of the new technology and assess its feasibility. A well-crafted plan should include providing adequate resources required for implementation, sufficient technical capabilities, and well-trained human resources. Developers should also prioritize user experience, perform rigorous testing of new technologies, and provide real-time or responsive support.
In conclusion, it is not a good idea for companies to ignore the internet as a way of selling policies. There are significant benefits to be obtained by widening the target market and streamlining services offered through online channels. However, businesses should also be judicious about the potential drawbacks and implement measures to mitigate risks. It is also crucial to take a well-informed and systematic approach to implementing new technologies and improving project management approaches to ensure successful implementation, satisfied customers, and long-term profitability.
