Saul Kripke is a prominent philosopher whose work has covered a broad range of topics in philosophy, including logic, metaphysics, and epistemology. One of his most famous contributions to the field is his discussion of necessary and contingent statements and their relation to a priori and a posteriori knowledge. In this essay, I will explain Kripke's argument regarding necessary and contingent statements and their relation to a priori and a posteriori knowledge.
To understand Kripke's argument, it is essential to first define some key terms. A necessary statement is one that must be true and cannot be false, given the way the world is. For example, the statement "2+2=4" is necessarily true because it is impossible for the proposition to be false. A contingent statement, on the other hand, is one that is true, but could have been false, given the way the world is. For example, the statement "It is raining outside" is contingent because it is true only if it is, in fact, raining outside.
A priori knowledge is knowledge that we can acquire independent of experience. This includes knowledge that is directly accessible through the use of reason or intuition. For example, we can know that "all bachelors are unmarried" a priori because we can understand the definition of "bachelor" and "unmarried" without needing to observe the world. A posteriori knowledge, on the other hand, is knowledge that requires experience or observation. For example, we can know that "it is raining outside" a posteriori because we need to observe the world to know whether it is indeed raining.
Kripke's argument begins with the claim that some statements are necessarily true or false, regardless of what we observe about the world. This is the case with many mathematical statements, such as "2+2=4". Kripke argues that these necessary truths cannot simply be based on our observations about the world because they hold true regardless of the state of the world. Instead, he argues that these necessary truths must be grounded in some kind of non-empirical, a priori knowledge.
Kripke's argument also moves to the idea of rigid designators. A rigid designator is a term or expression that refers to the same object in all possible worlds. For example, "water" is a rigid designator because it refers to the same substance in all possible worlds. However, Kripke claims that not all terms are rigid designators. For example, "gold" might not be a rigid designator because there could be a possible world in which what we currently call "gold" has different properties or even does not exist at all.
With this distinction between necessary truths and rigid designators in mind, Kripke then argues that there are necessary truths that cannot be known a priori, but are only knowable a posteriori. This is because some necessary truths are necessarily true because of the way the world is, and not simply because of the way we define terms or concepts. For example, the statement "water is H2O" is necessarily true, but we could not have known it a priori, because we needed to discover the chemical composition of water empirically.
Kripke's argument also involves the concept of "possible worlds". A possible world is a hypothetical state of affairs that could have been the case, but is not necessarily the case in our world. For example, it is possible that water does not exist, or that there is a world in which water has different properties. Kripke argues that some necessary truths are necessary across all possible worlds, regardless of the specific details of those worlds. For example, "all bachelors are unmarried" is necessarily true in all possible worlds because the concept of "bachelor" is defined as an unmarried man.
Kripke's argument has important implications for our understanding of knowledge and truth. It suggests that some necessary truths can only be known through empirical observation, rather than through a priori intuition. This means that our knowledge of the world is not just based on logical deductions or intuitions, but on empirical investigation as well. It also suggests that some statements that we thought were contingent may in fact be necessary, depending on how we define the terms involved. For example, "water is H2O" might have seemed like a contingent statement before we discovered its chemical composition, but it is actually necessarily true.
Another implication of Kripke's argument is that some knowledge is derived from the nature of the world rather than from our concepts and definitions. This challenges the view that all knowledge is constructed from our concepts and mental categories, and suggests that there is a reality outside of our minds that constrains the way we think about the world.
In conclusion, Kripke's argument regarding necessary and contingent statements and their relation to a priori and a posteriori knowledge has profound implications for our understanding of knowledge and truth. It suggests that some necessary truths can only be known empirically, and that our knowledge of the world is not just constructed from our concepts and definitions, but is also constrained by the nature of the world itself. It challenges us to rethink our assumptions about the sources of knowledge and truth, and to recognize the complex interplay between empirical investigation, logical deduction, and our concepts and mental categories.
