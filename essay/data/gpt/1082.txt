Morality and religion have been entwined for centuries, shaping how people make ethical decisions, adopt ethical beliefs and live moral lives. While some people believe that morality can only be justified through religion, others argue that morality is independent of religion and that religion cannot claim monopoly over moral values. This essay will explore the viewpoints of moral relativism and moral objectivism, evaluate whether the relativist's position requires religion for justification, and consider the incorporation of a universal morality based on human and sentient-being nature.
Moral relativism posits that there are no objective moral truths and that moral values and beliefs are relative to individuals, cultures, and societies. This means that morality is not fixed, but rather determined by one's subjective experiences and beliefs. The relativist recognizes that moral values are culturally shaped and that what is morally right or wrong in one culture may not be the same in another culture. Thus, relativism rejects the notion of absolute moral truths and claims that moral values are socially constructed and context-dependent. Conversely, moral objectivism posits that there are objective moral truths that are universal and that apply to all individuals regardless of their culture or beliefs. This means that morality is not determined by culture or experience but is instead inherent in the nature of human beings.
Advocates of moral relativism argue that morality does not need religion for justification. They claim that morality is a product of social evolution, where society develops certain beliefs, values, and practices that help it survive. These values and practices evolve over time and are shaped by cultural, historical, and social factors. Moreover, they argue that morality is based on empathy, compassion, and social cooperation. Thus, morality is not arbitrary but is grounded in social and biological factors. Therefore, the relativist claims that religion cannot claim monopoly over moral values since morality is independent of religion.
However, moral relativism can lead to subjectivism and nihilism. Subjectivism is the belief that moral values are determined by individual preferences and opinions. In contrast, nihilism is the belief that morality does not exist, and everything is permitted. These two positions reveal the shortcomings of moral relativism in justifying moral values in society. On the one hand, subjectivism implies that moral values are arbitrary and are determined by the subjective opinions of individuals. This implies that a moral statement such as 'murder is wrong' may be true for one person but false for another person who finds murder acceptable. On the other hand, nihilism implies that there are no moral values and that anything goes. This implies that society cannot function without moral guidelines that define what is acceptable or unacceptable behavior.
For a relativist, incorporation of a universal morality that is grounded in human and sentient-being nature provides a convincing alternative to these pitfalls. By arguing that certain moral values are universal and that these values are grounded in human and sentient-being nature, a relativist can provide a basis for justifying moral values in a way that transcends cultural, historical, and social contexts. For instance, a Universal Declaration of Human Rights was created which is based on the idea that all human beings are inherently free and equal and are entitled to basic freedoms such as freedom of thought, conscience, and religion.
However, the practical implementation of a universal morality would still depend on the agreement of various cultures and societies. The difficulty with this is that there is still the potential for disagreement and conflict over what constitutes a 'universal morality.' Moreover, it may be difficult to convince people who hold different cultural or religious views of the validity of this morality, divers contentions of ethical doctrines would continue to exist. 
There is a notion that relativists may turn to religion to enforce their view of morality. This acknowledges the significant role that religion has played in shaping moral values in society. Without denying the importance of religious morality, the relativist may argue that religion plays a complementary role in advancing moral values in society. This view is particularly common in religious societies where moral values are intertwined with religious beliefs. However, this position does not imply that religion is necessary for moral justification since moral values can still be grounded in human and sentient-being nature.
In conclusion, morality can be justified without religion, as evidenced by the arguments put forth by moral relativists. While moral relativism recognizes the importance of cultural and social factors in shaping moral values, it also recognizes the dangers of subjectivism and nihilism in justifying these values. A universal morality that is grounded in human and sentient-being nature can provide a basis for justifying moral values that transcend cultural and historical contexts. Nonetheless, implementation would require agreement and compromise and the possibility of conflicts still exists. While religion has played a role in shaping moral values, it is not necessary for their justification, and a universal morality can still be grounded in human and sentient-being nature.
