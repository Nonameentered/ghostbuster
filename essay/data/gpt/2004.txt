The British Isles, excluding Ireland, have undergone significant pedogenesis from Neolithic to the Iron Age. During this time period, the development of Man and his impact on vegetation, as well as the different major soil types and the impact of Man on soils and vegetation for both lowland and upland regions, were crucial factors in shaping the landscape we see today. This essay will describe the pedogenesis of the British Isles during this time period and provide a conclusion on the impact on vegetation.
Neolithic Period
During the Neolithic period, which spanned from 4000-2500 BC, the British Isles received significant human habitation. These early humans largely subsisted through agriculture, with crops such as barley and wheat being grown extensively. The prolonged agricultural activity during this period of the early Bronze Age and Neolithic likely led to soil degradation and the loss of organic matter in lowlands.
The development of people from hunters to farmers and small-scale settlement resulted in a shift in vegetation. The woodland cover that had persisted since the Ice Age retreated and heathland and grassland formations became more common. This shift was caused by humans clearing and burning woodland to create fields and pastures for farming and herding. The development of agriculture and the clearing of woodland for this purpose led to a decline in the soil quality of the landscape.
Bronze Age
The Bronze Age, dating from 2500-800 BC, saw a further development of agricultural practices. During this time, the use of metal tools increased the efficiency and productivity of farming. With the increased use of metal tools, widespread cultivation began leading to a further decline in the soil quality.
It was found that hillside soils were fertilized by the droppings of grazing animals such as sheep and cattle, which allowed for continuous grazing. The soils became rich with nutrients, and the heathland was transformed into a kind of grassland. This grassland then saw a decrease in tree cover, allowing for birch, willow, and pine to colonize further.
The Bronze Age saw the beginning of the widespread use of charcoal for metalworking which was a significant cause of deforestation. The production of charcoal necessitated the felling of trees which further led to the loss of woodland cover. The charcoal was essential for the production of bronze, which was widely used during this period.
Iron Age
The Iron Age, dating from 800 BC to AD 43, saw the introduction of iron tools and the further development of agriculture. Iron tools were far more efficient than their bronze counterparts, leading to an even greater increase in agricultural productivity. The use of iron plows to till the soil resulted in further soil degradation.
Overall, the development of Man during this time period had a significant impact on the vegetation of the British Isles. Human activity was a key driver of shifts in vegetation, with the major change being the loss of woodland and the resulting increase in grassland and heathland formations.
Soil Types
There are three major soil types in the British Isles: Podzols, Brown Earths, and Gleysols. Podzols are characterized by a sandy surface horizon and an accumulation of iron which results in a yellow-brown color. They are found primarily in upland areas. Brown Earths are characterized by a deep accumulation of humus and are fertile, making them ideal for agriculture. They are found in lowland areas. Gleysols are characterized by a blue-grey color caused by saturation and reduced oxygenation of the soil. They are primarily found in poorly drained lowland areas.
Impact of Man on Soils and Vegetation in Lowland and Upland Regions
Lowland Regions
In lowland areas, human activity, specifically the development of agriculture, led to significant soil degradation. The prolonged use of plows and the removal of organic matter from the soil led to the depletion of soil nutrients. Additionally, the widespread use of herbicides and pesticides led to a loss of soil biodiversity. The loss of woodland cover also led to increased soil erosion, as trees help to bind the soil together.
Upland Regions
In upland areas, human activity, specifically grazing, had the opposite effect on soil quality. The movement of grazing animals helped to fertilize the soil, leading to a buildup of nutrients. However, overgrazing led to a decline in soil health as the soil was compacted by the movement of animals. The loss of woodland cover also led to increased soil erosion.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the development of Man during Neolithic to the Iron Age had a significant impact on the vegetation of the British Isles. The shift from woodland to open heathland and grassland formations resulted in a loss of biodiversity and an increase in soil erosion. The widespread development of agriculture and the use of metal tools led to significant soil degradation, with lowland regions being particularly affected. Finally, it was found that upland regions were positively impacted by grazing, with grazing animals leading to soil fertilization. However, this was only sustainable to a certain extent due to overgrazing, which led to a decline in soil health. Overall, Man had a significant influence on the pedogenesis of the British Isles during this time period.
