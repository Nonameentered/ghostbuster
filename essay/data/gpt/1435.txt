George Eliot’s Adam Bede is a novel that explores the lives of the rural poor in England during the 19th century. One of the central themes of the novel is the category of the outsider, a theme that Eliot brings to life through her skilled use of literary methods and intellectual tropes. In this essay, I will explore how Eliot explores the category of the outsider in Adam Bede, and what literary methods and intellectual tropes she uses to highlight this theme.
The first outsider that we encounter in Adam Bede is Arthur Donnithorne, the wealthy young heir of the local estate. Arthur is an outsider in that he does not belong to the rural community of Hayslope, and he is also an outsider in the sense that he does not conform to the cultural norms of the rural community. Arthur is portrayed as an elegant and sophisticated young man who is out of place amidst the rustic simplicity of Hayslope. Eliot introduces Arthur as a character who is distant from the people around him and who does not understand their way of life. For example, Arthur is baffled by the simplicity of his Aunt Lydia’s cottage, which he describes as “a sort of nun’s cell” (Eliot, Adam Bede, ch. 2). Arthur’s privileged upbringing has left him disconnected from the everyday realities of the rural poor, and he struggles to understand their values and beliefs.
Another way in which Eliot explores the theme of the outsider in Adam Bede is through the character of Hetty Sorrel, a young woman who comes from a poor family in Hayslope. Hetty is an outsider in the sense that she is ambitious and seeks to escape the poverty and drudgery of her life. She dreams of marrying a wealthy man who will elevate her social status and offer her a life of luxury and comfort. However, Hetty is also an outsider in the sense that she does not fit in with the values and expectations of the rural community. She is portrayed as vain and superficial, obsessed with her own beauty and resentful of those around her who do not appreciate it.
Eliot uses a range of literary methods to highlight the theme of the outsider in Adam Bede. One of the most effective of these is her use of dialect and vernacular language to create a sense of place and to distinguish the rural community from the outsiders who visit Hayslope. Eliot uses a range of dialects to capture the distinctive voices and idioms of each character, from Adam Bede’s rough and earthy speech to Arthur Donnithorne’s more refined and formal language. By doing so, she creates a rich and vivid portrait of the rural community and reinforces the sense of separation between the locals and the outsiders.
Another literary method that Eliot uses to explore the theme of the outsider is her use of irony and satire. Eliot frequently employs irony to draw attention to the cultural differences between the rural community of Hayslope and the outsiders who visit or live there. For example, when Arthur Donnithorne arrives in Hayslope, he is quickly caught up in the romantic and sentimental atmosphere of the village, despite the fact that he professes to be a more sophisticated and worldly young man. Eliot uses irony to highlight the absurdity of Arthur’s claims to superiority and his apparent lack of self-awareness.
Intellectual tropes are also central to Eliot’s exploration of the theme of the outsider in Adam Bede. One of the most prominent of these is her use of the concept of moral responsibility to critique the actions of the characters who are outsiders to the rural community of Hayslope. For example, Arthur Donnithorne is held morally responsible for his actions towards Hetty Sorrel, even though he is not a member of the rural community. Eliot argues that Arthur’s privileged upbringing and his distance from the daily struggles of the rural poor do not absolve him of his moral duties and responsibilities towards those around him.
Eliot also explores the theme of the outsider through her use of the concept of “otherness.” The idea of otherness is a central theme in Adam Bede, as Eliot portrays the rural community of Hayslope as a close-knit and self-contained community that is wary of outsiders. This is most evident in the treatment of Hetty Sorrel, who is seen as an outsider from the moment she arrives in Hayslope. Hetty’s desire to escape her poverty and her determination to marry above her station make her an object of suspicion and contempt among the rural community. Eliot uses this tension between the outsiders and the locals to explore the theme of otherness and to illuminate the cultural and social divisions that existed in rural England during the 19th century.
In conclusion, George Eliot explores the category of the outsider in Adam Bede through her skilled use of literary methods and intellectual tropes. Through the character of Arthur Donnithorne and the concept of moral responsibility, Eliot highlights the difference between the rural community of Hayslope and the outsiders who come into their midst. Through the character of Hetty Sorrel and the concept of otherness, Eliot illuminates the social and cultural tensions that existed in rural England during the 19th century. By using dialect, irony, and satire, Eliot creates a vivid and realistic portrait of the rural community and underscores the sense of separation between the locals and the outsiders. All of these elements combine to make Adam Bede a powerful exploration of the theme of the outsider and an enduring masterpiece of English literature.
