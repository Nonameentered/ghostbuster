The aggregate supply (AS) curve is an essential component of economic models that illustrates the relationship between the price level of goods and services and the total amount of output produced in the economy. The shape of the AS curve indicates the level of output needed to meet the demand for goods and services at a particular price level. The Classical, Keynesian, and New Keynesian models have different assumptions and restrictions that lead to the formation of different AS curves. This essay discusses how the AS curve differs in each of these models and how government fiscal and monetary policies impact output, prices, and employment in each model.
Classical Model
The Classical model is based on the premise that markets are self-correcting, and any imbalances are temporary. The model assumes that prices are flexible, and the economy is always in equilibrium. This means that if there is a shortage of goods in the market, the price of goods will increase, incentivizing firms to increase production, thus restoring equilibrium. The Classical model also assumes that resources are fully employed, and there is no relation between unemployment and inflation.
The aggregate supply curve in the Classical model is vertical, which indicates that changes in the price level have no impact on the supply of goods and services. The output level is determined solely by the available supply of the factors of production, such as labor and capital. Any increase in the money supply will only cause a proportional increase in the price level, leaving the output level unaffected.
Fiscal and monetary policies have limited impact on output, prices, and employment in the Classical model. Fiscal policies that involve increases in government spending or tax cuts will cause an increase in demand but will not affect output levels since the AS curve is vertical. Similarly, monetary policies such as changes in interest rates or the money supply will only lead to changes in prices but will not influence the level of output. This is because changes in aggregate demand (AD) will not lead to changes in the level of output since the economy is always in equilibrium.
Keynesian Model
The Keynesian model is based on the idea that markets are not always in equilibrium and that the level of output is influenced by aggregate demand. Keynesian economics emphasizes the role of government intervention in stabilizing the economy during periods of recession or inflation. The model assumes that prices are sticky in the short run, and that firms cannot adjust prices quickly to changes in demand or supply shocks. It also assumes that resources are not always fully employed, and changes in aggregate demand can lead to changes in output and employment.
The aggregate supply curve in the Keynesian model is horizontal or positively sloped, indicating that the level of output can increase without a corresponding increase in prices. This occurs when there are idle resources in the economy, and firms can increase output without raising prices. However, as the level of output increases, firms will have to hire more workers, pushing up wages and production costs. This will cause the AS curve to shift upwards, leading to an increase in prices.
Government fiscal policies impact output, prices, and employment in the Keynesian model. An increase in government spending or a tax cut will increase aggregate demand, leading to an increase in output and employment. This is known as the fiscal multiplier effect since the increase in government spending has a multiplier effect on overall output. Similarly, monetary policies such as a reduction in interest rates or an increase in the money supply will increase aggregate demand, leading to an increase in output and employment.
 New Keynesian Model
The New Keynesian model is an extension of the Keynesian model that incorporates rational expectations and price rigidities. The model assumes that firms are forward-looking and can adjust prices in response to changes in demand and supply shocks. It assumes that the price level is sticky in the short run, but firms can gradually adjust prices in response to changes in demand and supply.
The aggregate supply curve in the New Keynesian model is upward sloping and flat in the short run, indicating that the level of output can increase without an increase in prices. The flat portion of the curve occurs when firms are unable to adjust prices rapidly in response to changes in demand and supply. However, as the level of output increases, firms will adjust prices, leading to an upward-sloping AS curve.
Government fiscal and monetary policies impact output, prices, and employment in the New Keynesian model. Fiscal policies that increase government spending or reduce taxes will increase aggregate demand and output, consistent with the Keynesian multiplier effect. However, the impact of monetary policy may not be as strong. This is because, in the New Keynesian model, changes in monetary policy affect expectations about future inflation. Thus, if the central bank unexpectedly raises interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, it may lead to an increase in output and employment in the short run, but as firms gradually adjust prices, output and employment may decline in the long run.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the aggregate supply curve is an essential component of economic models that illustrates the relationship between the price level of goods and services and the total amount of output produced in the economy. The shape of the AS curve differs in the Classical, Keynesian, and New Keynesian models due to different assumptions and restrictions. In the Classical model, the AS curve is vertical, indicating that changes in the price level do not affect the supply of goods and services. In the Keynesian model, the AS curve is horizontal or positively sloped, indicating that the level of output can increase without an increase in prices. In the New Keynesian model, the AS curve is upward sloping and flat in the short run, indicating that the level of output can increase without an increase in prices.
Government fiscal and monetary policies impact output, prices, and employment in different ways in each model. In the Classical model, fiscal and monetary policies have limited impact on output, prices, and employment. In the Keynesian model, government intervention through fiscal and monetary policies can stabilize the economy during periods of recession or inflation. In the New Keynesian model, fiscal policies can increase output and employment, while monetary policies may be less effective due to the impact on inflation expectations. Understanding the differences in the AS curve and their impact on the economy is essential for policymakers in formulating appropriate economic policies.
