Mauritius is an island country located in the Indian Ocean, known for its beautiful beaches and diverse culture. The country primarily relies on the agriculture sector for its economic development, where it produces crops such as sugar, tea, fruits, and vegetables. From the 1970s to the 2000s, Mauritius implemented several agricultural development strategies that aimed to improve production and diversify agricultural activities in the country. This essay aims to evaluate Mauritius' agricultural development strategy between 1970-2000, its underlying paradigms, and outcomes.
The agriculture sector of Mauritius faced many challenges such as small land sizes, soil erosion, and climate variability. However, the Mauritian government recognized the potential of this sector to drive economic growth and development. In the 1970s, the government implemented a strategy to increase the production of sugarcane, which was a dominant cash crop, by introducing high-yielding varieties of sugarcane. This strategy worked as the production of sugarcane increased from 375,000 tons in 1970 to 519,000 tons in 1980.
The underlying paradigm of this strategy was the Green Revolution, which aimed to introduce modern agricultural technologies to increase food production in developing countries. The Green Revolution introduced high-yielding varieties of crops, mechanization, and chemical fertilizers and pesticides to improve agricultural production. Mauritius adopted this paradigm to improve the production of sugarcane by introducing high-yielding techniques and hybrid seeds.
However, the Green Revolution paradigm also led to negative outcomes such as environmental degradation and soil degradation. The heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides resulted in soil degradation, increased water pollution, and reduced soil fertility. The sugar industry was also criticized for environmental pollution as it produced harmful by-products such as bagasse and molasses.
In the mid-1980s, Mauritius shifted its agricultural development strategy to diversify agricultural activities in the country. The country aimed to reduce its reliance on sugarcane by developing other crops such as tea, vegetables, and fruits. The government provided subsidies to farmers to encourage the cultivation of these crops and also invested in research and development to improve production.
The underlying paradigm of this strategy was sustainable development, which aimed to achieve economic growth without compromising the environment. The sustainable development paradigm emphasized the need for the agriculture sector to be sustainable by promoting crop diversification, integrated pest management, and sustainable land use. Through this paradigm, Mauritius focused on diversifying its agricultural activities while also addressing environmental and social issues.
The outcomes of the diversification strategy were positive as the country was able to reduce its reliance on sugarcane. The production of other crops such as fruits, vegetables, and tea increased, leading to improved food security, employment, and income diversification. The government also focused on developing the agro-processing industry, which added value to agricultural products and created employment opportunities.
However, the diversification strategy also had some negative outcomes as it created competition for land use, leading to deforestation, soil erosion, and reduced biodiversity. The introduction of foreign species to cultivate these crops also led to invasive species, which had negative impacts on the environment. The agro-processing industry also faced criticism for its negative impact on the environment as it produced waste products.
In the 1990s, Mauritius implemented another agricultural development strategy to improve productivity by improving the quality of human capital. The government invested in improving the skills of farmers through training programs and provided access to credit facilities to promote entrepreneurship.
The underlying paradigm of this strategy was human capital development, which emphasized the need for investment in education and training to improve productivity and economic growth. Through this paradigm, Mauritius focused on improving the skills of farmers to promote entrepreneurship in the agriculture sector.
The outcomes of this strategy were positive as it improved the quality of human capital in the agriculture sector. Farmers were able to access credit facilities, which improved their ability to invest in agriculture. The training programs also improved the skills of farmers, leading to increased productivity and profitability. The agriculture sector also became more diversified as farmers were encouraged to invest in other crops.
In conclusion, Mauritius implemented several agricultural development strategies between 1970-2000, which aimed to improve production and diversify agricultural activities in the country. The strategies were based on different paradigms, including the Green Revolution, sustainable development, and human capital development. The outcomes of these strategies were both positive and negative, with positive outcomes such as improved food security, employment, and income diversification, and negative outcomes such as environmental degradation, soil degradation, and competition for land use. Overall, Mauritius' agricultural development strategy between 1970-2000 was successful as it improved the country's economic growth and development.
