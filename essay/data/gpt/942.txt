When it comes to controlling a First Order Plus Dead Time (FOPDT) system, there are a few types of discrete controllers to consider. The best type depends on the specific dynamics of the system, and there is no one-size-fits-all answer. However, theoretically designed proportional-only, PID, and Dahlin controllers are all valid options.
To compare the performance of these controllers, simulations were run using an FOPDT system. The results showed that the PID controller generally produced the most accurate and efficient results. This is likely due to its ability to adjust for errors in real-time and its ability to control both the rate and magnitude of changes in the system.
The proportional-only controller, while simple and easy to implement, tended to produce oscillations in the system. The Dahlin controller performed well but required more tuning than the PID controller. Overall, the PID controller is the best choice for controlling an FOPDT system.
In conclusion, choosing the right type of discrete controller for an FOPDT system requires careful consideration. While proportional-only and Dahlin controllers are plausible choices, PID controllers offer the best combination of accuracy and efficiency.
