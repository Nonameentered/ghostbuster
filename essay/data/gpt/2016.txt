Acid-base titration is a commonly used analytical technique to determine the concentration of an acid or base. The objective of an acid-base titration is to accurately measure the concentration of the unknown acidic or basic solution by adding a known amount of a potent alkaline or acidic solution. The process involves monitoring the pH changes in the solution as the neutralization reaction occurs.
In determining the total acid concentration in vinegar, an acid-base titration is used to determine the amount of acetic acid in the solution. Acetic acid, the main acid component in vinegar, reacts with a strong base, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), to produce sodium acetate and water, as shown in the equation below:
CH3COOH + NaOH â†’ CH3COONa + H2O
To accurately determine the endpoint of the titration and hence the concentration of the acetic acid present in the vinegar sample, a suitable indicator is used. In this particular titration, phenolphthalein is usually added to the solution. Phenolphthalein is a weak organic acid that changes color at a specific range of pH values. It is pink in its basic form and colorless in its acidic form. When the NaOH solution has reacted with enough acetic acid present in the vinegar solution, the acidity of the vinegar will be neutralized, and the pH will increase beyond the range that phenolphthalein changes from pink to colorless.
Before using the NaOH solution for the titration, it must be prepared and standardized. Standardizing the NaOH solution involves accurately measuring a known quantity of an acid, such as hydrochloric acid, and using the same process as the titration to determine its precise concentration. This allows a reference point of the NaOH solution for use in the titration process.
In conducting the titration, the vinegar sample first needs to be accurately measured and diluted with distilled water. This ensures that the concentration of the acetic acid sample used in the titration is within the titratable range. The diluted vinegar sample is then titrated slowly with the standard NaOH solution, using a burette, while the mixture is stirred continuously. The endpoint of the titration is usually a sharp change in the color of the phenolphthalein from pink to colorless. The volume of NaOH solution used to reach the endpoint is recorded.
The concentration of acetic acid in the vinegar sample is then determined by using the balanced chemical equation above and stoichiometry principles. Knowing the molarity of the NaOH solution and the volume of NaOH used in the titration, the moles of NaOH can be calculated. Using the balanced equation, the moles of acetic acid in the vinegar sample can then be calculated, allowing for the determination of the concentration of acetic acid in the sample.
Additionally, pH paper and barium chloride and silver nitrate solutions can be used to determine the other properties of the vinegar samples. pH paper determines the acidic or basic properties of the vinegar solution. The paper changes color to indicate the acidity or basicity levels.
Barium chloride solution tests for the presence of sulfate ions in the vinegar sample, while silver nitrate solution is used to determine the concentration of chloride ions in the vinegar sample. The silver ions react with chloride ions in the vinegar to form silver chloride, which is insoluble in water and forms a white precipitate. Similarly, barium ions react with sulfate ions in the vinegar sample to form barium sulfate, which is also insoluble in water and forms a white precipitate.
In conclusion, acid-base titration is a vital laboratory technique used in measuring the concentration of an acid or base in a sample mixture. In determining the total acid concentration in vinegar, the process involves titrating a sample of vinegar with a standard NaOH solution, with phenolphthalein used as the indicator. By knowing the volume of the standard NaOH solution used and the stoichiometry of the reaction, the concentration of acetic acid in the vinegar sample can be calculated. Additional tests may be conducted, such as pH paper and barium chloride and silver nitrate solutions, to determine the other properties of the vinegar sample.
