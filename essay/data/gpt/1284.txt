The Tudor era was a time of great change and upheaval for England. During this period, London was one of the most important and bustling cities in the world, yet it also faced numerous challenges. The city was plagued by disease, overcrowding, social inequality and the presence of many foreigners, or “aliens” as they were known. Despite these issues, smaller organisations such as companies played an important role in maintaining order in Tudor London, and worked together with the government to help keep the city under control.
One of the main ways that companies helped maintain stability in Tudor London was by ensuring that their members adhered to strict codes of behaviour. These codes were designed to ensure that individuals acted in a civil and orderly manner, and that they did not engage in activities that could lead to unrest or disorder. For example, the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors, a guild of tailors, had strict rules about the quality of garments that could be produced, as well as how they were to be priced and sold. This helped to prevent the spread of inferior or faulty goods, which could have led to dissatisfaction among customers and potentially even riots.
Another way that companies helped to maintain order in Tudor London was by working closely with the government to implement new laws and regulations. For example, many companies played an active role in the enforcement of sumptuary laws, which were designed to regulate what people could wear based on their social class. This helped to prevent the kind of excess and ostentation that could lead to unrest and dissatisfaction among the lower classes.
Companies also played an important role in the provision of charitable donations and services to the poorest members of society. This could include providing food, shelter, and medical care to those in need, as well as funding the construction of new schools and hospitals. By doing so, companies were able to help prevent the spread of disease and provide support to those who might otherwise be forgotten by the government.
Overall, the efforts of smaller organisations such as companies were very effective in controlling the various problems that London faced during the Tudor period. However, they were not without their limitations. For example, some companies were only open to those who had already achieved a certain level of success and wealth, which meant that they were not always able to reach the poorest members of society.
Despite these limitations, the efforts of companies were highly complementary to those of the government in maintaining order and stability in Tudor London. The government had a wider sphere of influence and was able to enforce laws and regulations on a larger scale, while companies were able to provide more personalised services to their members and those in their local communities. Together, these two groups worked to create a system of checks and balances that helped to ensure that London remained a relatively stable and prosperous city in the face of numerous challenges.
