Hospitality is a wide term that can be applied to various settings, including social, private, and commercial hospitality. Hospitality is defined as the generous and cordial host behavior toward guests. The extent to which commercial hosts need to offer genuine hospitality to guests is a complex issue with multiple perspectives. Some argue that commercial establishments are in business to make profits, and therefore, genuine hospitality is not a must. Others hold the perspective that commercial establishments should prioritize customer satisfaction. This essay discusses the differences between social, private, and commercial hospitality and the criteria necessary for successful hospitality in each, followed by an analysis of opposing views on whether or not commercial hospitality can or should offer genuine hospitality to guests, and finally, a discussion of the role of employee training and attitudes towards customer satisfaction.
Social hospitality involves the reception of visitors and guests in one's home, with the goal of making them feel welcome and comfortable. This type of hospitality is usually driven by a personal relationship between host and guest. As such, social hospitality involves offering guests a place to stay, food, and drink, and creating a warm and welcoming environment. The criterion for successful social hospitality is the creation of an environment that fosters comfort and ease.
On the other hand, private hospitality is a step up from social hospitality. This type of hospitality is offered in high-end establishments such as five-star hotels. Private hospitality involves creating an atmosphere of luxury and opulence, where guests are pampered and treated to personalized services. The criteria for successful private hospitality is the creation of an ambiance of luxury, elegance, and sophistication.
Commercial hospitality is geared towards offering services or products in exchange for payment. This type of hospitality involves the provision of food, drink, accommodation, transportation, or entertainment to clients or customers. The primary goal of commercial hospitality is to create a comfortable and enjoyable experience for guests. Criteria for successful commercial hospitality can be measured in the level of customer satisfaction, as measured by feedback or reviews.
Opposing views have emerged on whether commercial hospitality can or should offer genuine hospitality to guests. Some maintain that commercial hosts should prioritize profits and regard genuine hospitality as unnecessary. According to this view, genuine hospitality can be offered voluntarily, but a lack of it would not negatively impact success. Furthermore, it is argued that customers are unlikely to be in a position to demand absolute hospitality, considering that business thrives on meeting human needs and desires.
However, others hold the position that commercial hosts need to offer genuine hospitality to guests. According to this view, genuine hospitality is essential in creating customer satisfaction, which is crucial for business success. Genuine hospitality allows guests to feel valued and cared for, translating to loyalty, repeat custom, and positive references. Moreover, genuine hospitality makes commercial establishments stand out from the competition, attracting new customers and boosting profits.
Employee training and attitudes towards customer satisfaction are critical in commercial hospitality. Training employees is essential in ensuring that guests receive quality service. The right attitude towards customer satisfaction will enhance employee behavior as they interact with guests. Customer satisfaction begins with a warm welcome, prompt service delivery, attention to guest preferences, and creating an ambiance that sets apart the establishment from competitors.
Historically, the concept of hospitality dates back to biblical times when Abraham, Sarah, and Lot offered hospitality to three travelers who appeared at their tent (Genesis 18). In many cultures, hospitality is considered sacred, rooted in duty and respect for human dignity. For example, in India, the concept of "Atithi Devo Bhava" translates to "Guests are equivalent to God." Thus, it is not uncommon to find hospitality extended in unexpected places such as along highways and railway stations.
In conclusion, genuine hospitality entails creating an atmosphere of warmth and comfort to guests, regardless of the hospitality situation, be it social, private, or commercial. Successful hospitality is anchored in specific criteria such as creating an ambiance of luxury and elegance, providing personalized services to guests, and customer satisfaction. While some argue that commercial hospitality need not prioritize genuine hospitality, others assert that genuine hospitality is crucial to business success. Finally, employee training and attitudes towards customer satisfaction are critical drivers of successful hospitality. In essence, genuine hospitality should be practiced in every hospitality setting, given its historical and cultural importance in human relationships.
