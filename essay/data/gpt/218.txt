The European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) guarantees fundamental rights and freedoms to all individuals within its jurisdiction. When it comes to the retention of fingerprints, DNA samples, and profiles, there are concerns that it may infringe on some of these rights. In this essay, we will examine whether or not the retention of fingerprints, DNA samples, and profiles is in accordance with the ECHR.
Before we dive into the specifics, it's important to understand what we mean by the retention of fingerprints, DNA samples, and profiles. These are all forms of biometric data that can be collected from a person. Fingerprints are taken by pressing a finger onto a scanner, DNA samples are usually taken from a cheek swab, and profiles are generated from the analysis of this biometric data. In some cases, this data may be retained by law enforcement agencies, even if the individual it was taken from has not been convicted of a crime.
One of the primary concerns with the retention of biometric data is that it may violate an individual's right to privacy. Article 8 of the ECHR states that everyone has the right to respect for their private and family life, their home, and their correspondence. This includes the right to control the collection, retention, and use of data that pertains to them. However, there are also exceptions to this right. For instance, it may be necessary to retain biometric data in the interests of national security or public safety.
In the UK, there is a system in place known as the National DNA Database (NDNAD). This database was established in 1995, and it contains the DNA profiles of over 5 million people, many of whom have never been convicted of a crime. This has led to concerns that the UK is violating Article 8 of the ECHR by retaining the biometric data of innocent individuals. However, the UK government has argued that the NDNAD is necessary to help solve crimes and protect the public.
The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has weighed in on this issue in a number of cases. In 2008, the court ruled in S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom that the indiscriminate retention of DNA samples and profiles of people who had not been convicted of a crime was a violation of Article 8 of the ECHR. The court held that the retention of such data should be subject to strict safeguards.
In response to this ruling, the UK government introduced new legislation in 2012 that placed a time limit on the retention of biometric data. This means that the biometric data of individuals who have not been convicted of a crime must be deleted after a certain period of time. The legislation also introduced additional safeguards to protect the privacy of individuals, such as the requirement for judicial authorization before biometric data can be retained.
The retention of biometric data can also raise issues with regards to an individual's right to a fair trial. Article 6 of the ECHR guarantees the right to a fair trial, including the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. However, the retention of biometric data could be used to unfairly influence a trial by suggesting that the individual is guilty before any evidence has been presented.
In 2012, the ECtHR ruled in the case of Al-Khawaja and Tahery v. the United Kingdom that the retention of biometric data could be used as evidence in a trial, but only if it was obtained and retained in a manner that was consistent with Article 6 of the ECHR. This means that the data must be obtained lawfully and not in violation of an individual's right to privacy.
In conclusion, the retention of fingerprints, DNA samples, and profiles is a complex issue that raises concerns about privacy and the right to a fair trial. While the indiscriminate retention of biometric data of innocent individuals is a violation of Article 8 of the ECHR, there are exceptions to this right in the interests of public safety and national security. The ECtHR has ruled that the retention of biometric data must be subject to strict safeguards, and that it can only be used in court if it has been obtained and retained lawfully. Ultimately, the balance between the right to privacy and the public interest must be carefully considered in order to ensure that the retention of biometric data is in accordance with the ECHR.
