Introduction
Strain gauges are sensing devices used to measure the strain or deformation of an object subjected to an external force. The objective of the experiment using strain gauge is to measure the mechanical strain produced by the deformation of the object, and to convert it into a measurable electrical signal. The obtained results are then used to analyze the structural integrity of various materials and to design more robust and reliable structures. 
Measurement sensitivity is a critical parameter in strain gauge measurement. It refers to the smallest electrical signal that can be detected by the circuitry and the accuracy of the measurement. Several factors must be taken into account, including noise level, linear relationship between system output and loading force, and system stability. 
The Wheatstone bridge circuit is a common circuit used in strain gauge experiments, and it helps to measure the changes in electrical resistance of the strain gauge. The theoretical balance condition of the Wheatstone bridge circuit is the point at which the output voltage is zero. This is achieved by matching the resistances of the four arms of the Wheatstone bridge circuit, which ensures that the signal voltage is sensitive only to changes in the resistance of the strain gauge. 
The output voltage of the Wheatstone bridge circuit is proportional to the applied force. The linear relationship between the system output and loading force is described by the sensitivity factor. The sensitivity of a force sensor is defined as the ratio of output voltage to applied force, and it is typically expressed in units of volts per Newton.
Noise reduction is an important consideration in strain gauge measurements. Several methods can be used to reduce noise levels, including shielding, grounding, filtering, and signal averaging. The force sensor's sensitivity can be increased by using higher gain amplifiers, reducing the input impedance of the amplifier, and increasing the number of active elements in the Wheatstone bridge circuit. 
Feedback capacitors are commonly used in Wheatstone bridge circuits to reduce noise levels, and their effect on the output voltage is analyzed in this paper. In this essay, we will analyze the objectives of the experiment using strain gauge, measurement sensitivity, the theoretical balance condition of the Wheatstone bridge circuit, the linear relationship between system output and loading force, and how noise level can be reduced. Additionally, a comparison of the system output with and without feedback capacitor when there is no applied force and when a force is applied to the system will be conducted.
The Objective of the Experiment using Strain Gauge
The objective of the experiment using strain gauge is to measure the mechanical strain produced by the deformation of the object and to convert it into a measurable electrical signal. The obtained results are then used to analyze the structural integrity of various materials and to design more robust and reliable structures. Strain gauges are used in a wide range of applications, including civil engineering, aerospace, and mechanical engineering. 
In civil engineering, strain gauges are used to measure the deformation of bridges, dams, and other structures. These measurements help to analyze the structural integrity of the structures and to detect any potential failure points. In aerospace, strain gauges are used to measure the deformation of aircraft wings, fuselages, and other structural components. These measurements help to ensure that the aircraft is structurally sound and can withstand the forces of flight. 
Measurement Sensitivity
Measurement sensitivity is a critical parameter in strain gauge measurement. It refers to the smallest electrical signal that can be detected by the circuitry and the accuracy of the measurement. The sensitivity of a force sensor is defined as the ratio of output voltage to applied force and is typically expressed in units of volts per Newton. 
Measurement sensitivity affects the accuracy of the measurement and affects the signal-to-noise ratio of the system. The lower the measurement sensitivity, the more difficult it is to detect small changes in the output voltage, resulting in less accurate measurement. It is, therefore, important to determine the required sensitivity before designing the strain gauge system. 
Factors that should be taken into account when designing a strain gauge system include the input impedance of the amplifier, the sensitivity of the force sensor, and the linear relationship between system output and loading force. Noise level is another important factor that should be taken into account when designing a strain gauge system.
The Theoretical Balance Condition of the Wheatstone Bridge Circuit
The Wheatstone bridge circuit is a common circuit used in strain gauge experiments, and it helps to measure the changes in electrical resistance of the strain gauge. The Wheatstone bridge circuit consists of four resistors arranged in a diamond shape, with the strain gauge in one of the arms. 
The theoretical balance condition of the Wheatstone bridge circuit is the point at which the output voltage is zero. This is achieved by matching the resistances of the four arms of the Wheatstone bridge circuit, which ensures that the signal voltage is sensitive only to changes in the resistance of the strain gauge. Any changes in the resistance of the other arms of the Wheatstone bridge circuit are canceled out by the differential amplifier.
When the Wheatstone bridge circuit is balanced, the output voltage across the differential amplifier is zero. The output voltage can be calculated as the product of the gain of the differential amplifier and the voltage difference between the two input terminals. If the Wheatstone bridge circuit is balanced, the product of the gain of the differential amplifier and the voltage difference between the two input terminals is zero. 
The Linear Relationship between System Output and Loading Force
The output voltage of the Wheatstone bridge circuit is proportional to the applied force. The linear relationship between the system output and loading force is described by the sensitivity factor. The sensitivity factor is defined as the ratio of output voltage to applied force and is typically expressed in units of volts per Newton. 
There is a linear relationship between the output voltage of the Wheatstone bridge circuit and the applied force. This linear relationship can be expressed as:
Vout = S x F 
Where Vout is the output voltage of the Wheatstone bridge circuit, S is the sensitivity factor, and F is the applied force. The sensitivity factor is determined by the gain of the differential amplifier and the electrical resistance of the Wheatstone bridge circuit. 
Noise Reduction
Noise reduction is an important consideration in strain gauge measurements. Several methods can be used to reduce noise levels. One method is shielding, which involves enclosing the strain gauge system in a grounded metal enclosure to prevent the entry of external electromagnetic interference. Another method is grounding, which involves connecting the signal ground to the chassis ground to reduce the common-mode voltage and to improve signal-to-noise ratio. 
Filtering is another method used to reduce noise levels. The most common filters used in strain gauge systems are low-pass filters, which attenuate high-frequency noise while passing low-frequency signals. Signal averaging is another method used to reduce noise levels. It involves plotting the average of a series of measurements, which helps to eliminate random fluctuations and to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.
The Sensitivity of the Force Sensor
The sensitivity of a force sensor is defined as the ratio of output voltage to applied force and is typically expressed in units of volts per Newton. The sensitivity of the force sensor is affected by several factors, including the input impedance of the amplifier, the linear relationship between system output and loading force, and the circuit stability. 
The input impedance of the amplifier affects the sensitivity of the force sensor. The higher the amplifier's input impedance, the less current flows through the Wheatstone bridge circuit and, therefore, the higher the sensitivity of the force sensor. The linear relationship between system output and loading force is another factor that affects the sensitivity of the force sensor. If this relationship is non-linear, the sensitivity of the force sensor is reduced, resulting in less accurate measurement.
Comparing System Output with and without Feedback Capacitor
Feedback capacitors are commonly used in Wheatstone bridge circuits to reduce noise levels. The feedback capacitor is connected across the amplifier's feedback resistor, forming a low-pass filter that attenuates high-frequency noise. The effect of feedback capacitors on the output voltage can be analyzed by comparing the system output with and without the feedback capacitor when there is no applied force and when a force is applied to the system.
When there is no applied force, the output voltage of the Wheatstone bridge circuit is zero, and the feedback capacitor has no effect on the output voltage. However, when a force is applied to the system, the output voltage of the Wheatstone bridge circuit increases. The effect of feedback capacitor on the output voltage depends on the frequency of the noise source. At low frequencies, the feedback capacitor has a negligible effect on the output voltage, whereas at high frequencies, the feedback capacitor significantly reduces the output voltage.
