Thermometers are an instrument used to measure temperature. However, there are different types of thermometers with different characteristics. In this essay, we will be comparing two types of thermometers: platinum film and thermistor thermometers in terms of their sensitivity, resolution, and suitability for meteorological applications. Furthermore, we will look into the calibration process of these instruments and its resultant impact.
Firstly, sensitivity refers to the smallest detectable change in temperature. A platinum film thermometer is more sensitive than a thermistor thermometer. Platinum film thermometers have sensitivity in the range of tenths to thousands of a degree Celsius. On the other hand, thermistor thermometers have a sensitivity of tenths to a few degrees Celsius. This disparity in sensitivity, therefore, means that platinum film thermometers are more capable of detecting small temperature changes making them a more accurate instrument.
Secondly, resolution is the smallest increment of measurable temperature change. Platinum film thermometers have a higher resolution than thermistor thermometers. Their higher sensitivity means that they can detect smaller temperature changes per unit of measurement, allowing for more precise readings. Furthermore, platinum film thermometers are resistant to drift, meaning that they retain their calibration accuracy over a longer period. In contrast, thermistor thermometers tend to drift, which can reduce their long-term accuracy.
Thirdly, meteorological applications require temperature measurement under various circumstances. In terms of suitability, there’s a significant difference between the platinum film thermometer and thermistor thermometer. Platinum film thermometers are suitable for measuring extremely low temperatures, usually below -82°C. On the other hand, thermistor thermometers are useful for analyzing temperatures between -50°C and +150°C. Therefore, meteorologists would be wise in considering the temperature range needed to make an accurate measurement before picking the instrument that is best suited for their application.
In terms of calibration, both platinum film and thermistor thermometers employ different methods, but they both require calibration to retain their accuracy. Platinum film thermometers are calibrated using a comparative method. They are placed in contact with a secondary standard, frequently a platinum resistance thermometer, which has already been calibrated against a primary standard. By assessing the thermometers’ temperature differences’ response in comparison to the secondary platinum thermometer’s response provides accuracy of the thermometer. Conversely, Thermistor thermometers are calibrated by using a characteristic curve. The relationship between known reference temperatures and corresponding electrical resistance is plotted to form a curve, and the thermistor thermometer is calibrated according to the curve. The calibration results for each thermometer differ based on the calibration procedure, but Calibration results show that platinum film thermometers exhibit higher accuracy.
In conclusion, platinum film and thermistor thermometers are both instruments for measuring temperature with subtle differences. The significant differences are in their sensitivity, resolution, and suitability for specific meteorological applications. Platinum film thermometers are more sensitive, have higher resolution, and are suitable for measuring low temperatures. Thermistor thermometers are more appropriate for monitoring temperatures over a broader range of temperatures. Calibration results saw platinum film thermometers exhibiting higher accuracy. Careful selection of the instrument based on sensitivity, resolution, and temperature range requirements is necessary, especially given that depending on application accuracy requirements, various analytical tools that achieve the most satisfactory result will be selected.
