Introduction
The Oriental Star, a buffet restaurant, is a popular destination for those who love to indulge in a variety of cuisines. With its excellent location, affordable prices, and high-quality food, it has managed to retain a steady clientele. However, the service quality of the restaurant is not up to the mark, which can potentially harm its reputation and business. In this essay, we will analyze and evaluate The Oriental Starâ€™s service quality and provide recommendations for improvement, along with a critique of techniques used.
Analysis
The buffet restaurant experience is largely dependent on quality service by the staff. The Oriental Star has a strong and efficient team, but there are areas where they need to improve. The staff is polite and friendly, but they tend to be less attentive during peak hours or when there is a surge in customer volume. This has led to several complaints from customers that their orders were not attended to promptly.
The Oriental Star has recently introduced an order-and-pay-at-the-table option to minimize order-taking and queuing time, which is a good move. However, the virtual menu and ordering system could be improved to make ordering more seamless and easy. Some customers find the ordering system confusing and not user-friendly, which can lead to frustration and dissatisfaction.
Additionally, the seating arrangement needs improvement. There is a lack of adequate seating options for larger groups, with limited options for privacy or intimate dining. This can lead to overcrowding, which further fuels complaints from customers.
The Oriental Star has received several complaints about food quality, such as cold food or food that has been sitting out for too long. Buffets require consistent attention to ensure that food is continuously fresh and warm. Ensuring this requires reheating sections appropriately and regularly filling sections. A lack of attention in this regard can lead to dissatisfaction among customers.
Recommendations
To improve service quality, The Oriental Star can implement a few strategies, such as:
1. Providing staff training services: Staff training is integral to any service operation. Proper training can ensure high-quality service consistently and promote efficiency. This could include training in table service, customer handling, time management, communication skills, and more. Additionally, staff should be given incentives to improve their performance.
2. Improving the ordering system: The Oriental Star can improve the virtual menu and ordering system to make it more user-friendly for customers. Customers should be able to order their food quickly and without confusion.
3. Redesigning the layout: The Oriental Star can also redesign its layout to cater for larger groups and provide more options for privacy and intimacy.
4. Frequent food collection and Serving: A team should be put in place for regularly collecting and serving food to ensure freshness and quality consistently.
Evaluating Techniques Used
The Oriental Star has incorporated several techniques to improve its service quality, such as order-and-pay-at-the-table and food labeling. While these strategies are useful and forward-thinking, they have some drawbacks that need attention.
The order-and-pay-at-the-table option is a convenient way for customers to pay without standing in long queues. However, it may not work for some customers who are not tech-savvy or do not have access to a smartphone. This option may work better for the younger generation and may not be suitable for all customers. Therefore, the restaurant should provide alternative payment options for those who prefer conventional payment methods.
Additionally, the food labeling method is an excellent way to help customers identify food items quickly. However, the labels should be clear and concise to avoid confusion. The Oriental Star's current labeling system is a bit cluttered and can be improved with larger and clearer fonts.
Conclusion
The service quality of The Oriental Star can be improved significantly with staff training services, improved ordering systems, redesigning the layout, and better food collection strategies. The Oriental Star's order-and-pay-at-the-table and labeling techniques are useful but need some tweaking to be more user-friendly. Continuously working towards service quality is integral to maintaining a steady clientele and enhancing the reputation of The Oriental Star.
