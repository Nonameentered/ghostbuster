The Lyon Tablet and Tacitus’ version of Claudius’ speech represent two distinct historical accounts of the same event, yet they differ in their portrayal of Claudius’ character and the overall persuasive effect of the speech. The two accounts, written during different time periods, shed light on the inconsistencies in historical narratives and the problems that arise when seeking to establish the truth behind historical events. This essay will explore the differences between the two accounts, the impact of these differences on the portrayal of Claudius’ character, and the overall persuasive effect of the speech.
The Lyon Tablet, also known as Congius of Lyon, is a bronze tablet discovered in 1528 in Lyon, France. The tablet contains an inscription that is believed to be a record of the speech given by Claudius to the Roman Senate in 48 CE, in which he advocated for the admission of Gauls to the Senate. Tacitus, on the other hand, provides his version of the speech in his Annales, written in the early second century CE. Despite their shared topic, the two accounts differ in their portrayal of Claudius’ character and the persuasive effect of the speech.
One key difference between the two accounts is in the way Claudius’ character is presented. The Lyon Tablet portrays Claudius as a confident and persuasive orator who is able to sway the Senate to his cause. This is evident in the following passage: “he delivered a speech in which he extolled the Gauls to the skies and urged that they be admitted to the Senate. All those present were reported to have been astonished by his eloquence” (Lyon Tablet). In contrast, Tacitus portrays Claudius as a hesitant and fearful ruler who lacks the necessary skills to persuade the Senate. Tacitus describes Claudius as “in awe of his audience, stammering and stumbling through the speech that he had composed” (Tacitus). These contrasting portrayals of Claudius have significant implications for the overall persuasive effect of the speech.
The Lyon Tablet’s portrayal of Claudius as a confident and persuasive speaker has a persuasive effect on the audience. Claudius’ eloquence and ability to speak convincingly make it easier for the audience to support his cause. The tablet suggests that Claudius’ speech was so effective that it convinced the Senate to immediately vote in favor of the admission of Gauls to the Senate. This is evident in the tablet’s statement that “the Gauls having been admitted with an affirmative vote of the Senate” (Lyon Tablet). Thus, the persuasive effect of the speech is heightened by Claudius’ confident portrayal on the tablet.
In contrast, Tacitus’ portrayal of Claudius as a hesitant and fearful orator undermines the persuasive effect of the speech. Tacitus suggests that Claudius did not have the necessary skills to effectively persuade the Senate, which in turn makes it less likely that the audience would be swayed by his speech. This is evident in Tacitus’ statement that “the senators responded to the proposal with silence” (Tacitus). By highlighting the reception of the speech by the audience, Tacitus creates a very different persuasive effect than that which is conveyed in the Lyon Tablet.
Another key difference between the two accounts is in their historical accuracy. The Lyon Tablet, being a contemporary record, is generally considered to be a more reliable source of information. However, as with all historical narratives, it is subject to bias and interpretation, and cannot be considered entirely objective. Tacitus’ account, on the other hand, was written over a century after the events it describes, and is subject to the distortions of memory and personal biases. Moreover, Tacitus had a particular agenda in writing his history, and therefore may have presented the speech in a way that supported his own political views.
Despite these issues, Tacitus’ account provides important contextual information that is absent from the Lyon Tablet. In particular, Tacitus provides information about the political atmosphere of the time, and the challenges faced by Claudius in navigating the complex Roman political system. This is evident in Tacitus’ statement that “Claudius was trying to resolve an essentially political problem: how to maintain stability and legitimacy in a system that was inherently unstable” (Tacitus). By highlighting the political context in which the speech was given, Tacitus provides a more nuanced understanding of the events that took place and the challenges faced by Claudius.
In conclusion, the differences between the Lyon Tablet and Tacitus’ account of Claudius’ speech represent two distinct historical narratives of the same event that differ significantly in their portrayal of Claudius’ character and the overall persuasive effect of the speech. These differences highlight the challenges faced by historians in establishing a true and accurate picture of historical events, and the importance of context and interpretation in shaping our understanding of the past. Despite these challenges, both accounts provide important insights into the political and social context of the time, and the challenges faced by Roman rulers in navigating the complex political system. Ultimately, it is by analyzing and reconciling these different narratives that we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the past and the people who shaped it.
