The question regarding the relationship between mind and body has been a long-standing debate among philosophers. One of the most influential perspectives on this topic is the Cartesian dualism theory proposed by renowned French philosopher Ren√© Descartes. While Descartes' explanation for the connection between the mind and the body might seem valid at first glance, it is not without its critics. To assess the validity of Descartes' argument for the dualism between the mind and body, it is crucial to compare and contrast his position with the ideas presented by Hobbes, another prominent philosopher. This essay will examine both philosophers' positions and compare their theories about the relationship between the mind and the body.
Descartes' argument for dualism began with his assertion that matter is inherently extensional and made up of divisible, physical particles that have measurable properties such as weight and shape. In contrast, the mind is non-extensional, unobservable, and can only be described subjectively by the individual experiencing it. Descartes further argued that the two entities, mind, and body, have separate properties, which make them entirely different from each other. He believed that the physical world is governed by the laws of science, while the mind cannot be fully understood by science and can only be explored through introspection. This view became known as "mind-body dualism," and it asserts that mind and body are distinct and separable entities that interact with each other.
Descartes' argument for dualism implies that the mind and body are different entities that work independently of each other. He suggests that our thoughts, feelings, and emotions exist only in the realm of the mind and have no impact on the physical body. While this argument appears compelling, it raises questions about how the mind and body interact. If the mind is non-physical, how can it influence the body's physical actions? Descartes posited that the link between the two entities is mediated through the Pineal Gland, an unpaired gland located in the brain. He proposed that the Pineal Gland is responsible for transmitting the thoughts generated in the mind to the physical body's actions. Descartes' theory of the Pineal Gland's mediation has been criticized for being vague and lacking empirical evidence.
Thomas Hobbes, on the other hand, presents a differing view about the relationship between the mind and body. Hobbes agrees with Descartes that the body is physical and part of the physical world; however, he argues that the mind is not separate from the body. Hobbes believed that the mind is corporeal and that thinking is a physical function; he suggests that we process our thoughts through the brain's material activity. Hobbes hypothesized that the nervous system connects the body to the brain, where our thoughts are generated, and then transmitted to the body. This, he argues, allows for the body and the mind to interact causally and that the two are not fundamentally different entities.
Hobbes's claim against Descartes' theory is consistent with empirical evidence about the relationship between the mind and body. Modern medicine has shown that certain mental states result in physical changes. For example, it has been observed that psychological stress can result in physical symptoms like headaches, nausea, and muscle tension. Similarly, the use of recreational drugs can significantly affect one's mood and cognitive functions, and these can have substantial physical repercussions. Such observations imply that the mind and body are inextricably linked, and they both impact each other.
In conclusion, Descartes' argument for dualism presents an intriguing perspective about the relationship between the mind and body. Nevertheless, while his dualism viewpoint has some validity, there are questions about how the two entities interact. Hobbes' theory, which emphasizes that the mind is corporeal and that thinking is a physical process, is backed by empirical evidence that shows the interaction between the mind and body. The comparison shows that the dualism between the mind and body is less apparent than Descartes postulated and that the two entities are interconnected and influence each other. Therefore, it is crucial to continue exploring the complexities of the relationship between the mind and body to gain a deeper understanding of their interactions.
