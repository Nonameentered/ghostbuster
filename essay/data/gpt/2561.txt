Human remains are an invaluable source of information when it comes to understanding life and death in the past. Archaeologists can gain important insights into the physical, cultural, and social aspects of past societies by studying how people in those societies were buried. In this essay, I will explore what human remains can tell us about life and death in the past, using the Eastern cemetery of Roman London as a case study. I will discuss the inferences that archaeologists can draw from the disposal of human remains, and the caution that must be exercised when interpreting them.

The Eastern cemetery of Roman London is a particularly interesting case study because it provides a wealth of information about burial practices during the Roman period in Britain. The cemetery was used between the late 1st century and the early 5th century AD, and contains the remains of over 10,000 individuals. Archaeologists have been studying the cemetery since the 1980s, and their findings have shed light on many aspects of life and death in Roman London.

One of the most important things that archaeologists can learn from human remains is what people ate. This is because chemical compounds from food are deposited in bones and teeth, and can be detected through analysis. In the case of the Eastern cemetery, isotopic analysis of teeth has revealed that many of the people buried there were immigrants to London from other parts of the Roman Empire. This is important because it indicates that London was a cosmopolitan city, with people from many different parts of the Empire living and working there. The isotopic analysis has also shown that people buried in the cemetery who were born and raised in London probably had a diet rich in fish and other seafood, which was abundant in the nearby Thames River.

Another thing that human remains can tell us is how people lived and worked. For example, the presence of occupational injuries and diseases in the skeletons of the people buried in the Eastern cemetery indicates that many of them were engaged in hard physical labor. This is corroborated by historical evidence which shows that London was an important center for trade and commerce during the Roman period, with many people working as artisans, laborers, or merchants. Similarly, differences in the health and nutrition of different individuals can reveal information about social status and access to resources. For example, people who were buried with more elaborate grave goods may have been wealthier or held higher social status than those who were not.

Human remains can also reveal valuable information about death and burial practices. For example, the position and orientation of the body can indicate cultural beliefs about life after death. In the case of the Eastern cemetery, many of the burials were oriented east-west, which is consistent with Christian burial practices. This suggests that Christianity was becoming an important religious influence in London by the end of the Roman period. Additionally, the presence of grave goods such as jewelry, pottery, and other household items can provide insights into cultural beliefs about the afterlife, as well as socio-economic status and gender. For example, women were often buried with more jewelry, while men were buried with weapons or tools.

However, it is important to exercise caution when interpreting human remains. It is easy to make assumptions or draw conclusions that are not supported by the evidence. For example, just because someone was buried with elaborate grave goods does not necessarily mean they were wealthy or of high social status. It is possible that the grave goods were borrowed or inherited from someone else. Similarly, it is important to avoid assuming that all individuals buried in a particular cemetery were part of the same cultural or ethnic group. The evidence from the Eastern cemetery suggests that there was a great deal of diversity in Roman London, and it is likely that the people buried in the cemetery came from many different backgrounds and walks of life.

Another important consideration when interpreting human remains is the potential for bias. This is particularly true when it comes to gender, race, and other social categories. For example, in the past, archaeologists often assumed that any individual buried with weapons or tools was male, and any individual buried with jewelry or other decorative objects was female. However, it is now understood that these assumptions are often inaccurate, and that gender roles and identities were more fluid and complex in the past than we might have previously thought. It is important to avoid imposing modern assumptions or prejudices on the past, and instead approach the evidence with an open mind and a willingness to revise our interpretations based on new information.

In conclusion, human remains are a valuable source of information when it comes to understanding life and death in the past. Using the Eastern cemetery of Roman London as a case study, we can see how archaeologists can draw inferences about diet, health, occupation, and cultural practices from the disposal of human remains. However, it is important to exercise caution when interpreting these remains, and to avoid making assumptions or drawing conclusions that are not supported by the evidence. By approaching the evidence with an open mind and taking into account potential bias and other limitations, we can gain a more nuanced and accurate understanding of the past.
