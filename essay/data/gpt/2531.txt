System identification is the process of building mathematical models that describe the behavior of a physical system based on the input and output signals generated by the system. This process can be useful in many applications, including adaptive control, estimation, and signal processing. Recursive identification is a type of system identification technique that can be used to continuously update the model based on new data, making it well-suited for applications where the system dynamics may change over time.
The recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm is a popular approach to recursive identification that is often used in mechanical systems such as robots. In this algorithm, the model parameters are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared error between the measured output and the predicted output of the model. The algorithm then updates the model parameters using a weighted least squares approach, where the weights are determined by the covariance matrix of the measurement noise.
To illustrate the use of the RLS algorithm in mechanical systems, let's consider a telemanipulation system that consists of a "master" robot and a "slave" robot. The master robot is used to control the slave robot, where the master robot is operated by a human operator and the slave robot performs the desired task. The goal of the RLS algorithm is to build a mathematical model of the master robot that can be used to control the slave robot.
To use the RLS algorithm for parameter estimation and modeling of the master robot, we first need to collect input and output data from the system. In this case, we would collect data on the position and velocity of the master robot, as well as the forces and torques applied to the robot by the operator. This data could be collected using sensors on the robot or through motion capture systems.
Once we have collected the data, we can use the RLS algorithm to estimate the model parameters. We would start by initializing the model parameters and covariance matrix using prior knowledge or initial measurements. Then we would process the incoming data using the RLS algorithm to update the model parameters with each new data point. The algorithm would weight each data point based on the covariance of the measurement noise, giving more weight to more accurate measurements.
The addition of Instrument Variables or a PLS noise model can affect the results of the RLS algorithm by accounting for external factors that may be affecting the system dynamics. Instrument Variables are additional input signals that are not directly related to the system but can account for external disturbances. A Partial Least Squares (PLS) noise model is an approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the measurement noise. By accounting for these external factors, the RLS algorithm can produce more accurate models of the system.
In summary, the RLS algorithm is a powerful technique for building models of dynamic systems that can be updated as new data becomes available. In the context of mechanical systems such as robots, this technique can be valuable for adaptive control, estimation, and signal processing. By continuously updating the model based on new data, the RLS algorithm can account for changes in the system dynamics over time and produce more accurate models. The inclusion of Instrument Variables or a PLS noise model can further improve the accuracy of the model by accounting for external factors that may be affecting the system. Overall, the RLS algorithm can be an effective tool for modeling dynamic systems and controlling them.
