The cultural web offers a comprehensive model that helps to analyze organizational culture and facilitate change. This model brings out the interconnectedness of different elements that make up the fabric of a company's culture, and how these elements reinforce each other. The cultural web includes six components which are symbols, rituals and routines, stories, control systems, power structures, and organizational structures.
Symbols are objects, actions, or images that communicate a particular meaning within an organization's culture. The role of these symbols is to create a shared understanding of important aspects of the organization. In Marks and Spencer, symbols include their green and white branding, the iconic St. Michael label, and the bag-for-life initiative. These symbols reinforce the company's identity and values.
Rituals and routines are specific patterns of behavior that members of an organization follow repeatedly. Rituals and routines refer to organizational practices that have developed over time, been replicated, and become part of the organizational culture. In the case of Marks and Spencer, rituals and routines include the company's "plan a" sustainability initiative and the annual gingerbread biscuits that have become part of their Christmas tradition.
Organizational stories refer to the anecdotes and myths that organizations use to reinforce the central tenets of their culture. These stories communicate and preserve key aspects of organizational culture and identity. In Marks and Spencer, the story of how the company's founder, Michael Marks, sold goods from a market stall is one of the company's central stories that reinforces Marks and Spencer's core values.
Control systems refer to the mechanisms that organizations use to manage their operations. Control systems are designed to ensure that the organization's activities are consistent with its goals. In Marks and Spencer, the company's control systems include their longstanding practices of extensive supplier auditing and quality control.
Power structures refer to the system of accountability and authority that is specific to an organization. They represent the distribution of power across different departments and individuals. In Marks and Spencer, the company's power structures are characterized by a highly centralized system of authority, with individual departments and managers reporting to the company CEO.
Organizational structures refer to the formal and informal relationships between individuals within an organization. The structure of an organization is characterized by patterns of communication, relationship building, and power distribution. In Marks and Spencer, the company's organizational structure is hierarchical, with customers at the top followed by different departments and managers that report to the CEO.
Leveraging these different cultural web components, organizations can facilitate change by focusing on specific levers. These levers include strategies such as redesigning control systems, modifying organizational structures, changing established power structures, introducing new symbols, or reshaping organizational stories. Marks and Spencer, a leading British retailer, provides an excellent case study of how different CEOs have used these levers to turn the struggling company around.
In the early 2000s, Marks and Spencer was a struggling company, with declining sales and an unclear identity. In response to these challenges, the company hired a new CEO, Stuart Rose, in 2004. Upon his appointment, Stuart Rose initiated a new cultural strategy. One of the primary levers he used to manage this change was redesigned control systems, which involved extensive supplier auditing.
Under his leadership, a new Quality Assessment scorecard was introduced to ensure that not only were suppliers adhering to Marks and Spencer's sustainability policies, but they were also meeting ethical and environmental standards. Through this strategy, Marks and Spencer reformed its supply chain management, which in turn provided positive publicity for the company. The change in cultural strategy resulted in a remarkable turnaround for Marks and Spencer, with profits increasing by more than 50%.
Later in 2010, another CEO was appointed to manage the company. Marc Bolland, who had a wealth of experience in the retail industry, took over the helm of the company and immediately initiated a new cultural strategy. Bolland employed different levers to manage the strategic change, including modifying organizational structures and reshaping organizational stories.
To modify the organizational structure, Bolland introduced a new food division, which was different from the traditional apparel and household goods. This move differentiated Marks and Spencer from its competitors, and helped to diversify the company's revenue streams. As for the reshaping of organizational stories, Bolland introduced a new brand tagline, "Only at M&S, We make every day special." This slogan became central to the company's storytelling, and communicated the company's new focus on innovation and connections to customers.
In conclusion, in today's dynamic business environment, organizational culture is critical to the success of any company. To achieve a cultural shift, organizations need to understand their existing culture and use appropriate levers to manage strategic change. The cultural web is an effective tool that organizations can use to analyze and change their culture. Using Marks and Spencer as an example, it is evident that understanding the elements of the cultural web can significantly help in driving change, especially when leveraged appropriately. CEOs must focus on understanding their organizational culture, and use the elements of the cultural web to assess and intervene to drive the desired outcomes.
