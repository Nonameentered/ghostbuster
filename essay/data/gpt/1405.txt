Since the emergence of the “New Archaeology” movement in the 1960s, the field of archaeology has undergone several paradigm shifts. One of the most significant contributions to the field of archaeology is the post-processual approach developed by Barbara Bender. Another important approach that came to the forefront during the mid-1980s is the critical theory approach of Alison Wylie. Despite several differences between these approaches, both have played a vital role in shaping the current practice of archaeology. This essay aims to compare and contrast both approaches using specific examples from their work.
The post-processual approach to archaeology developed by Barbara Bender is a theoretical perspective that challenges the scientific assumptions of the “New Archaeology” movement. The post-processual approach evolved from an earlier position that focused solely on the excavation of material culture. Bender sought to bring ethnographic and other social science methods and theories to archaeological research. The post-processual approach recognized the need for understanding the broader social, political, and economic contexts that influenced the people who created the material culture. For example, Bender's work in the Aegean focused on the symbolic meanings of different objects and the context in which they were used. This work aimed to explore the social and spiritual significance of the objects and to understand how material culture contributed to the construction and expression of social roles and identities.
In contrast, the critical theory approach of Alison Wylie is rooted in philosophy and cultural studies. Wylie’s critical theory seeks to uncover the underlying power structures and social inequalities that are embedded within the production of archaeological knowledge. Wylie argues that archaeological research is not neutral but is shaped by the ideologies and cultural assumptions of the researchers. Wylie believes that the archaeological record is an artifact of historical processes that is heavily influenced by the social, economic, and political contexts, where the process of creating knowledge can reinforce systems of power. For example, Wylie’s research has shown how patriarchal assumptions have influenced the interpretation of prehistoric societies in North America. Wylie critiques that the traditional gender identity of prehistoric societies is interpreted based on the gender norms of Western societies, often resulting in the silencing of the voices of women and other marginalized communities.
Both Bender’s post-processual approach and Wylie’s critical theory approach share several commonalities in their theoretical perspectives, despite their differences. One of their common goals is the recognition of the importance of human agency in archaeological research. Bender’s post-processual approach emphasizes the role of individuals in the creation and interpretation of material culture. This approach recognizes the influence of social and cultural factors in the construction of a collective identity. Similarly, Wylie’s critical theory approach does not view the past as a static entity that reflects only technological advancement or evolutionary progress. Instead, Wylie’s approach emphasizes that humans actively create the social and physical world around them.
Another commonality between these two approaches is their critical analysis of the role of archaeology in the production of knowledge. Both Bender and Wylie recognize that archaeological research is not objective but is shaped by social, economic, and political contexts. However, Bender’s post-processual approach focuses on the ideological influences in constructing meaning in the archaeological record, while Wylie’s critical theory approach is concerned with the structural inequalities that underpin the production of knowledge. They both call for greater reflexivity on the part of archaeologists to acknowledge their role in the construction and interpretation of the archaeological record.
In conclusion, as we have seen in the preceding discussion, the post-processual approach of Barbara Bender and the critical theory approach of Alison Wylie offer different theoretical perspectives in the field of archaeology. Bender’s post-processual approach emphasizes the constructive role of individuals and communities in the creation and interpretation of material culture. Wylie’s critical theory approach critiques the biased and systemic patterns in the construction of archaeological knowledge. However, both approaches share a common goal of recognizing the importance of the human agent in archaeological research and encouraging archaeologists to be more reflexive in their work. It is important to recognize the relevance of both approaches to a better understanding of the past and the present.
