Globalisation has been one of the most significant phenomena of the past few decades, transforming the world in ways that were previously unimaginable. The increasing mobility of capital and the emergence of transnational production chains are two key characteristics of globalisation that have gained much attention in recent years. Liberal International Political Economy (IPE) and free trade have been widely used to explain globalisation. This essay assesses the explanatory utility of liberal IPE and free trade in explaining globalisation and evaluates the relevance of classic liberalism and interdependence theory to understanding contemporary globalisation. The essay also considers the challenges that globalisation poses to liberal assumptions.
Liberal IPE and free trade are based on the assumption that the free flow of goods, capital, and labour across borders leads to economic growth and prosperity. Proponents of these theories argue that open markets and free trade agreements stimulate competition, innovation, and investment. In turn, the benefits of this economic growth- jobs, higher wages, and access to cheaper goods- are spread to all members of society. According to this perspective, economic globalisation then is simply a product of the free market and its ability to generate wealth. Hence, it is seen as a force for good that can lift countries out of poverty and promote development.
However, a growing body of critical literature challenges the assumptions of liberal IPE and free trade, arguing that it woefully oversimplifies the economic dynamics of globalisation. Critics point out that the benefits of globalisation have not been evenly distributed. As more and more companies seek to outsource production, they move to countries where labour is cheaper, often at the expense of domestic employment. This triggers a race-to-the-bottom in which countries are pressured to reduce wages, relax regulations and lower environmental standards to remain competitive in the global marketplace.
Moreover, globalisation has led to the rise of transnational corporations (TNCs) that have significant economic power and influence. They are able to leverage their position to demand favourable treatment from governments. As they can easily move production and capital overseas, governments attempting to regulate them face significant challenges. Critics argue that the uneven distribution of wealth, power, and influence between TNCs and domestic actors undermines democracy and social justice, and thus the benefits of economic growth.
The emergence of transnational production chains in globalisation is another key characteristic that poses challenges to the explanatory utility of liberal IPE and free trade. The global production process constitutes multiple layers of value chains that stretch across national and regional borders. These value chains are arranged in a network that connects the sourcing of raw materials to the final assembly of finished goods. Globalisation has led to the integration of these value chains, with goods being produced by several actors, often in different countries or regions. These complex structures enable firms to exploit low labour costs and low regulatory standards in different locations.
However, critics point out that these complex production chains have led to a race-to-the-bottom. As competition for global markets increases, multinational companies are forced to cut costs, often at the expense of workers' rights and environmental standards in developing countries. Thus, transnational production chains have resulted in “perverse” effects. They weaken the ability of developing countries to compete in the global marketplace, and create a vicious cycle of low wages, low productivity, and low standards.
The relevance of classic liberalism to understanding contemporary globalisation has also been questioned. Liberalism’s main tenets are free markets, private property, and individual rights. It asserts that individuals pursuing their self-interest will promote the general welfare. However, the development of globalisation has led to an expansion of state power. States have assumed significant roles to regulate and coordinate economic activity, as well as to provide welfare to those who have been left behind the globalisation process. Hence, the idea of minimal government intervention in markets- a cornerstone of liberalism- does not fit well with the reality of globalisation.
Furthermore, the interdependence theory has been used to explain the role of states in shaping the global political economy and to what extent they remain autonomous actors in the face of globalisation. Interdependence theory posits that the actors in international political economy are interdependent. The interdependence leads to the transformation of the international state system as each country's international environment affects its behaviour. Interdependence provides both opportunities and problems in the international arena. For opportunities, states recognize the opportunities presented by particular changes in the international environment, and those who take advantage of these opportunities will benefit. For problems, states may also recognize that some changes in the international environment constrain or threaten their interests.
The challenges that globalisation poses to liberal assumptions are significant. Many scholars argue that the forces of globalisation have instead resulted in rising economic and political inequality around the world. The rise of ethnic nationalism and populism in both developed and developing countries is also evidence of the tensions and challenges to liberalism posed by globalisation. Critics argue that the benefits of globalisation have been unevenly distributed and that the free flow of goods, capital and labour has led to a concentration of wealth, power, and influence in the hands of a few.
In conclusion, liberal IPE and free trade provide limited explanatory utility in understanding the complexities of globalisation, particularly the increasing mobility of capital and the emergence of transnational production chains. Critics challenge the hypothesis that the free market and open markets can stimulate development and spread the benefits of economic growth to all members of society. Furthermore, classic liberalism and interdependence theory’s relevance to contemporary globalisation are limited. The rise of nationalism and populism, along with the challenges posed by transnational production chains, have significant implications for global neoliberalism. The current COVID-19 pandemic has further demonstrated the fragility of the global economy, the unequal distribution of power and wealth, and the challenges of international cooperation during a crisis. Therefore, there is a pressing need for new theories and approaches that can better account for the complexities and contradictions of contemporary globalisation and provide an alternative vision for the global political economy.
