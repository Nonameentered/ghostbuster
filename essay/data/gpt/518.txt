Judicial review is the process where the court investigates legal decisions made by public authorities and ensures that they were made within the confines of the law. Students who have been disciplined or expelled from school have the right to challenge that decision through judicial review by the courts. In this essay, we will explore the grounds for judicial review that are available to students who have been disciplined or expelled from school. We will also explore how students might use the grounds of non-citation of relevant considerations, the right to a hearing, or the rule against bias to argue their case in court. Finally, we will examine the principles of proportionality and Wednesbury unreasonableness and how they can be used to challenge a school's disciplinary policy.
Possible Grounds for Judicial Review
Students who have been disciplined or expelled from school can apply for a judicial review if they believe that there has been a procedural error. There are several grounds that a student can use to challenge a decision made by the school. These include:
Non-Citation of Relevant Considerations
If the school fails to take into account relevant considerations when making a decision, this can be a ground for judicial review. In a case where a student was disciplined for allegedly bullying another student, the school must take into account all relevant factors before making a decision. If the school failed to take into consideration any relevant factors, a student could use this as a ground for judicial review.
The Right to a Hearing
Students have the right to be heard before a decision is made. If the school does not provide a student with the opportunity to defend themselves, this can be a ground for judicial review. In a case where a student was expelled from school without being given a fair hearing, they could use this as a ground for judicial review.
The Rule Against Bias
The rule against bias states that a decision-maker must be unbiased and impartial. If there is evidence to suggest that the decision-maker was biased, this can be a ground for judicial review. In a case where a teacher who has a personal issue with a student was responsible for disciplining that student, the student could use this as a ground for judicial review.
Principles of Proportionality
The principle of proportionality means that the punishment must be proportionate to the offence. If the punishment is too severe, this can be a ground for judicial review. In a case where a student was expelled from school for being late to class, the punishment might be considered disproportionate, and the student could use this as a ground for judicial review.
Wednesbury Unreasonableness
The principle of Wednesbury unreasonableness refers to a decision that is so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have come to the same conclusion. If the decision is so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have made it, this can be a ground for judicial review. In a case where a student was expelled from school for a minor offence, such as forgetting a pen, the decision might be considered so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have come to the same conclusion, and the student could use this as a ground for judicial review.
Using the Grounds of Non-Citation of Relevant Considerations, the Right to a Hearing, or the Rule Against Bias to Argue a Case in Court
If a student wishes to challenge a disciplinary decision made by the school, they can use the grounds of non-citation of relevant considerations, the right to a hearing, or the rule against bias to argue their case in court. For example, if a student was expelled from school without being given a fair hearing, they could argue that they were denied their right to a hearing. The student would need to show that the decision was made without allowing them the opportunity to defend themselves.
Similarly, if a student believes that the decision-maker was biased, they could use this as a ground for judicial review. The student would need to provide evidence to show that the decision-maker was biased. This might include evidence of previous conflicts between the student and the decision-maker.
Using the Principles of Proportionality or Wednesbury Unreasonableness to Challenge a School's Disciplinary Policy
The principles of proportionality and Wednesbury unreasonableness can be used to challenge a school's disciplinary policy. For example, if a school has a policy that expels students for minor offences, a student could argue that the policy is disproportionate. They might argue that a policy that expels students for minor offences is unreasonable and that a more reasonable approach would be to give them a warning or a lesser punishment.
Similarly, if a student believes that a decision made by the school is unreasonable, they might argue that it breaches the principle of Wednesbury unreasonableness. This might include arguing that the punishment is so severe that it is unreasonable and would not be made by a reasonable person.
Conclusion
In conclusion, students who have been disciplined or expelled from school have the right to apply for judicial review. There are several grounds that a student can use to challenge a decision made by the school. These include non-citation of relevant considerations, the right to a hearing, and the rule against bias. The principles of proportionality and Wednesbury unreasonableness can also be used to challenge a school's disciplinary policy. Students who believe that they have been treated unfairly by the school should seek legal advice and consider applying for a judicial review.
