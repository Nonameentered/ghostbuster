William Shakespeare’s play Othello is a masterpiece of literature, which explores the complexities of human nature and societal structures. It is a play whose themes are still relevant in modern society. The play’s protagonist, Othello, is a complex and multilayered character whose monologue in Act Five, Scene Two is a critical moment that unveils the inner character of the protagonist and the cultural meanings it carries. A structuralist reading of the monologue reveals elements of Othello’s identity construction, his relationship with power and the cultural codes of masculinity and racial identity, which indicate the complexities and contradictions of the protagonist's character.
Structuralism is a theoretical approach to literature that considers the text as a system of signs and relations that produce meaning. Structuralism emphasizes the importance of codes, conventions, and underlying structures in literature, and aims to uncover the cultural meanings embedded in the text. In the monologue in Act Five, Scene Two of Othello, structuralism can be used to reveal the cultural codes of power, race, and gender that Shakespeare employs to construct the identity of his protagonist.
Othello’s monologue in Act Five, Scene Two is a moment of immense psychological turmoil for the protagonist, as he confronts the consequences of his actions and the betrayal of his trust by his wife, Desdemona. In the monologue, Othello reflects on the nature of his identity and his standing in society, as he struggles to reconcile his actions with his self-image as a noble and virtuous man.
A structuralist reading of the monologue reveals that Othello's identity is constantly constructed and reconstructed by his interactions with societal structures and the power relations within them. The monologue is structured around Othello's reflection on his identity, as he associates his social standing with his racial identity. He states, “I have done the state some service, and they know’t. / No more of that. I pray you in your letters, / When you shall these unlucky deeds relate, / Speak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate, / Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak / Of one that loved not wisely, but too well” (5.2. 341-346). Here, Othello is reflecting on his social standing as a noble and honorable man. He believes that his service to the state and his military prowess should be enough to secure his status, but he also acknowledges that his actions have betrayed this image of himself. The phrase “but too well” connotes his misplaced love for Desdemona. It is pertinent to note that Othello's actions are not inherent to his identity but are situational to the power relations in the play.
Moreover, the monologue highlights the power dynamics and gender relations prevalent in Othello's society. Othello's monologue reflects his preoccupation with the cultural codes of masculinity and honor, which are the driving forces behind his actions. Othello is trying to reconcile his love for Desdemona with his self-image as a man of honor. The phrase “Speak of me as I am” (5.2.343) highlights the significance of reputation and social image in his society. The statement denotes his desire to have his image portrayed accurately and gloriously. For Othello, honor and reputation are both crucial elements of his self-image, which are deeply intertwined with the cultural codes of masculinity and duty.
Similarly, implicit in Othello's monologue is the cultural coding of masculinist honor and valor. In his monologue, Othello is striving to protect his honor and maintain his status as a man: “I would not kill thy unprepared spirit. / No;—heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul” (5.2.30-31). The statement highlights that killing a woman is just below the ethical cut-off for acceptable masculine behavior in his cultural coding. The impropriety in killing a woman denotes that it is a shameful act. However, the honor code begins to unwind soon after as he kills his wife. Hence, the monologue reveals the inherent contradiction within the masculinist honor culture of 16th century England.
Additionally, the monologue underscores the link between Othello's identity and his racial identity. Othello is acutely aware of his status as a black man in a white society, and he uses this to explain his actions. He states, “Haply, for I am black / And have not those soft parts of conversation / That clamberers have, or for I am declined / Into the vale of years” (5.2.267-270). Here, Othello is implying that his social standing is compromised because of his race and age. He believes that he does not possess the same social skills as the "clamberers," denoting the white society that dominates the play. The phrase “haply for I am black” hints at the intersection of race and power that is inherent to Othello’s identity construction. The color of his skin is a significant factor in his identity formation, as his race and whiteness are cultural code markers that symbolize a series of structural power relations.
Structuralism reading of Othello’s monologue, thus reveals that the protagonist's identity is deeply intertwined with cultural codes of race, gender and power. These codes structure Othello's identity and position within the societal structures, but each has inherent contradictions. Race compounded with the masculinist honor culture, creates a paradox in Othello's self-identity. In this sense, Othello's monologue underscores the complexity and contradiction of the human psyche and the cultural coding of identity formation.
In conclusion, Othello's monologue in Act Five, Scene Two is a critical moment in the play that reveals the inner character of the protagonist and the cultural meanings it carries. A structuralist reading of the monologue reveals the complexities and contradictions of Othello's identity, which is constructed by the cultural codes of power, race, and gender prevalent in society. Thus, Othello’s monologue underscores the importance of cultural codes in shaping an individual's identity, position in society, and relationships with power. It is a profound masterpiece that highlights the complexities of the human psyche, which are still relevant in contemporary times.
