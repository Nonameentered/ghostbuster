Propaganda is a tool that is used to influence and control public opinion in favor of certain political or ideological beliefs. It has been used throughout history to legitimize actions taken by governments or rulers, to demonize opponents, and to justify wars or oppressive policies. The role of propaganda in the Occitan fragments of Bechada's account of the crusade at Antioch is crucial in understanding the motivations, justifications, and ideologies of the Crusaders.
The Occitan fragments of Bechada's account of the crusade at Antioch were written in Occitan, which was the language of the troubadours, a cultural and linguistic group of southern France. The fragments were written in poetic prose and were designed to be performed in front of audiences. These fragments portray the Crusaders as heroic, brave, and justified in their actions against the Muslim forces at Antioch. They frame the Crusaders as defenders of Christianity, fighting against the infidel, and reclaiming holy sites from Muslim control.
At the heart of the Occitan fragments lies a propaganda campaign that served to justify the Crusaders' action in the eyes of the Occitan people. The fragments were written to inspire the Occitan people to join the Crusades and to provide a narrative that would legitimize their involvement. The Occitan people had a history of tension and conflict with the neighboring Muslim states, and the Crusades offered an opportunity to fulfill their religious obligations and to reclaim lost territories.
The Crusaders used targeted propaganda in the form of the Occitan fragments to justify their actions to the people back home. The fragments painted a heroic picture of the Crusaders, emphasizing their bravery and commitment to the Christian faith.

The propaganda campaign sought to dehumanize the Muslims and to portray them as barbaric and ruthless. The fragments described the behavior of the Muslims in the most negative terms, emphasizing their cruelty, savagery, and immorality. The Crusaders used this propaganda to legitimize their actions against the Muslim forces, portraying their actions as necessary to defend their faith and their territories.

The propaganda served to instill a sense of purpose and commitment among the Crusaders, which was essential for maintaining morale during the conflict.
