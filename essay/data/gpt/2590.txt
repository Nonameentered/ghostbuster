The willingness to oppose tyrants is not a rare human trait; throughout history, we see individuals willingly fighting against oppressive rulers in the pursuit of liberty and justice. The Roman Empire was no exception, and it saw many men and women fighting against its tyrannical emperors, such as Nero and the Flavian emperors, even to the point of sacrificing their lives. But why did these individuals stand up against these rulers, knowing full well the risks they faced? In this essay, we shall explore the philosophical and traditional reasons behind this opposition, as well as how these emperors facilitated the resistance to their rule.
Philosophical reasons for opposing tyrants were many, but they were largely grounded in the idea of justice, which was a crucial aspect of Roman thought. The philosopher Seneca, for instance, believed that people should be free to pursue their own interests without fear of oppression or coercion. Moreover, he believed that the tyrant's aim was to turn free men into slaves, and that such an endeavour was against Roman values. In his "On the Tranquillity of Mind," Seneca said, "Tyranntes providence est libertatem sub specie pacis opprimere" (The aim of tyrants is to deprive men of their freedom under the guise of peace). In other words, tyrants would use the guise of "order" to oppress the people, depriving them of their freedom. Thus, opposition to tyrants was seen as a way of upholding the idea of justice, which included the freedom and equality of citizens.
Another important philosophical reason for opposing tyrants was the belief that they were a threat to the stability of the state. Roman political thought was built on the idea of the "common good," which meant that the state should seek the best interests of all its citizens. Accordingly, any ruler whose policies endangered this ideal was considered a danger to the state, and thus, to be opposed. The philosopher Cicero believed that the state should be ruled by "the best and wisest men ... for the benefit of all the citizens." In his "On Duties," Cicero argued that "tyranny is nothing short of a monstrous disease in the body politic." He believed that such a system could only lead to the breakdown of order and stability. For Opponents of Nero and the Flavian emperors, therefore, the desire for political stability reinforced their opposition to these rulers.
Apart from philosophical reasons, traditional Roman values and practices also played a role in the opposition against the emperors. Roman society was highly hierarchical, with strict social roles and customs that regulated various aspects of daily life. This hierarchical societal structure, which allowed some degree of social mobility, had produced a culture that valued independence, self-reliance, and respect for authority. Thus, any ruler who threatened to disrupt this societal structure was seen as a threat to the fundamental values of Roman society.
Moreover, loyalty to Rome and the military played a significant role in the opposition to Nero and the Flavian emperors. Roman military officers had a strong sense of duty to their soldiers and the Empire, which meant that they were often willing to go to great lengths to protect their men and the state's stability. For these men, serving under a tyrannical ruler would be a betrayal of this sense of loyalty and duty. Furthermore, Rome's military tradition was built on the idea of the "strong man," a skilled warrior who could lead his men in battle and inspire them to victory. This tradition placed great importance on strength, prowess, and bravery, values that were diametrically opposed to the idea of a cowardly, tyrannical ruler. Thus, for many military officers, opposing tyrants like Nero and the Flavian emperors was a way of upholding Roman military tradition and the values it represented.
As mentioned earlier, the Flavian emperors facilitated the opposition against their rule; this was because they were often seen as illegitimate rulers who had usurped the throne through force. For the most part, Roman emperors legitimized their rule through the support of existing Roman institutions, such as the Senate, the army, and leading political figures. However, the Flavian emperors came to power through a civil war, which meant that they had little support from the previous regime. As a result, they had to establish their legitimacy through military might and coercion, leading to the widespread perception that they were illegitimate rulers who had seized power illegally. This perception aroused much resentment and opposition from various quarters, including the aristocracy, the military, and the general public.
The Flavian emperors also facilitated opposition to their rule by introducing policies that were often unpopular with the general populace. For instance, Vespasian, the first Flavian emperor, was seen as a harsh ruler, known for his strict disciplinary policies in the army and his refusal to pardon political prisoners. The people of Rome did not like him, and this made it easier for opposition movements to garner support against him.
Another way in which the Flavian emperors facilitated resistance to their rule was through their military policies. By aggressively expanding the Roman Empire, they placed great demands on the military, leading to frequent recruitment campaigns and long deployments that often kept soldiers away from their families for long periods. This overextension of Rome's military might put considerable strain on the empire's resources, leading to widespread discontent and opposition among the military.
Finally, it is worth noting that the Flavian emperors faced opposition from many different groups, including senators, freedmen, poets, and the military. The poet Juvenal, for instance, wrote satirical poems that criticized the emperors for their greed and extravagance. Other writers, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, also wrote scathing histories of the Flavian period. The Flavian emperors also faced several military uprisings during their reigns, including the "Year of the Four Emperors," a civil war that led to the establishment of the Flavian dynasty. All of these factors combined to create an environment of opposition and resistance that the Flavian emperors found difficult to contain.
In conclusion, the opposition to emperors like Nero and the Flavians was driven by a combination of philosophical and traditional values, along with the perception that these rulers were illegitimate and oppressive. Philosophers like Seneca and Cicero believed that tyrants threatened justice and the stability of the state, while traditional Roman values of independence, self-reliance, and loyalty also drove much of the opposition. The Flavian emperors facilitated this opposition by coming to power through military force and introducing unpopular policies that sparked discontent and resentment among the populace. All in all, the willingness of men and women to stand up against tyrants like Nero and the Flavians was a testament to the enduring power of the human spirit to resist oppression and uphold the values of freedom, equality, and justice.
