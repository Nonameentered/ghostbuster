Propaganda has undoubtedly been a critical tool used in society to shape public opinion. The impact of films in shaping people's beliefs and perception of society is undeniable. Propaganda films fall under two categories: persuasive and agitative. Persuasive propaganda films are created with the purpose of gradually influencing people's attitudes, while agitative propaganda uses forceful tactics to manipulate people's opinions. Effective propaganda films should create a positive emotional response in the viewers, generate a sense of belonging, and promote messages that are ideologically consistent with the intended audience. 
In this essay, we will analyze some films that qualify as propaganda. The films that we will be analyzing include, but are not limited to, "The Birth of a Nation," directed by D.W. Griffith, "Triumph of the Will," directed by Leni Riefenstahl, and "The Battle of Algiers," directed by Gillo Pontecorvo. We will explore how these films serve as effective vehicles of propaganda and what makes them successful in shaping public opinion. 
To begin with, "The Birth of a Nation," directed by D.W. Griffith, is a historical epic that glorifies the Ku Klux Klan and demonizes African Americans. It was the first Hollywood blockbuster that used advanced cinematic techniques such as cross-cutting, close-ups, and parallel editing. The film was a huge success, earning more than $10 million in revenue, an enormous sum in its time. 
"The Birth of a Nation" is persuasive propaganda, which aims to gradually change the viewers' attitudes towards African Americans. It portrays African Americans as savage animals who pose a threat to white women and families. The film is divided into two parts, detailing the lives of two families: The Stonemans, who are pro-union and abolitionist, and the Camerons, who are pro-Confederacy and white supremacist. The Stonemans include a character named Phil Stoneman who must distance himself from his black servant, who he had previously befriended, after his family turns against him. 
Historians acknowledge that the film played a significant role in the Ku Klux Klan's resurgence, which led to a sharp increase in lynchings and other forms of violence against African Americans. However, despite its appalling content, the film's innovative techniques, and compelling narrative style make it an effective propaganda tool. It arouses strong emotional reactions among the viewers and thus seals their allegiance to the message that African Americans are inferior. 
Similarly, the Nazi propaganda film "Triumph of the Will" is another example of effective propaganda. Directed by Leni Riefenstahl, the film chronicles the proceedings of the 1934 Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg. It features speeches by Hitler and other high-ranking Nazi officials, as well as grand military parades and other demonstrations of German national strength.
The film is agitative propaganda and aims to incite strong emotions in the viewers, mostly patriotism and national pride. The film's use of cinematic techniques such as aerial shots and close-ups make the demonstrations appear larger than life, and the music adds to the viewer's emotional reaction to the pageantry on display. The film was released during Hitler's chancellorship, a time when the Germans were disillusioned by economic hardships. The film aimed to give Germans a renewed sense of national pride.
"Triumph of the Will" is an effective propaganda tool, as it reinforces the Nazi ideology of Aryan supremacy and German imperialism. The film glorifies Hitler as a messiah who can save Germany from its woes and presents the Nazis' rallies as a glorification of Germany's power. 
Lastly, "The Battle of Algiers" directed by Gillo Pontecorvo, is a film that exposes the horrors of colonization and portrays the Algerian struggle for independence from France. The film presents the French colonial forces as brutal and insensitive to the Algerians' plight. The film's plot is based on real events and can be seen as persuasive propaganda. It aims to change the viewer's attitudes and encourage them to support the Algerian cause and condemns colonialism. 
"The Battle of Algiers" does not have a single hero, but an ensemble of characters who represent the Algerian fight for independence. The film is in French and Arabic, with English subtitles, an attempt to appeal to international audiences. The film's success can be attributed to its realistic portrayal of the conflict. The actors in the film were non-professionals who were real-life participants or survivors of the conflict, hence offering a realistic perspective of the war. Pontecorvo used a documentary style of filmmaking, with an emphasis on realistic settings and locations, to drive home his message. 
The film is effective propaganda because it highlights the injustices of colonialism while portraying the struggle for independence as a moral one, deserving of the world's support. The film is ideologically consistent with its target audience, especially anti-colonialists and supporters of independence movements worldwide. 
In conclusion, propaganda has been a powerful tool in shaping public opinion. The analyzed films above are influential propaganda tools because they successfully achieved their specific ideological messages in their intended audience. Effective propaganda films have a clear ideological message and a target audience. They instill positive emotional reactions in the viewer and a sense of belonging, creating a sense of solidarity between the audience and the message conveyed. The films analyzed in this essay, "The Birth of a Nation," "Triumph of the Will," and "The Battle of Algiers," serve as effective propaganda vehicles because they meet these criteria.
