The Cambridge Engineering Selector software is a tool that enables engineers to select materials and processes for various engineering projects. The software provides a comprehensive database of materials and their properties, as well as a range of processes that can be used for different applications.
For example, in the aerospace industry, the selection of materials is critical due to the harsh operating conditions that aircraft must endure. In this industry, the Cambridge Engineering Selector software can be used to select lightweight materials such as carbon-fiber reinforced polymers (CFRPs) that offer high strength-to-weight ratios. Additionally, the software can assist in the selection of processes for the manufacture of these materials, such as compression molding or autoclaving.
In the automotive industry, the selection of materials and processes focuses on durability and cost-effectiveness. The Cambridge Engineering Selector software can be used to select materials such as high-strength steel or aluminum alloys that offer good fatigue resistance. Processes such as stamping, hydroforming, and casting can be selected based on factors such as cost and production volume.
In summary, the Cambridge Engineering Selector software is a powerful tool for engineers involved in material and process selection. Its extensive database of materials and processes allows for informed decision-making based on factors such as cost, performance, and application requirements.
