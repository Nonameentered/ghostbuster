The patterning of the vertebrate limb can be understood through the three primary axes involved in its development: the proximal-distal axis, the anterior-posterior axis, and the dorsal-ventral axis. These three axes interact with each other to produce complete and correct morphology. In this essay, we will explore the role of signalling centres such as the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) and zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) in limb induction and patterning, and discuss the interplay between fibroblast growth factor (Fgf) and Wingless (Wnt) signalling pathways. Lastly, we will consider the current understanding and potential future directions in limb patterning research.
The proximal-distal axis is responsible for the elongation of the limb and the formation of segmented structures such as the humerus, ulna, and radius in the forelimb, and the femur, tibia, and fibula in the hindlimb. A critical player in this axis is the AER, a specialized region of ectoderm found at the distal tip of the limb bud. The AER secretes Fgf, a signalling molecule that promotes the proliferation of underlying mesenchymal cells and their differentiation into various cell types, including chondrocytes and myoblasts. The AER also interacts with the ZPA to regulate the formation of the anterior-posterior axis.
The anterior-posterior axis is responsible for the formation of asymmetrical structures such as the digits and the hand versus the foot. The ZPA, found at the posterior margin of the limb bud, is a signalling centre that secretes Sonic hedgehog (Shh) and sets up a concentration gradient of this signal from high to low levels in an anterior to posterior direction. Shh signalling is essential for the patterning of the anterior-posterior axis by regulating the expression of various transcription factors that promote the formation of different digit types. Specifically, Shh promotes the formation of posterior digits (e.g., digits III, IV, and V) while inhibiting the formation of anterior digits (e.g., digits II and I).
The dorsal-ventral axis is responsible for the formation of the different surfaces of the limb, such as the dorsal and ventral sides of the hand. This axis is established through the interaction between the ectoderm and underlying mesenchyme. In the dorsal region, Wnt7a signalling is essential for the formation of dorsal structures, while in the ventral region, BMP signalling is necessary for ventralization.
The interplay between Fgf and Wnt signalling pathways is crucial for limb development. Activated Fgf signalling in the AER activates the Wnt signalling pathway in the underlying mesenchyme, which is required for the growth and differentiation of mesenchyme into cartilage and bone. Moreover, Wnt signalling induces the expression of Lef1 proteins which, in turn, activate the expression of Fgf8, a critical signalling molecule in limb development.
Current understanding of limb patterning research has shed light on the central regulatory mechanisms of limb development. Recent studies have identified novel signal molecules involved in limb development, such as Wnt5a. Wnt5a is expressed in the dorsal ectoderm and acts to inhibit the Wnt7a signalling in the dorsal mesenchyme, thereby limiting dorsalisation. In contrast, Shh signalling also regulates Wnt expression in the posterior mesenchyme, which contributes to the formation of different digit types. Additionally, there is still much unknown about the mechanisms underlying limb regeneration and the potential manipulation of signals to promote limb regeneration.
In conclusion, the patterning of the vertebrate limb involves the proximal-distal, anterior-posterior, and dorsal-ventral axes, which interact with each other to produce complete and correct morphology. Signalling centers such as the AER and ZPA play essential roles in limb induction and patterning, with the interplay between Fgf and Wnt signalling pathways being crucial. The current understanding of limb patterning research has greatly improved the knowledge of limb development. However, there is still much to learn, and advancements in limb regeneration will require more significant studies to investigate new signal molecules and mechanisms.
