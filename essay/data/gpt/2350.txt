Molybdenum hexacarbonyl is a highly studied molecule in chemistry due to its unique chemical properties and its frequent usage in industrial and laboratory settings. Its substituted derivatives, or molecules in which one or more of the carbonyl capping groups are replaced by another atom or group of atoms, have been the focus of many practical investigations in the past several decades. In this essay, we will examine the focus of these investigations, the characterization of bonding in substituted derivatives of molybdenum hexacarbonyl, and the strategies involved in bonding and their effects on energy levels and vibrations. We will also explore how group theory is used to explain the number of observed vibrational modes and how evidence provided by IR and NMR spectra and X-Ray data supports the delocalized nature of bonding in these complexes.
The focus of practical investigations into substituted derivatives of molybdenum hexacarbonyl is the characterization of the bonding between the central molybdenum atom and the substituent atoms or groups. These investigations aim to determine the electronic structure of the complex, including which orbitals are being used for bonding and how the electronic properties of the substituents affect the nature of the bond. The substituents in these complexes can vary widely, from simple halogens to more complex organic functional groups, allowing for a wide range of structural diversity and electronic properties to be studied. 
Bonding in substituted derivatives of molybdenum hexacarbonyl is characterized by a combination of both covalent and dative bonding. Covalent bonding occurs where electrons are shared between the molybdenum atom and the substituent, while dative bonding occurs when a lone pair of electrons on the substituent is donated to an empty orbital on the molybdenum atom. The nature of the bond varies depending on the substituent, with more electronegative atoms or groups typically exhibiting stronger covalent bonding while less electronegative or electron-donating groups engage in more dative bonding. 
The strategies involved in bonding in these complexes include factors such as orbital hybridization and the electron-withdrawing or -donating properties of the substituent. For example, in a molecule such as molybdenum hexafluoride, the highly electronegative fluorine atoms engage in strong covalent bonding with the molybdenum through the use of hybridized orbitals. In contrast, in a molecule such as molybdenum hexamethyl, the large, electron-donating methyl groups form dative bonds with the molybdenum through the use of unhybridized orbitals. These strategies have significant effects on the energy levels and vibrations of the complexes. 
The energy levels and vibrations of substituted derivatives of molybdenum hexacarbonyl are affected by the nature and strength of the bonding between the molybdenum atom and the substituent. Generally, stronger covalent bonds result in higher energy levels and shorter bond lengths, while dative bonds result in lower energy levels and longer bond lengths. In terms of vibrations, stronger covalent bonds result in higher frequency vibrations, while dative bonds result in lower frequency vibrations. Other factors that can affect energy levels and vibrations include the size of the substituent, the symmetry of the molecule, and the presence of other atoms or groups nearby. 
Group theory is used to explain the number of observed vibrational modes in these complexes. Group theory is a mathematical framework used in chemistry to analyze the symmetry of molecules and predict the number and frequency of their vibrational modes. In substituted derivatives of molybdenum hexacarbonyl, the number of vibrational modes observed depends on the symmetry of the molecule and the number of atoms or groups present. For example, in a molecule with high symmetry such as molybdenum hexacarbonyl itself, there are only 12 unique vibrational modes because many of the modes are related to each other by symmetry. In contrast, in a molecule with lower symmetry due to the presence of substituents, there may be more unique vibrational modes.
Evidence from IR and NMR spectra, as well as X-ray data, supports the delocalized nature of bonding in substituted derivatives of molybdenum hexacarbonyl. In IR spectra, the presence of carbonyl stretching and bending modes indicates the presence of strong covalent bonds between the molybdenum atom and the carbonyl groups. In NMR spectra, the presence of chemical shifts and coupling constants indicates the presence of dative bonds between the molybdenum atom and the substituent. X-ray data provide information about the structure of the complex, including bond angles and lengths, which can be used to confirm the presence of covalent and dative bonds and to study the symmetry of the molecule. Overall, the evidence provided by these techniques indicates that substituted derivatives of molybdenum hexacarbonyl exhibit a highly delocalized nature of bonding, with a combination of covalent and dative bonds between the central atom and the substituents. 
In conclusion, substituted derivatives of molybdenum hexacarbonyl have been the focus of many practical investigations in recent years. Characterizing bonding in these complexes involves studying the electronic structure and strategies involved in bonding, as well as the effects of bonding on energy levels and vibrations. Group theory is used to explain the number of observed vibrational modes, while evidence from IR and NMR spectra and X-ray data confirms the delocalized nature of bonding in these complexes. Understanding the bonding in substituted derivatives of molybdenum hexacarbonyl is important both for applications in industrial and laboratory settings and for advancing our understanding of chemical bonding in general.
