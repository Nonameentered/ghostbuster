Behavioural finance is an interdisciplinary study that combines psychology and economics to analyze the behaviour of investors in financial markets. It departs from traditional academic models of financial markets because it considers the impact of psychological factors on investor decision-making, challenging the traditional assumption that investors are rational and emotionless. As a result, behavioural finance provides a more comprehensive understanding of financial markets and highlights the limitations of traditional models.
One specific departure from traditional academic models of financial markets is the concept of market anomalies, which occur when market prices deviate from their fundamental values due to irrational behaviour by investors. The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), a traditional model of financial markets, assumes that all market participants have access to the same information and act rationally, resulting in market prices reflecting all available information. However, behavioural finance argues that investors often make irrational decisions based on cognitive biases and emotions, leading to market anomalies that invalidate the EMH.
For example, investors often exhibit a behavioural bias known as herding, where they follow the decisions of others instead of conducting their own analysis. This behaviour can lead to market bubbles where prices are inflated far beyond their fundamental value, ultimately resulting in a crash. The EMH is unable to explain these market anomalies, as it assumes that all market participants act rationally based on available information. By contrast, behavioural finance recognizes the presence of irrationality and emotions, leading to market anomalies that challenge the validity of traditional models.
An investment strategy that exploits market anomalies resulting from the malfunction of the EMH is known as a contrarian strategy. This strategy involves buying assets that are undervalued due to market pessimism and selling assets that are overpriced due to market optimism. Contrarian investors take advantage of the market's tendency to overreact and correct its mistakes, generating profits by buying low and selling high.
However, the potential ethical implications of being considered a noise trader need to be considered. Noise traders are investors who do not follow the fundamental principles of investing and instead base their decisions on emotions and popularity. While noise traders may generate short-term gains, they increase market volatility, making it harder for investors to make rational decisions. In other words, behaving like a noise trader may generate profits for an individual, but it negatively impacts market efficiency and market participants in the broader sense.
Technical analysis indicators that support contrarian trading strategies include relative strength indicators and moving averages. Relative strength indicators show the strength of an asset's performance against other assets in its class, while moving averages indicate the average price over a specified period, highlighting trends and potential buying and selling opportunities.
In conclusion, behavioural finance departs from traditional academic models of financial markets by considering psychological factors that impact investor decision-making, leading to market anomalies that challenge the validity of the EMH. A contrarian investment strategy that exploits market anomalies can generate profits, but its effectiveness should be evaluated with the potential ethical implications of being considered a noise trader in mind. Technical analysis indicators can support contrarian strategies, helping investors to identify undervalued assets and market trends.
