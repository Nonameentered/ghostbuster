Pollution is a term used to describe the unwanted and harmful substances that contaminate the environment in which we live. According to Mary Douglas in her book 'Implicit Meanings,' pollution is not just physical waste, but also includes anything that deviates from our social norms and codes of conduct. This can include the violation of social, religious, and cultural norms, as well as the contamination of physical spaces and substances.
The concept of pollution is linked to Durkheim's functionalist theory, which suggests that society works best when its members share common beliefs and values. Durkheim argued that these shared beliefs and values help to maintain social order, as individuals are more likely to follow the rules and norms of society when they feel a strong sense of belonging and collective identity. Pollution, therefore, is seen as a threat to this social order, as it challenges the shared beliefs and values that hold society together.
Pollution is often used as a way of keeping social control and order in societies. By establishing strict rules and norms around what is considered clean and dirty, societies can exert control over individuals and limit their freedom. For example, cleanliness is often used as a marker of social status and hierarchy, with those who are clean and well-groomed seen as more respectable than those who are not. This creates a divide between the clean and dirty, and reinforces existing power structures within society.
Perceptions of dirt and pollution vary across different cultures, and it is important for anthropologists to understand these variations. For example, in some cultures, dirt and pollution are seen as a sign of fertility and growth. In others, they are seen as a sign of decay and death. These differences reflect the unique social and cultural histories of these societies, and reflect the ways in which they adapt to their environments. Anthropologists must remain aware of these variations in order to accurately understand the ways in which different societies approach issues of cleanliness and pollution.
The functions of pollution beliefs are to reinforce the cultural and social structure of society. By establishing strict rules and norms around what is considered clean and dirty, societies are able to exert control over individuals and limit their freedom. This helps to maintain social order and stability, by ensuring that individuals follow the rules and norms of their community.
Pollution beliefs also protect the vulnerable domains of society and help to maintain social order. For example, pollution beliefs often deal with issues of sexuality and bodily functions, which can be potentially threatening to traditional gender roles and ideals. By creating strict rules around these issues, societies are able to protect these domains and prevent potentially destabilizing changes.
In conclusion, pollution is a concept that extends beyond physical waste and contamination. It is a marker of social, religious, and cultural norms, and is used as a way of establishing social control and maintaining order within a society. By understanding the ways in which different cultures and societies approach issues of cleanliness and pollution, anthropologists can gain deeper insights into the unique social and cultural histories of these societies, and understand the ways in which they adapt to their environments. Ultimately, pollution beliefs help to reinforce the cultural and social structure of society, and protect the vulnerable domains of society, helping to maintain social order and stability.
