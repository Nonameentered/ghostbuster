Efficiency wages are a topic of great interest in macroeconomics as they help explain the occurrence of unemployment even when there are job openings. The shirking model of efficiency wages posits that firms may pay their employees a higher wage than what is required in the market to incentivize them to work harder and avoid shirking. This essay will explain how the shirking model of efficiency wage leads to involuntary unemployment and how the relationship between unemployment and wages is predicted by the model. Furthermore, the essay will examine the role of employers and workers in this relationship and the impact of macroeconomic changes on the non-shirking condition, supervision, and effort levels within firms.
The shirking model of efficiency wages is based on the assumption that without monitoring, workers will shirk because the cost of shirking is lower than the benefits. In other words, instead of working hard, workers may choose to put in minimal effort and still receive their salary. In response, firms may offer wages above the market-clearing wage to offset the cost of shirking. This increased wage creates an incentive for workers to work harder and put in more effort to avoid getting fired. The shirking model, therefore, creates an implicit contract between the worker and employer, where the worker is expected to work hard and the employer pays a premium wage to offset the cost of shirking.
However, the shirking model results in involuntary unemployment. This is because the wage premium creates a surplus of labor, which causes the demand for labor to be lower than the supply. As a result, there may be job openings, but some workers may remain unemployed because the wage offered is above the market equilibrium. In other words, the high wage causes a mismatch between labor demand and labor supply, leading to involuntary unemployment.
The shirking model predicts the relationship between unemployment and real wages. As previously mentioned, the higher wage paid by firms incentivizes workers to work harder and avoid shirking. This results in increased production efficiency, which allows firms to pay higher wages. However, the higher wages cause a decrease in labor demand, which results in unemployment. The model predicts that unemployment will increase as wages increase. Therefore, there is a trade-off between higher wages and unemployment.
Employers play a critical role in the relationship between unemployment and real wages. They must determine the optimal wage level that maximizes profit while accounting for the effect of wages on the behavior of workers. If employers offer low wages, workers may shirk, and production efficiency may decrease. This can ultimately lead to lower profits. If employers offer high wages, it may cause unemployment, reducing profits. Therefore, employers must consider the shirking model's trade-off between wages and unemployment to determine the optimal wage.
On the other hand, workers also play a role in the relationship between unemployment and real wages. If workers are willing to work hard and put in more effort than the wage offered, firms will be more likely to pay a higher wage as they can count on increased productivity. However, if workers shirk, firms will be less likely to pay a high wage because workers will not be working efficiently. Therefore, workers must also take into account the trade-off between wages and employment when deciding to work hard or shirk.
Macroeconomic changes can affect the non-shirking condition, supervision, and effort levels within firms. During economic downturns, firms may attempt to save costs by offering lower wages. However, workers may respond by shirking, leading to decreased productivity. Therefore, firms may face declining profits, making it harder to maintain the optimal wage. As a result, the firm may hire fewer workers or even layoff existing workers, leading to unemployment.
In contrast, if the economy is doing well, firms may offer higher wages as there is greater demand for goods and services. Workers may respond by working harder, leading to increased productivity. This can boost profits, causing firms to hire additional workers, leading to a decrease in unemployment. Therefore, macroeconomic factors can affect the optimal wage, the level of supervision, and the effort level within firms.
In conclusion, the shirking model of efficiency wages provides an explanation for the occurrence of involuntary unemployment. The model posits that firms may pay higher wages to incentivize workers to work harder and avoid shirking. However, the higher wage can create a surplus of labor, causing unemployment. The relationship between unemployment and real wages is predicted by the model; as wages increase, unemployment increases. Employers and workers play a role in this relationship by deciding on the optimal wage and whether to work hard or shirk. Finally, macroeconomic changes can affect the non-shirking condition, supervision level, and effort level within firms.
