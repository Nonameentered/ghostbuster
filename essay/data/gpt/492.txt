The Sino-Japanese relationship is a complex and historically charged issue. Japan’s imperialistic past, particularly during the World War II era, has continued to impact its relationships with neighboring countries, particularly China. One bone of contention between the two countries is Japan’s portrayal of its wartime history in school textbooks. This issue has been covered extensively by the Sino-Japanese press. But, the nature of press coverage in Sino-Japanese press reporting raises questions about media bias and its impact on readers’ perception of the issue.
Over the past several years, Sino-Japanese press outlets have been embroiled in a controversy centered on history textbooks. The focus of the media attention has been Japan’s repeated attempts to revise its portrayal of its wartime history in textbooks. According to China’s state-run Xinhua News Agency, Japan has made at least 38 changes to its junior high school textbooks to remove references to the forced recruitment of Korean and Chinese women into prostitution for Japanese soldiers during World War II. The issue is considered particularly contentious in China due to the large number of Chinese women who were forced to serve as sex slaves for the Japanese military during the war.
Controversies surrounding the revised history textbooks have been frequently reported on in the Sino-Japanese press. Chinese media outlets have regularly published articles critical of Japan’s continued attempts to whitewash its war crimes, and Japan’s nationalistic right-wing media have been criticized for fanning the flames of the controversy. Coverage on state-owned Chinese media outlets such as Xinhua News Agency, People’s Daily, and CCTV is known for being critical of Japan and its government. The coverage often accentuates Japan’s wrongdoing during World War II and portrays the Communist Party's stance on the issue, which is unquestionably biased in favor of China.
Japanese media outlets, on the other hand, have a different view on the issue. Right-wing media outlets like Sankei Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun portray the idea of Japan as the victim of international bullying led by China’s one-sided reportage of the issue. The Japanese press, particularly conservative outlets, often accuse China of manipulating the issue for political gain. The Japanese government could not maintain silence in such a delicate matter. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has dismissed claims of Japan’s wartime history as incorrect and misleading. This coverage reinforces nationalistic sentiments within its readership and deflects criticism of Japan’s imperialistic ventures and aggression during World War II.
Media bias in reporting the issue has had a significant impact on readers’ perception of the issue. Readers of the Sino-Japanese press outlets tend to be polarized, with Chinese readers supporting the Chinese government's stance, and Japanese readers supporting their own government. Both sides reinforce preexisting prejudices and nationalistic fervors rather than informing objective discourse.
Many readers of the Sino-Japanese press are not only consumers of the media, but they are also influenced by it as well. The Chinese government promotes nationalism in its media coverage strategically. It is part of their efforts to rally support within the country and internationally while projecting their soft power. The Chinese government's portrayal of Japan's history in textbooks is unlikely to be a genuine interest in justice regarding historical issues. It is an effort to further undermine Japan’s reputation by playing the victim, which will deflect attention from their domestic issues. 
As for Japan, conservative news outlets such as Sankei Shimbun and Yomiuri Shimbun have been criticized for ignoring Japan's past in their coverage of the textbook controversy. Their coverage portrays Japan as the victim of Chinese aggression, insulating the audience from any criticism of the past. This kind of coverage ignores Japan's past imperialistic ventures and aggression.
There are instances when press coverage can shift the balance of power in dealing with historical disputes like Japan’s history in textbooks. Coverage, especially from state-owned media, could influence how international audiences view any given country, leading to increased global pressure and international criticism. In the face of the Sino-Japanese dispute, the international community’s treatment of the issue could have gradually started to shift towards greater support for China’s position.
In conclusion, the Sino-Japanese press’s coverage of Japan's history textbook controversy remains divisive and contentious. The nationalistic leanings of both the Chinese and Japanese press outlets do not help to facilitate objective discourse and open dialogue about important historical issues. Press coverage reflects the prevailing nationalistic and moral attitudes held by the respective parties. This mindset further polarizes and reinforces preexisting biases and eliminates any hope of a dialogue that could yield a real and productive debate. Instead, it creates division, foments trust issues, and ensconces a historical controversy, ensuring that the wounds of the past continue to fester in the present.
