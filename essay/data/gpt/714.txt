During a laboratory session, the method used to find the moment of inertia of three metal discs of different sizes involved the use of a torsion pendulum and a graphing software. The theory used for the calculations was based on the principle of rotational motion, which states that the moment of inertia is a measure of an object's resistance to rotational motion and is dependent on the object's mass distribution around a rotational axis.
To begin the experiment, the three metal discs were mounted vertically on the torsion pendulum and set into motion. The pendulum's oscillation was recorded with a motion sensor and the data was graphed using LoggerPro software. The torsion constant of the pendulum was determined by measuring the period of oscillation and the moment of inertia of the pendulum was calculated by using the torsion constant, the period of oscillation, and the moment of inertia of a known object.
Next, the moment of inertia of each metal disc was calculated by fitting the data into the equation for a torsion pendulum using the graphing software. This involved plotting the period of oscillation against the square root of the moment of inertia for each disc. The slope of the resulting line was equal to the torsion constant divided by the total moment of inertia of the pendulum and the known object. The moment of inertia of each metal disc was then calculated by using the torsion constant and the total moment of inertia of the pendulum, known object, and metal disc.
The results obtained from the experiment showed that the moment of inertia increased with the diameter of the metal disc. This was expected, as the mass distribution of the disc increases with diameter, leading to higher rotational inertia. However, there were possible sources of error in the experiment that could have affected the results. These included air resistance, friction, and imperfections in the metal discs. These errors could have led to inaccurate measurements and calculations, which could have affected the accuracy of the results obtained.
In conclusion, the method used to find the moment of inertia of three metal discs of different sizes during the laboratory session involved the use of a torsion pendulum and graphing software. The theory used for the calculations was based on the principle of rotational motion, and the graphs were used to fit the values derived into the equation. Despite potential sources of error, the results obtained showed that the moment of inertia increased with the diameter of the metal discs.
