Introduction
Governance in Europe is a complex concept that has been debated for decades. There are two normative conceptions of governance in Europe that have been at play in recent timesâ€”the technocratic and democratic approaches. The technocratic approach is focused on efficiency, rationality, and expertise, whereas the democratic approach emphasizes transparency, accountability, and participation. This essay will examine the two normative conceptions of governance in Europe and how they relate to the European Union's legitimacy crisis. Additionally, it will explore how the lack of a common European identity contributes to this crisis and propose solutions to address the issue of legitimacy.
Two Normative Conceptions of Governance in Europe and their Relationship to the EU Legitimacy Crisis
The technocratic approach to governance emphasizes technical expertise and rational decision-making. In this approach, decisions are made by experts who hold positions of power based on their technical competence. The technocratic approach has been prominent in the European Union's decision-making processes, where unelected officials and experts make significant decisions impacting the lives of people who have no authority to make decisions (Featherstone, 2018). This approach has led to a democratic deficit, where citizens lack direct participation in the decision-making process and feel disconnected from the governance of the EU.
The democratic approach to governance emphasizes participation, transparency, and accountability in decision-making processes. In this approach, ordinary citizens have an active role in governance and decision making. Democratic governance requires policymakers to be responsive to the views and concerns of the citizens they serve. Democratic governance aims to strengthen citizens' voice over their interests and gives them an opportunity to make decisions on policy matters that affect their lives. The use of this approach would help to improve the EU's legitimacy, which has been close to being questioned due to the perception that the EU is too distant and disconnected from its citizens.
The legitimacy crisis in the EU has been caused by a democratic deficit resulting from the technocratic approach to governance at EU levels. This crisis is characterized by a lack of trust that EU citizens have in the EU institutions and the EU itself. The democratic deficit is attributed to the lack of participation and accountability of the EU institutions towards the citizens. This crisis of legitimacy is evident through the falling turnout in European Parliament elections and referendums, which also indicates that citizens feel that the EU is far from attention and nonexistence.
The lack of a Common European Identity and its Contribution to the Crisis of Legitimacy in the EU
The lack of a common European identity has played a significant role in the EU's legitimacy crisis. Europe is not a single nation; it is composed of several distinct cultures and identities. These European cultures and identities differ significantly, and this has led to a lack of a common European identity. Therefore, the EU can be seen more as an economic and political construct rather than a common identity. This lack of a common European identity has contributed to the crisis of legitimacy in the EU because citizens feel a lack of connection with the EU.
The lack of a common European identity makes it difficult for EU citizens to understand the EU's institutions' motives, processes, and policies. There is no feeling of belonging to a united Europe because people feel their identities and traditions are overshadowed by the larger collective European identity. It often appears that the EU is too far and disconnected from its citizens due to the lack of a common European identity. The absence of a community identity can lead to a lack of political representation and a sense of Euro-skepticism.
Solutions Proposed to Address the Issue of Legitimacy and Their Effectiveness
To address the issue of legitimacy in the EU, it is necessary to propose solutions that can address the democratic deficit and lack of a common European identity. Several solutions have been suggested. One solution is to increase the level of transparency and accountability in EU decision-making processes. This solution involves making EU decision-making processes more transparent and increasing citizens' participation in decision making. This solution would improve the EU's legitimacy by making citizens feel like they have a direct role in governance.
Another solution is to create a more common European identity. This solution involves the unity of Europe rather than the concentration of the already existing differences. It emphasizes the need to embrace diversity and develop cohesion in the European continent. This can be done by promoting cultural exchange programs, emphasizing Europe's common heritage, and enhancing the EU's social policies.
The political-economic solution to the EU legitimacy crisis involves closer integration of EU institutions, such as the creation of a financial and political union. This solution would require significant institutional reforms, as the EU's power base would have to be significantly strengthened. This solution would help to prevent economic and political fragmentation across Europe and create a more well-respected EU.
Conclusion
In conclusion, there are two normative conceptions of governance in Europe - the technocratic and democratic approaches. The technocratic approach emphasizes efficiency, rationality, and expertise, while the democratic approach emphasizes transparency, accountability, and participation. The EU's legitimacy crisis is caused by a democratic deficit resulting from the technocratic approach to governance at EU levels. A lack of common European identity contributes to this crisis. However, increasing transparency in EU decision-making processes, building a common European identity, and promoting closer integration of EU institutions are potential solutions to the issue of legitimacy in the EU. These efforts would help renew citizens' trust in the EU institutions, enable public accountability, and provide closer integration between different EU member states.
