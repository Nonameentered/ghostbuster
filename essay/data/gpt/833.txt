Introduction
Oxford Brookes University is one of the leading universities in the UK, providing quality education to both local and international students. With a large number of international students in attendance, communication with English students is essential for both academic and social integration. This essay will explore the extent to which international students communicate with English students in the university and the effectiveness of participating in an exchange program. Additionally, it will provide suggestions for improving the situation.
Communication between International and English Students
Communication between international and English students at Oxford Brookes University varies among individuals. Some international students are fluent in English, while others struggle to communicate effectively due to language barriers. In many cases, the lack of effective communication is a result of cultural differences. English students, for instance, may find it challenging to socialize with international students who adhere to unique cultural practices, whereas international students may feel isolated and disconnected from their English counterparts.
The majority of international students who attend Oxford Brookes come from non-English-speaking countries and as such, language and cultural barriers can be significant obstacles to establishing a meaningful connection. International students often have to learn English upon arrival to the UK, which in itself is a time-consuming process. In some cases, English students may not actively seek to communicate with international students, opting instead to connect with those who share similar backgrounds and speak the same language. This further exacerbates the situation, leaving international students feeling marginalized and disconnected from the university community.
Effectiveness of Exchange Programs
Exchange programs are designed to promote cultural exchange and enhance communication between students from different countries. At Oxford Brookes, exchange programs provide international students with the opportunity to study in the UK for a semester or two, while English students can study abroad at one of the universityâ€™s partner institutions. These programs offer various benefits, including increased cultural awareness, language proficiency, and personal growth.
Participating in an exchange program can help international students improve their language skills significantly, as they are immersed in an English-speaking environment. Through daily interactions with English students, international students can learn the language and improve their communication skills. Additionally, exchange programs offer opportunities for cross-cultural interactions and experiences. They enable students to learn about different cultures, traditions, and customs, which broadens their perspectives and encourages international understanding.
Moreover, participating in exchange programs can also help students develop essential transferable skills that employers value, such as adaptability, problem-solving, critical thinking, and intercultural competence. These benefits make exchange programs an effective tool for fostering communication between international and English students at Oxford Brookes University.
Improving Communication between International and English Students
To improve communication between international and English students, there is a need to create a more inclusive community that actively promotes cross-cultural interactions and opportunities. Here are some suggestions for improving the situation:
1. Increase Awareness: Awareness-raising activities are critical for promoting cross-cultural interactions and communication. The university can organize events that promote cultural exchange or collaborations between international and English students. Such events could include cultural festivals, language exchanges, or social events that encourage students to share their experiences and perspectives.
2. Language Support: English language support should be provided to aid international students in improving their language proficiency. The university can organize language exchange programs that connect international students with English students interested in learning foreign languages.
3. Mentorship Programs: Mentorship programs should be created to link international and English students. These programs could be designed to pair international students with English students who have a common interest or share a similar background. These connections would provide a supportive and welcoming environment for international students to integrate better into the university community.
4. Study Groups: Study groups should be created that include international and English students. This would encourage peer-to-peer learning and dialogue, enabling students to clarify misunderstandings or cultural differences that may hinder communication.
Conclusion
In conclusion, communication with English students at Oxford Brookes University varies among international students, and as such, cultural and language barriers exist. However, participating in exchange programs can help foster communication between international and English students, promoting cross-cultural interactions, language proficiency, and personal growth. To improve communication between international and English students, the university should consider creating awareness-raising activities, English language support, mentorship programs, and study groups. These actions create a more inclusive community that actively promotes cross-cultural interactions and opportunities. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize these recommendations so that international students can feel welcomed and included in the university community.
