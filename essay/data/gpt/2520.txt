The concept of experiential learning has gained immense popularity in recent years as it helps students gain practical knowledge in their respective fields. As part of our curriculum, we had the opportunity to experience the weather patterns during the "Experiencing the Weather" field weekend near Swanage, Dorset, in southern England in 2006. The weekend was designed to provide us with a better understanding of the weather patterns and the various factors that contribute to change in the air temperature and humidity. In this essay, we will discuss the different weather patterns observed during the weekend, the factors that influenced these patterns, and the implications of these findings for our understanding of weather patterns in coastal areas and regions with large water bodies.
The "Experiencing the Weather" field weekend took place from 24th to 26th March 2006 in Swanage, Dorset, a coastal region in southern England. During this period, we observed a range of weather patterns ranging from bright sunshine to occasionally cloudy conditions, and on one day, we experienced rain. The temperature in the region during our stay was relatively chilly, and we noticed that the temperature varied throughout the day. The mornings and late afternoons were colder than midday, which was the warmest part of the day.
The coastal location of Swanage played a significant role in determining the weather patterns we observed during the weekend. The wind direction and speed significantly affected the temperature and humidity conditions throughout the duration of the program. The direction of the wind was mainly from the southwest, and we noted that this led to variations in temperature and humidity levels. This was evident as the air temperature would decrease rapidly whenever the wind blew in from the sea. As such, the weather patterns were heavily dependent on the prevailing winds, which significantly influenced the temperature and humidity levels, thereby affecting the overall weather conditions.
One of the most significant contributing factors to the observed changes in the air temperature and humidity levels was the phenomenon of sea breeze. According to our observations, during the day, the temperature near the coast was cooler than that experienced further inland, while at night, the situation reversed. This was primarily due to the movement of the sea breeze. During the day, the sea breeze would move from the sea towards the land, pushing colder air towards the coast. This resulted in cooler temperatures along the coast compared to in-land areas. Conversely, at night, warmer air moved from the land towards the coast, as the land cooled faster than the sea, leading to warmer temperatures near the coast.
Another factor that contributed to the changes in temperature and humidity was the amount of cloud cover. We observed that on days when there was more cloud cover, the weather was cooler. This was because the clouds blocked the sun's rays, reducing the amount of heat reaching the surface. Additionally, when the cloud cover was low, the temperature was higher. However, this effect was mostly experienced during the day because the clouds would prevent the sun from warming the Earth's surface.
Different student groups gathered data on various weather parameters during the program, including air temperature, wind speed, humidity, and cloud cover. The data gathered by these groups provided valuable insights into the variability of weather patterns observed during the weekend. One group studied the effects of wind speed and direction on temperature and humidity levels, while another group focused on how the temperature varied during the day.
The data collected showed that there was a significant correlation between the wind direction and temperature. The air temperature increased when the wind was blowing from land instead of the sea, while it decreased when the wind was blowing from the sea. The data also revealed that the relative humidity levels tended to increase during the day along the coastlines due to the onset of sea breeze, leading to the formation of clouds and occasional rainfall.
The information gathered by the different groups during the program provides insightful implications for understanding weather patterns in coastal areas and regions with large water bodies. The study shows that the temperature and humidity levels are significantly influenced by the sea breeze and wind direction. In situations where there are large water bodies close to the coast, the wind direction plays a crucial role in determining the temperature and humidity levels, and it is evident from the experiment that the prevailing winds play a dominant role in changing weather patterns in such areas.
During the weekend, we generated tephigrams, a diagram illustrating the stability of air in the atmosphere. The tephigrams showed variations in the atmospheric conditions at different levels of the atmosphere, providing insights into the stability of the atmosphere over the study area during this time period. Specifically, the tephigrams helped in understanding the changes in the air temperature and humidity levels throughout the program.
One of the key features of the tephigrams was the temperature inversion line, which was a sharp increase in temperature at certain levels of the atmosphere. This line showed that the surface temperature was cooler than the temperature at certain heights in the atmosphere. The data also revealed that the atmosphere was stable during the weekend, implying that there was little or no turbulence in the atmosphere. The stability of the atmosphere was evident from the tephigrams, as the temperature gradually increased with altitude.
In conclusion, our observations during the "Experiencing the Weather" field weekend near Swanage, Dorset, in southern England in 2006 reveal that weather patterns are significantly influenced by the prevailing winds, temperature, and humidity levels, which are amplified along the coastlines. The sea breeze played a crucial role in changing temperature and humidity levels, causing variations in weather. The data collected provides valuable insights into the variability of weather patterns in coastal areas and regions with large water bodies. The tephigrams generated illustrate the stability of the atmosphere over the study area during this time, reaffirming that there was little or no turbulence in the atmosphere during the period. Overall, the "Experiencing the Weather" field program was an insightful and educational experience that provided practical knowledge in understanding weather patterns.
