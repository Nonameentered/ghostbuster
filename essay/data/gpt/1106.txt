Plutarch, the ancient Greek historian and biographer, uses the end of the Life of Pericles to highlight the virtues of the Athenian leader and defend him against accusations of being a demagogue, while simultaneously employing his techniques to do so. In this essay, I will examine Plutarch's portrayal of Pericles, his defense of Pericles against charges of being a demagogue, and how he uses Pericles' own rhetoric and strategies to achieve effective persuasion.
Throughout the Life of Pericles, Plutarch consistently characterizes Pericles as a man of great virtue, who worked tirelessly towards the betterment of Athens. In the closing section of the Life, Plutarch further accentuates these virtues by emphasizing Pericles' intrinsic humility and genuine empathy for the people of Athens. Plutarch highlights Pericles' humility by recounting how he ordered a friend to "bury him where he [Pericles] should chance to fall in battle" without any grandiose memorial, so that he could be treated as any other soldier on the battlefield. This act reinforces Plutarch's image of Pericles as a modest and selfless man, putting the needs and interests of his fellow Athenians above his own.
Furthermore, Plutarch portrays Pericles as a leader who genuinely cared for the common people of Athens, a trait that was obscured by the accusations of being a demagogue. Pericles, according to Plutarch, "was an excellent orator, and one that knew how to touch the people's passions, and knew the strength and the weakness of every argument." Plutarch acknowledges that the people of Athens were easily swayed by Pericles' impassioned speeches but argues that Pericles utilized his powerful rhetoric to advance the city's welfare and not for his own benefit. Plutarch describes how Pericles "did not aim so much to please as to lead the people" and that his ultimate goal was to sustain the "glory and power of the city of Athens." These virtuous characterizations of Pericles are ultimately supported by Plutarch's reference to the Athenian funeral oration.
In the funeral oration, Pericles praises Athenian democracy, highlighting the virtues of the system and the moral superiority of Athens. Plutarch uses this speech to defend Pericles against charges of being a demagogue. He points out that Pericles values "free speech, which, though it was sometimes unfortunate, yet was necessary" to the functioning of Athenian democracy. Plutarch interprets this as Pericles not only supporting democracy, but also recognizing the potential for criticism and much-needed introspection that comes with it. Presenting Pericles as someone who recognized the flaws of democracy yet still wholeheartedly supported it, Plutarch rebuts the accusations of being a demagogue, insincere in his concern for the Athenian people.
Plutarch also employs Pericles' rhetorical techniques to demonstrate his virtues and defend him against accusations of being a demagogue. Pericles was a talented orator who knew how to sway the people, but he did so in a way that was simultaneously beneficial to Athens and its people. Plutarch identifies several tactics that Pericles employed in his orations that emphasized his virtuous character. For instance, Plutarch notes that Pericles appealed to the emotions of the people, but he did so in a way that highlighted his concern for them, rather than exploiting their emotions for his own benefit. Plutarch explains how, even when the Athenians were reluctant to fight, Pericles did not use fear or anger to compel them to battle. As an alternative, Pericles focused on what they stood to gain from their victory, emphasizing how glory and honor would serve to elevate Athens.
Not only did Pericles rationalize the potential costs of war and highlight the benefits that would come from it, but he also presented a compelling vision of Athens as a city of unprecedented power and welfare. Uniting the Athenians around this vision, Pericles employed highly emotional language in describing the Athens of his vision while avoiding any ploying at their sentiments for his own benefit. He describes how "there is not a land…it has not heard of Athens," and how the widespread admiration of the Athenians means that "we shall leave behind us eternal monuments of glory." By instilling this sense of pride and purpose in the Athenians, Pericles succeeded in creating an emotional connection of the Athenians to their city while simultaneously highlighting his selflessness and virtuous character.
Furthermore, Plutarch suggests that Pericles was tactful in his words and actions. Looking at how Pericles used both his rhetoric and his decisions, Plutarch portrays him as capable of reasoning out what he will say and do as a politician who bridges the various political camps in Athens. Plutarch notes how Pericles aimed to woo factions and bring them together, instead of favouring one against the other, which speaks more to his shrewdness than his love of democracy. By portraying Pericles as someone who could use rhetoric and rhetoric as a tool for reconciliation among Athenians, Plutarch strengthens the perception of him as a virtuous and insightful politician and not just a demagogue.
All of these techniques underscore Plutarch's efforts to defend Pericles against sedition and challenge the lie that he was simply a demagogue. Demonstration of such virtuous characters coupled with personal humility and empathy for the people, Blunt opponents' charges and justify Pericles's reputation for sound leadership. Employing his virtuous defence tactics and instances of Pericles’ own techniques ensures Plutarch's view of Pericles does not seem clearly biased but rather one based on credible research.
In conclusion, Plutarch uses the end of the Life of Pericles to portray him as a virtuous leader, defend him against charges of being a demagogue and utilize his techniques to achieve effective persuasion himself. Plutarch does all of this by highlighting Pericles' unique combination of qualities that enabled him to succeed in Athens, particularly his abilities as an orator and his sense of empathy towards the Athenian people. By representing Pericles as a virtuous leader caught in the crossfire of political controversy, Plutarch contributes to the rich legacy of Pericles, and the role he played in making Athens what it was to become.
