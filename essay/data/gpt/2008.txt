Discourse analysis is the study of language use in different situations and by different groups of people. It involves the detailed examination of spoken and written language to understand how it is structured and how it functions in different contexts. It is an interdisciplinary field that draws on linguistics, sociology, anthropology, psychology and communication studies. This essay will discuss the methods used to compare and contrast an example of conversational talk with an extract from a political radio interview, and why transcription is important in this process. It will also explore how the Ethnography of Speaking approach contributes to the analysis of spoken discourse and what tools are used to describe the components of speech events. Finally, it will examine the differences in the speech situations, events, and acts of the two examples of discourse and how they align with Hymes' SPEAKING Grid.
Transcription is an essential tool for discourse analysis. It involves the accurate and detailed representation of spoken language in written form. Transcription allows researchers to analyze and compare spoken language across different contexts and to identify features of language use that are characteristic of particular groups of speakers. In the case of comparing and contrasting conversational talk and political radio interviews, transcription allows researchers to identify patterns of interaction, turn-taking, and negotiation of meaning.
When comparing conversational talk with a political radio interview, there are several methods that can be used. The first is to examine the structure of the conversations. Conversational talk is typically less structured than interviews, with speakers frequently interrupting and overlapping their speech. In contrast, interviews are more structured, with a clear separation between the interviewer and interviewee. In addition, interviews are often conducted with a specific purpose in mind, such as gathering information for a news story or political campaign. This purpose influences the structure of the interview and the language used by the interviewer and interviewee.
Another method for comparing and contrasting conversational talk and political radio interviews is to examine the discursive strategies used by speakers. Discursive strategies are the ways in which speakers use language to achieve a particular goal or to influence the opinions of their audience. In conversational talk, speakers often use a variety of strategies, such as humor, sarcasm, and storytelling, to engage their listeners and build rapport. In a political interview, the interviewee may use strategies such as rhetorical repetition, evasion, or deflection, to avoid answering difficult questions or to redirect the conversation towards a particular topic.
The Ethnography of Speaking approach is a valuable tool for analyzing spoken discourse. This approach emphasizes the importance of studying language use within its cultural context and examines the social and cultural factors that influence language use. The Ethnography of Speaking approach involves identifying the different components of speech events, such as the participants, the setting, the goals of the speech event, and the speech acts involved.
The Ethnography of Speaking approach also involves identifying the different genres of speech events. Genres are the different types of speech events that occur in a particular community of speakers. For example, the genre of a political interview may be different from the genre of a family conversation or a workplace meeting. Identifying the different genres of speech events is important because it allows researchers to understand the specific linguistic features and discursive strategies that are characteristic of each genre.
To describe the components of speech events, the Ethnography of Speaking approach uses a number of tools, including the SPEAKING Grid developed by Dell Hymes. The SPEAKING Grid is a framework for describing the different components of speech events, including the setting, the participants, the ends, the acts, the key, the instrumentalities, the norms, and the genres. The SPEAKING Grid can be used to analyze different types of speech events, including conversations, interviews, and other forms of spoken discourse.
When comparing and contrasting the speech situations, events, and acts of conversational talk and political radio interviews, we can use the SPEAKING Grid to identify the similarities and differences between them. For example, in terms of the setting, both conversational talk and political interviews may take place in informal or formal settings, but the goals of the speech event and the roles of the participants may differ. In terms of the participants, the number of speakers and their roles may differ in conversational talk and political interviews. In terms of the ends or goals of the speech event, political interviews are often conducted with the goal of gathering information or influencing opinions, while conversational talk may have a more social or interpersonal goal.
In terms of the speech acts involved, the types of speech acts and discursive strategies used may differ. In conversational talk, speakers may use a variety of speech acts, such as apologies, invitations, or requests, while in political interviews, speakers may use discursive strategies such as repetition or evasiveness to achieve their goals.
In conclusion, comparing and contrasting conversational talk with political radio interviews involves examining the structure of the conversations, identifying the discursive strategies used, and analyzing the different components of speech events. The Ethnography of Speaking approach provides a valuable tool for analyzing spoken discourse, by emphasizing the importance of studying language use within its cultural context and identifying the social and cultural factors that influence language use. By using the SPEAKING Grid to describe the components of speech events, we can identify the similarities and differences between conversational talk and political interviews and better understand the speech situations, events, and acts involved.
