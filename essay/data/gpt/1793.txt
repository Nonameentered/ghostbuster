The Monarka Hotel unit in Kathmandu, Nepal, is a rapidly growing business venture with immense potential for success in the hospitality industry. As the hotel unit continues to expand, it is crucial to develop effective people management strategies that align with Nepalese cultural and social norms while optimizing organizational outcomes. This essay explores the potential people management strategies for the Monarka Hotel unit in Kathmandu, Nepal, the differences between Nepal's business environment and the UK's, the major divergences, and the most suitable approach to workforce management.
To start with, potential people management strategies for the Monarka Hotel unit in Kathmandu, Nepal, include implementing a cross-functional team structure, emphasizing employee empowerment, and fostering a supportive and collaborative work environment. A cross-functional team structure can help to break down silos and enhance communication and collaboration across various departments within the organization. This can lead to better decision-making, improved problem-solving capabilities, and increased innovation and creativity. Additionally, emphasizing employee empowerment can help to build trust and improve job satisfaction, leading to higher productivity, lower absenteeism, and ultimately, better business outcomes. Finally, fostering a supportive and collaborative work environment can help to attract and retain top talent, create a positive organizational culture, and improve staff morale and job satisfaction.
Moreover, Nepal's business environment differs significantly from that of the UK, primarily in terms of its legal and institutional frameworks, cultural and societal norms, and economic and political stability. Nepal's legal and institutional frameworks, including labor laws, corporate governance rules, and taxation policies, are less developed and less stringent than those of the UK, which can pose significant challenges for foreign investors. Additionally, Nepal's cultural and societal norms, including a collectivist and hierarchical orientation, can have implications for people management. For instance, Nepalese employees may expect a high level of guidance and direction from their superiors and may place value on personal relationships over professional skills and experience. Finally, Nepal's economic and political stability is comparatively lower than the UK, with frequent political instability, natural disasters, and infrastructural constraints, which can impede business operations and result in uncertainty.
Consequently, the major divergences between the UK and Nepal's business environments require a tailored approach to workforce management for the Monarka Hotel unit in Kathmandu, Nepal. While both human resource management (HRM) and personnel management (PM) may be applicable, HRM is the most suitable approach for Monarka in Nepal. HRM emphasizes the strategic alignment of people management practices with organizational objectives and goals, recognizes the importance of employee empowerment, and adopts a proactive and flexible approach to people management. These principles align with the potential people management strategies for Monarka in Nepal, which emphasize a cross-functional team structure, employee empowerment, and a supportive and collaborative work environment. Furthermore, HRM can help to manage the challenges posed by Nepal's less developed legal and institutional frameworks, by providing a structured and systematic approach to employee management and development.
In conclusion, the Monarka Hotel unit in Kathmandu, Nepal, has significant potential for success in the hospitality industry. However, to achieve this success, effective people management strategies that are aligned with Nepalese societal and cultural norms and optimized for organizational outcomes are crucial. Potential strategies for Monarka in Nepal include adopting a cross-functional team structure, emphasizing employee empowerment, and fostering a supportive and collaborative work environment.
