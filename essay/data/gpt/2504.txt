Carphone Warehouse's web service faces major usability issues that affect customer satisfaction. Firstly, the website's loading time is slow, which leads to frustration and increased bounce rates. Secondly, their website lacks a search bar and filter options, making it difficult for customers to find what they are looking for. Lastly, the checkout process is not user-friendly, with long forms and unclear instructions. To improve customer satisfaction, Carphone Warehouse can enhance their website by improving its speed and providing search and filter options. Additionally, they can simplify the checkout process by integrating payment options and ensuring clear instructions throughout the process. By addressing these usability issues, they can offer a more enjoyable experience for their customers, leading to increased sales and loyalty.
