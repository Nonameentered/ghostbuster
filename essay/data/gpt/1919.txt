Agar plates are widely used to culture microorganisms, and it is critical to ensure that the plates' surface is dry before streaking. Drying the surface ensures that the bacteria are uniformly distributed and cannot be carried away to other areas when inoculating. Any moisture present on the surface may interfere with the growth of bacteria and may lead to the formation of contaminated colonies. Incubating plates upside down helps in preventing moisture from building up on the surface of the agar.
The streaking method used is the quadrant streaking method. The purpose of this method is to obtain isolated bacterial colonies. The four quadrants are inoculated serially, decreasing in bacterial density from the first to the fourth quadrant. This method makes it possible to separate bacterial colonies by increasing the distance between adjacent bacterial cells and diluting individual bacterial cells, resulting in the formation of isolated colonies. The isolated colonies are then isolated, and their pure culture can be obtained for further studies.
Typical bacterial colonies appear circular or irregular in shape and are raised, smooth, and opaque. Under the microscope, individual colonies appear as discrete, separate clusters of bacterial cells. Mould colonies are a visible mass of filaments suspended in a liquid medium. Mould colonies may assume different shapes depending on the type of mould present and the prevailing environmental conditions.
In conclusion, drying of agar plates is necessary before streaking, and plates must be incubated inverted to prevent moisture from accumulating. The quadrant streaking method is used to obtain isolated bacterial colonies. The typical plan view of bacterial colonies is circular, raised, smooth, and opaque, while mould colonies assume different shapes. Bacterial colonies' separation aids in pure culture production, and this technique is widely used in diagnostic laboratories, research institutions and various industries.
