Carbon steel is one of the most widely used materials in the manufacturing industry, owing to its exceptional properties such as durability, strength and corrosion resistance. However, the properties of carbon steel can vary depending on the manufacturing process and the composition of the alloy. In order to effectively select carbon steel for different applications, it is important to test its properties and gain a comprehensive understanding of its performance characteristics. This essay will discuss the methods used to test the properties of selected carbon steel specimens and analyze whether a real variation in the properties can be identified from the experimental data collected in 1995 and 1998.
To investigate the properties of carbon steel, a number of tests are carried out on the specimens. The most common tests include tensile testing, hardness testing, impact testing, and corrosion testing. The tensile test is used to determine the yield strength, elongation, and ultimate tensile strength of the material. The hardness test is used to measure the resistance of the material to indentation and scratching. Impact testing is used to determine the toughness of the material to sudden shocks or impacts. Lastly, corrosion testing evaluates the resistance of the material to chemical attack and corrosion.
In the experimental study of the properties of carbon steel carried out in 1995 and 1998, the specimens were tested for their tensile strength, yield strength, elongation, hardness, and impact resistance. The experiments were carried out using an Instron Universal testing machine to carry out the tensile and hardness tests, while the Charpy Impact test was used for the impact testing. The specimens were tested in accordance with various international test standards, including ASTM, DIN, and JIS.
The tensile test was conducted by applying a gradually increasing load to the specimen until it failed. The yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation were then calculated based on the recorded values of load, strain, and displacement. In the 1995 tests, the yield strength ranged from 340 MPa to 401 MPa, with an average value of 371 MPa. The ultimate tensile strength ranged from 625 MPa to 738 MPa, with an average value of 679 MPa. The percentage of elongation ranged from 14% to 26%, with an average value of 21%. In the 1998 tests, the yield strength ranged from 344 MPa to 405 MPa, with an average value of 382 MPa. The ultimate tensile strength ranged from 621 MPa to 733 MPa, with an average value of 671 MPa. The percentage of elongation ranged from 12% to 25%, with an average value of 19%.
The hardness test was carried out by applying a load to the surface of the specimen using a diamond indenter. The indentation depth was then recorded, and the Vickers hardness number was calculated based on the applied load and the area of the indentation. In the 1995 tests, the Vickers hardness number ranged from 200 HV to 283 HV, with an average value of 248 HV. In the 1998 tests, the Vickers hardness number ranged from 197 HV to 289 HV, with an average value of 249 HV.
The impact test was carried out using the Charpy Impact test. The specimen was held in a fixture, and a hammer was raised to a specific height before being released to swing down and strike the specimen. The energy absorbed by the specimen was then recorded. In the 1995 tests, the impact energy ranged from 16 J to 32 J, with an average value of 23 J. In the 1998 tests, the impact energy ranged from 17 J to 31 J, with an average value of 23 J.
From the experimental data collected in 1995 and 1998, it is evident that there is a range in the properties of carbon steel specimens, both between specimens tested at different times, and within specimens tested at the same time. For instance, the yield strength of specimens ranged between 340 MPa to 401 MPa in 1995 and from 344 MPa to 405 MPa in 1998. Similarly, the Vickers hardness number ranged from 200 HV to 283 HV in 1995 and from 197 HV to 289 HV in 1998. The variation in the properties may be attributed to inconsistencies in the materials and techniques used in manufacturing the specimens, as well as variations in the testing procedures and equipment used. While some of the variability may be attributed to random error, it is important to note that different levels of variation could be observed between tests conducted in different years. This could be due to improvements in testing methods, personnel or equipment.
There are some limitations to the study that need to be considered, however. Firstly, the study was conducted using a relatively small sample size of only six specimens. This may not be representative of the variability that can be observed in larger samples or over long periods. The results, therefore, need to be viewed with caution and may not be generalizable beyond the specific samples tested. Secondly, the study was carried out over a relatively short period of three years. The experiment does not account for the influence of other factors in the subsequent years. It would, therefore, be important to continue testing to account for other factors that may have an influence on the material performance, such as exposure to elements that cause wear and tear, and changes to the spec operation and production procedures.
In conclusion, the testing of carbon steel specimensâ€™ properties is an important step in identifying the best and most effective material for manufacturing different components. The experimental data collected in 1995 and 1998 demonstrates a variation in the properties of carbon steel specimens, with some specimens demonstrating higher or lower tensile strengths, elongation, hardness, and impact resistance. However, the variations observed may be attributed to a number of factors, including inconsistencies in manufacturing and inconsistencies in testing methods or equipment. In light of the findings of this study, it is important to continue testing carbon steel over a long period and with a larger sample size to fully understand the extent of variation and its causes. Ultimately, greater knowledge of the properties of carbon steels will aid in the manufacture of safe, efficient and cost-effective products.
