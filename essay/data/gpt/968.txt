The role of money in influencing American politics has continued to pose a threat to the democratic principles of this country. Money is power, and in American politics, it translates to control. Despite numerous attempts to streamline campaign finance regulations, the hold that money has on American politics is undeniable. Political candidates and parties rely heavily on fundraising to cover the high costs of running for office and running political campaigns. This reliance on money has far-reaching consequences, including limiting democracy, promoting corruption, and perpetuating unequal representation.
Firstly, the role of money in American politics limits democracy by making it impossible for all citizens to run for office. Running for any elected office requires extensive funding beyond what most citizens can afford, even if they possess an exceptional record of public service or the necessary leadership qualities. Therefore, big donors, corporations, and special interest groups have a more significant say in choosing who runs in elections, which impedes the democratic selection of politicians. This reality discourages the participation of individuals without sufficient financial resources in politics, thus precluding America from benefiting from a diverse pool of politicians that represent the country's diverse population.
Secondly, money in politics has resulted in corruption, with political donors using big donations to gain favor and influence elected officials. The influence of big money in American politics has promoted an obscured form of lobbying where big donors can outmaneuver the rules on political campaign donations and financing. Political candidates and parties rely on this funding and, in return, allow corporate donors to shape policies and laws in their favor, even if they are detrimental to the public good. In fact, research has shown that big donors get the most access to politicians. They gain more support from policymakers and concede to air their opinions. Consequently, this sustains the bidirectional relationship between politicians and the corporations or super PACs that bankroll them. This process is evident in America's “revolving door” policy, where politicians and bureaucrats hold positions in government agencies and private companies simultaneously.
Furthermore, the role of money in American politics has perpetuated unequal representation, with wealthy donors and corporations receiving more government attention than ordinary citizens who lack philanthropic financial abilities. This trend has seen many politicians focusing more on fundraising from wealthy donors rather than prioritizing their constituents' needs. Studies indicate that politicians who rely heavily on a handful of donors are more representative of these donors than the general population. This scenario disproportionally affects minorities, marginalized communities, and the poor. Therefore, it's financially possible for the United States to have an unequal voting process, where fewer poor and economically-disadvantaged minorities cannot exercise their democratic rights.
In conclusion, the role of money in American politics is a problem that hinders democratic principles, promotes corruption, and perpetuates unequal influence. With the rising cost of running political campaigns, the influence of wealthy donors and special interest groups ensures that only a particular class of people can afford to participate in democracy, making it less inclusive and less representative. The consequences of this are far-reaching and adversely affect everyone who lives in America. Therefore, there is a need for more financial regulation to curb this trend, mitigate the influence of cash in politics, and promote transparency to the public. Only then can we hope to create a genuinely inclusive political environment and achieve equity in our democracy. It's the duty of every citizen to hold elected officials accountable for creating and strengthening democracy in America.
