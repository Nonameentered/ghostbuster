Participating in presentations in a module that emphasizes free interpretation and soft skills development has been an essential aspect in my personal and team growth. It has contributed significantly to my communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills while also providing me with a platform to express my personal interpretation and creativity. In this essay, I will detail my experience in the module and how it has helped me improve my free interpretation and soft skills development. 
To start with, the module emphasized the importance of free interpretation in presentations. The idea was to encourage creativity and innovation in the presentation by allowing each participant to infuse their personality into their presentation. It was fascinating to me because it meant that presentations could go beyond the limits of a formal presentation to become an avenue of personal expression. I found the concept intriguing, particularly since other modules had mostly emphasized adhering to a particular structure while presenting information. 
With every presentation, I learned something new. I found that incorporating my own ideas gave me a sense of ownership of the presentation, and this, in turn, helped me become more confident when presenting. I learned that my approach to a topic could be just as valid as the next person's, and the audience appreciated varied perspectives. As I became more confident, I learned how to effectively communicate my ideas and collaborate with my colleagues. In that regard, the module was more than about improving our presentation skills. It was about developing our soft skills too. 
My experience in the module has been invaluable. Through group presentations, I learned how to collaborate with others more effectively. For instance, during a presentation that involved seven people, communication was key, and each person's input was essential. It was fascinating to me how the team came together to present a cohesive presentation. We all had our ideas, but we learned how to come up with a coherent presentation that incorporated our individual perspectives. 
Being in that team also taught me to be more receptive to other peopleâ€™s ideas and to consider varying viewpoints. Additionally, it created an avenue for personal growth, particularly in problem-solving. We faced different challenges in each presentation, such as missing slides, technical difficulties, and poor time management. However, we learned how to come up with solutions on the spot, how to delegate tasks, and how to reorganize quickly to present a polished presentation. 
Furthermore, being in this module has helped me become more relaxed and comfortable in front of an audience. In my early presentations, I was very nervous and found it difficult to articulate my ideas. But as I worked on different presentations, my confidence increased, and my ability to articulate my ideas improved as well. It felt liberating to be able to express my thoughts in front of others without fear of judgment. 
In conclusion, participating in presentations in a module that emphasizes free interpretation and soft skills development has been a phenomenal experience for me. I have learned how to collaborate effectively, communicate my ideas clearly, and address issues on the fly. As such, I intend to further improve my skills in these areas. I plan to continue honing my presentation skills, participate in more group projects, and take up more leadership roles to improve my team management skills. Additionally, I aim to keep learning new ways to express myself creatively to make each presentation unique. 
In summary, the module has been an essential aspect of my personal and team growth. It has allowed me to become more confident, articulate my ideas more effectively, and further develop my soft skills. With my newfound skills, I am better equipped to handle challenges, work in collaborative environments, and present my ideas coherently. Going forward, I am excited to continually grow and develop in these areas.
