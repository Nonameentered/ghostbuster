Bertolt Brecht’s play “The Threepenny Opera” and Fritz Lang’s film “M” both offer a critique of society’s treatment of crime and justice during the interwar period in Europe. Although each work tells a different story and employs different modes of storytelling, a comparison of the two works can reveal similarities and differences in how criminal spheres, criminal motivations, and the social and economic conditions of the time are represented.
In “The Threepenny Opera,” the criminal underworld is the focus of the play. The central character, Macheath “Mack the Knife” Peachum, is a notorious criminal who is pursued by the police. Alongside Macheath are other criminals who belong to a gang led by J.J. Peachum. The gangsters are portrayed as both dangerous and amusing, with their antics providing comic relief to the otherwise bleak story.
In “M,” the criminal world is represented by a serial killer who targets young girls. The film follows the police investigation into the murders and the search for the killer. Unlike in “The Threepenny Opera,” the criminals in “M” are portrayed as dangerous and destructive members of society. The killer, Hans Beckert, is shown as a sadistic and disturbed individual who must be stopped at all costs.
The differences in the portrayal of criminal spheres in the two works have a lot to do with the way they tell their stories. “The Threepenny Opera” is a musical comedy, with several humorous scenes featuring the gangsters. By contrast, “M” is a serious drama that focuses on the horror of the murderer’s actions. However, these differences reflect broader social attitudes towards the criminal underworld during this period. In the Weimar Republic, criminal activity was often portrayed in popular culture as an amusing and harmless diversion from the monotony of everyday life. However, as the rise of the Nazi party indicated, this was not a sustainable approach to crime and justice.
Criminal motivations are also portrayed differently in the two works. In “The Threepenny Opera,” Macheath’s crimes are driven by his desire for wealth and power. He is a charismatic character who uses his charm to manipulate those around him. In “M,” the killer’s motivations are more complex. He is shown as being driven by a compulsion to kill, which is often linked to his traumatic childhood. While Macheath is a criminal who operates within existing power structures, Beckert is a lone and dangerous individual, whose crimes are inexplicable.
Again, the portrayal of criminal motivations reflects broader social attitudes towards crime and justice. During the interwar period, the idea of the criminal as a rebellious anti-hero was popular among many writers and artists. However, the rise of fascist movements, such as the Nazis, necessitated that criminals be portrayed as evil and deserving of punishment. Thus, in “M,” the killer is shown as being diseased and deviant, rather than a revolutionary figure.
Underlying social and economic conditions also play a role in the portrayal of crime and justice in the two works. In “The Threepenny Opera,” poverty and desperation are shown as being central to the criminal underworld. The gangsters are portrayed as being forced into a life of crime due to their lack of opportunities. By contrast, in “M,” the social and economic conditions are less explicitly represented. The focus of the film is on the individual motivations of the killer, rather than the broader social context.
There are, however, similarities in the provision of extenuating circumstances for the crimes committed by both Macheath and Hans Beckert. In “The Threepenny Opera,” Macheath is ultimately pardoned for his crimes due to his status as a hero of the working class. The judges who try him are shown to be corrupt, and the play implies that Macheath’s pardon is due to bribery. Similarly, in “M,” the killer is shown to have a mental illness, which is used to explain his actions. In both cases, the criminals are shown to be products of their environment, rather than purely evil individuals.
The provision of extenuating circumstances in both works reflects broader debates about crime and justice during the interwar period. Many writers and intellectuals of the time were questioning the harsh punishments and draconian laws that had been introduced in the aftermath of World War I. The use of extenuating circumstances in “The Threepenny Opera” and “M” can be seen as a critique of these policies, and a call for a more humane and understanding approach to criminal justice.
In conclusion, while “The Threepenny Opera” and “M” offer different portrayals of crime and justice, they share similarities in their exploration of extenuating circumstances for criminal behavior. The differences in criminal spheres, criminal motivations, and social and economic conditions reflect broader debates and attitudes towards crime and justice during the interwar period. Both works offer insights into the social, cultural, and political changes that were taking place during this turbulent time in European history.
