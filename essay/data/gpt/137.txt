Throughout history, the world has witnessed many divergences among different civilizations such as the East and the West, each taking a distinct path to achieve modernity. In the case of China and Western Europe, their paths were drastically different, leading to a significant divergence between them. While Western Europe had progressed economically and technologically, China's development lagged behind, leading to an imbalance of power between the two regions. In this essay, I will explore the factors that led to this divergence and argue that it was not solely due to luck and good fortune but rather the connections formed between 1300 and 1800 played a significant role. 
Between the period of 1300 and 1800, the world was not as disconnected as it might seem. There were considerable connections and interactions between different civilizations, which had a significant impact on their development. Trade and commerce, as well as cultural exchange, were facilitated through the Silk Road, which stretched from China to Europe. This route allowed the exchange of goods, ideas, and technologies, leading to significant similarities between societies, particularly in their economies, state control, and religion. For instance, both Europe and China had highly centralized and bureaucratic systems, with a strong emphasis on the rule of law. They also had similar religious practices, with Christianity and Buddhism both emphasizing the importance of charity and morality.
However, despite these similarities, there were also significant differences that led to their divergent paths. First, the economies of Europe and China had developed differently. Europe's economy was characterized by capitalism, which allowed for more efficient production and exchange of goods and services, leading to a high level of economic growth. China's economy, on the other hand, was still largely based on a feudal system, which meant that inefficient production and agrarian-based economies were the norm. This resulted in a significant weakness in China's economic development.
Second, the difference in state control was another factor that contributed to the divergence between the two regions. While both Europe and China had centralized bureaucratic systems, the difference was in how each state recognized individual freedoms. In Europe, individual freedoms were valued, and individuals were given the autonomy to make decisions that impacted their lives and their society. In China, however, the state had a high degree of control over individuals, leading to a lack of personal autonomy. This factor contributed to the stunted creativity and innovation in China, which harmed its capacity for growth.
Third, religion played a significant role in both regions, but in fundamentally different ways. In Europe, the emergence of Protestantism helped to foster the creation of capitalism with its emphasis on individual freedoms, whereas, in China, religion did not play this role. Hence, religion led to the fostering of entrepreneurialism in Europe, while in China, it did not contribute to economic or technological progress.
Despite the differences that had emerged between the two regions, the period of archaic and early modern globalization saw certain areas of convergence. The exchange of ideas, technologies, and trade routes allowed for advancements in medicine, agriculture, and printing technology. As a result, convergence could be seen in these areas, even as divergence occurred in others.
However, the passing towards modernity marked by the Industrial Revolution and population growth was an essential factor that contributed to the divergence between East and West. The Industrial Revolution allowed for mass production and efficient manufacturing, which significantly contributed to the growth and advancement of Western Europe. At the same time, China's feudal system prevented it from keeping pace with the economic and technological changes unfolding around the world, thus hindering its potential for growth.
In conclusion, while there were significant similarities between Western Europe and China during the period of archaic and early modern globalization, a culmination of factors led to their divergence. The differences such as a capitalist economy, individual freedom and the role of religion played a critical role in the economic and technological superiority of Western Europe over China since the early 19th century. The period of globalization may have had areas of convergence, but ultimately it was the industrial revolution and population growth that propelled the West ahead of the East, leading to an imbalance of power that still persists to this day.
