Jules Verne's 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth' is a classic and adventurous novel filled with science and adventure. The novel has always been praised for its accurate depiction of scientific events and environments. However, it has also been criticized for several instances where the scientific accuracy of the novel comes under question. In this essay, we will explore the accuracy of science in 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth.'
One of the most intriguing elements of 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth' is the description of the underground world. Verne stated that the deeper into the earth, the hotter and hotter it gets, and the gravitational pull becomes weaker. The idea of a molten outer core and solid inner core of the earth was visionary and still holds accurate today. Verne's description of the Ashen Plains of Iceland, with its volcanoes and hot springs, was accurate in depicting how volcanic activity creates geothermal energy.
However, several of the novel's scientific concepts are questionable. For instance, the novel's central concept that there is a passageway to the centre of the earth is scientifically unfounded. The novel advocates the theory of a hollow earth, which is improbable. The heat and pressure inside the earth's mantle would render tunnels impossible. Moreover, the amount of interstellar radiation and heat generated in the earth's core would make conditions uninhabitable. Even if there were underground passages, the heat and environmental factors would make survival impossible.
Another aspect that comes under question is the description of the prehistoric animals encountered by the explorers. In the story, the characters come across dinosaurs, and Verne's description of them was accurate in depicting anatomical features. However, the idea of prehistoric animals becoming trapped beneath the earth's surface seems far-fetched. In reality, the mass extinction of the dinosaurs occurred around 65 million years ago, long before humans evolved, and even before the formation of modern mountain ranges and valleys. Therefore, seeing prehistoric creatures seemingly alive in the present time is not scientifically logical.
Furthermore, the novel's description of materials encountered in the centre of the earth is questionable. In the story, there is mention of the existence of diamonds. However, the process of diamond formation is much more complex and takes millions of years. The intense heat and pressure required to form diamonds are not necessarily present in the earth's core. Therefore, the novel's depiction of diamonds is unrealistic.
Despite its scientific inaccuracies, 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth' also touches on the concept of exploration and scientific discovery. The book illustrates the importance of curiosity and willingness to explore. The main characters in the story, Axel and Lidenbrock, have a passion for exploration and scientific discovery, which we can admire. In a way, the novel's message is to encourage people to look at the world from a different perspective, even if it means looking beneath the surface, as it were.
To conclude, 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth' provides a compelling and captivating story, with an accurate description of some scientific ideas, but also portraying several concepts that don't stand up to modern science. The novel captures the spirit of scientific discovery and exploration but blurs the line between science fiction and reality. Overall, despite its inaccuracies, Jules Verne's 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth' remains a classic and an excellent example of the power of human imagination to push the boundaries of science.
