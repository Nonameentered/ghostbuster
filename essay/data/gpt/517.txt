Felicity and Amy have potentially committed a number of legal offenses based on the chain of events described. These include theft, robbery, attempted theft, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In this essay, we will examine each offense and discuss the legal elements that must be proven in order to hold Felicity and Amy liable. We will also explore some criticisms of current English law regarding these offenses.
Theft
Theft is defined as the dishonest appropriation of property belonging to another with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it. In this instance, Felicity and Amy may have committed theft twice. First, they took the wallet from the man's pocket without his consent. Second, they took the jewelry from the store without paying for it.
In order to prove theft, the prosecution must establish two key elements. First, they must show that the property was taken without the owner's consent. In this case, the man did not give Felicity and Amy permission to take his wallet, and the store did not give them permission to take the jewelry. Second, they must show that the defendants intended to permanently deprive the owner of the property. Here, it is likely that Felicity and Amy intended to keep the items for themselves, and therefore intended to permanently deprive the owners of their property.
Robbery
Robbery is a more serious offense than theft, as it involves the use or threat of force. Robbery is defined as the unlawful taking of property belonging to another, with the intention of permanently depriving the owner of it, accompanied by the use or threat of force. In this case, Felicity and Amy may have committed robbery against the man.
To prove robbery, the prosecution must establish theft (as discussed above) and two further elements. First, they must show that the defendant used force or threatened to use force to take the property. Here, Felicity and Amy grabbed the man's arm and pushed him, which could be considered force. Second, they must show that the force or threat of force was used in order to take the property. This means that without the use or threat of force, the defendants would not have been able to take the man's wallet.
Attempted Theft
Attempted theft occurs when the thief intends to steal property but is prevented from doing so, usually by the intervention of someone else. In this case, Felicity and Amy attempted to steal the jewelry from the store but were prevented from doing so by the security guard.
In order to prove attempted theft, the prosecution must establish that the defendant intended to steal the property. It must also be shown that the defendant took some step towards carrying out the theft, such as picking up the item or moving towards the exit, and that their efforts were interrupted. Here, Felicity and Amy picked up the jewelry and were moving towards the exit before being stopped by the security guard.
Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm
Assault is defined as intentionally or recklessly causing another person to fear immediate unlawful violence. Actual bodily harm (ABH) refers to injuries that are more than trifling, such as bruises, scratches, or broken bones. In this case, Felicity and Amy may have committed assault occasioning actual bodily harm against the man.
To prove this offense, the prosecution must establish three key elements. First, they must show that the defendant committed an assault. Here, it is argued that Felicity and Amy committed the assault by grabbing the man's arm and pushing him. Second, they must show that the victim suffered actual bodily harm. The man suffered bruises and scratches, which could be considered actual bodily harm. Finally, they must show that the defendant intended or was reckless as to causing the harm. Here, Felicity and Amy may have intended to push the man in order to distract him while they stole his wallet.
Criticisms of Current English Law
While the offenses discussed above are all criminal offenses in England, there are some criticisms of the current law surrounding them. One of the main criticisms is that the law is too complex and difficult for the average person to understand. This can lead to confusion and frustration, especially for those who are accused of a crime. The complexity of the law also makes it more difficult for the criminal justice system to administer justice fairly.
Another criticism of English law is that the penalties imposed for certain offenses are too severe. This can lead to an overcrowding of prisons and a strain on the criminal justice system as a whole. Some argue that more lenient, non-custodial sentences should be imposed for non-violent offenses in order to reduce the burden on the system and promote rehabilitation rather than punishment.
Additionally, there is criticism that current English law is too focused on punishment rather than prevention. Many believe that more resources should be dedicated to preventing crime in the first place, rather than punishing those who commit it. This could involve investment in education, job training, and other social services that could reduce poverty and other factors that contribute to criminal behavior.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Felicity and Amy have potentially committed a number of legal offenses based on the chain of events described. These include theft, robbery, attempted theft, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Each of these offenses has specific legal elements that must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt in order to hold the defendants liable. While English law is often criticized for being too complex and focused on punishment rather than prevention, it remains an important tool for promoting justice and maintaining order in society.
