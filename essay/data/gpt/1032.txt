Thomas Hobbes and John Locke were both influential seventeenth-century English philosophers who deeply impacted political theory. While both Hobbes and Locke agree that political power must reside somewhere in society, they differ widely on issues such as the role of fear in government, limitations on political power, and the justification of an absolute sovereign. This essay will compare and contrast the arguments of Hobbes and Locke on the necessity of an absolute sovereign, evaluate Hobbes' argument for such a ruler, and consider alternative views.
Hobbes, in his most famous book Leviathan, argues for an absolute sovereign as the only means to avoid the “state of nature.” For Hobbes, the state of nature is a state of conflict where life is “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” He believes that human beings are naturally self-interested and in a state of constant war against each other in the absence of an absolute ruler. Hobbes believes that the only way to escape this intolerable state of nature is to transfer our individual rights and freedoms to an all-powerful sovereign who will ensure peace and security for the common good.
Hobbes justifies the sovereignty of the state by stating that without the sovereign, life would be unbearable. He argues that people are naturally selfish and not inclined to cooperate with each other if it doesn’t serve their interests. In Hobbes' view, a governing body would be essential to creating a social structure in which people could coexist peacefully. He believes that a sovereign ensures the security of individuals, along with their property and possessions, which would otherwise be at risk in a state of anarchy. This is because the sovereign can enforce laws that would protect everyone, which prevents individuals from turning on each other.
Hobbes also identifies fear as an important factor in securing a stable society. He posits that fear of punishment and death makes people comply with laws set by the sovereign. For Hobbes, fear is a necessary tool in order to keep citizens in line and secure their compliance. Without punishment, people would not have an incentive to obey laws or fear the consequences of disobeying them.
Locke takes a different approach to political power. He believes that individuals have natural God-given rights, and government should exist to protect and enforce these rights. He believes in a governmental system that is representative of the people and therefore limited in its powers. Locke views political power as contractual between the government and its citizens. Government must uphold its end of the agreement by upholding individual rights and enforcing laws to protect these rights. If government does not fulfill its obligations, then citizens have a right to remove it and form a new one that better protects their individual rights.
Locke also opposes the use of fear as a means of control. Unlike Hobbes, who sees fear as a necessary tool to incentivize people to obey laws and work towards the common good, Locke believes that coercion undermines the legitimacy of government. Instead, he believes that the government's legitimacy rests on the consent of the governed. For Locke, the role of the government is to empower, not to control its citizens.
Both Hobbes and Locke see the state of nature as a starting point for their debate on political philosophy. They both believe that in the state of nature, individuals do not have natural rights, and their lives are subject to the whims of the stronger parties. However, Hobbes suggests that the state of nature is a state of chaos and perpetual war, where without an absolute sovereign ruling over it, men will suffer. For Locke, the state of nature is a state of perfect freedom and equality, but also one of great insecurity.
Hobbes’ argument that an absolute sovereign guarantees stability and peace outlines a social contract between subjects and leaders in which citizens give up certain rights in exchange for the sovereign’s protection and the rule of law. This agreement results in the transfer of power from individuals to the state to establish a system that is structured around security, justice, and peace. Hence, according to Hobbes, it is extremely important that the sovereign is absolute and possesses all the necessary tools to ensure security, peace and justice since that is what the social contract has entrusted in him.
Hobbes' argument for an absolute sovereign, however, is not without its flaws. His view on the state of nature overlooks the potential for individuals to voluntarily come together and form a collective order, as well as the potential for individual self-restraint and cooperation. Hobbes’ emphasis on fear and coercion also fails to take into account the possibility that laws and norms may emerge organically from within civil society. Moreover, since the sovereign has ultimate power, there are concerns about the potential for abuse by the ruling authoritarian regime.
In contrast, Locke's approach promotes the idea of a limited government with the purpose of protecting property rights and ensuring the rule of law. According to Locke, the government must represent the consent of the governed. In this view, the power of the government depends on its citizens’ belief that it acts in their best interest and protects their rights. Under Locke’s view, sovereignty exists in the people themselves, and the government must exist to protect and defend their rights.
Furthermore, Locke’s position is more democratic and embraces the ideas of human liberty and equality. Locke is less concerned with the rule of law than with the protection of individuals’ natural rights. According to Locke, people are both morally and legally entitled to equality in the state of nature. This, in turn, shapes Locke’s views on government, with the government existing as a factor in shaping society, granting individuals the security of liberty and property, but ultimately being accountable to the critiques of the people.
In conclusion, Hobbes and Locke both offer valuable and different insights into the nature of political power and the role of the state in society. While Hobbes argues for an absolute sovereign, relying heavily upon fear and coercion to maintain peace, Locke sees government as limited and serving the purpose of protecting individual rights, promoting equality and liberty. Hobbes and Locke's contrasting views on the role of fear in political power and sovereignty, most importantly, offer important and contrasting ideas surrounding the nature of human beings. Hobbes emphasizes that it is part of our natural selves to be selfish and that this must be controlled by force, while Locke optimistically contemplates humanity as altogether capable of freedom, cooperation, and morality without the need for coercion.
