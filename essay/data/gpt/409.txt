The nineteenth century witnessed a significant shift in the economic and social landscape of the western world. Amidst the industrial revolution, the emergence of new forms of production, and unprecedented urbanization, the working classes found themselves at the mercy of capitalist exploiters. These were oftentimes the same individuals who owned the means of production and profited off of the labor of others. As a result, artisans and proletarian workers alike fought for their rights, culminating in militant action, strikes, and confrontations with the state. However, it is remarkable that it took longer for the proletarian workers to mobilize than it did for artisans. This essay explores factors that contributed to artisan mobilization and the lag in proletarian worker mobilization in the nineteenth century.
Firstly, artisans were in a comparatively better position than their proletarian counterparts in the nineteenth century. This stems from the fact that their work was skilled and specialized. Consequently, artisans could demand higher wages and had a greater degree of autonomy over their labor. In contrast, proletarian workers often worked in mass production factories, performing repetitive, unskilled manual labor. This rendered them easily replaceable and saw them subjected to harsher working conditions. In addition, the increased competition in the labor market meant that proletarian workers were more disposable than artisans. As a result, artisans had relatively more leverage in negotiating with their employers and were more likely to push for their rights.
Secondly, artisans were part of a long-standing craft tradition that fostered a sense of community, solidarity, and mutual support. They had established forms of social organization that were based on the guild system, a medieval institution that brought together craftsmen for mutual protection and support. In this system, apprenticeships created a hierarchical social order, bound by mutual obligations. As a result, artisans enjoyed a sense of collectivity and a shared identity that gave them the confidence to take collective action against their employers. In contrast, proletarian workers were often drawn from diverse backgrounds and ethnicities, lacking a unifying identity. This made it harder for workers in larger factories to form coherent trade unions, which could mobilize collective action.
Thirdly, the spread of radical ideas and political ideologies provided artisans with intellectual resources to challenge their exploitation and oppression. The radical ideas of socialism, anarchism, and trade unionism had been brewing since the late eighteenth century and crystallized in the writings of thinkers like Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. These intellectuals called for a revolution that would overthrow the capitalist mode of production and replace it with one that was based on communal ownership and distribution of resources. These ideas resonated with artisans who experienced the daily brutality of capitalism and inspired them to take militant action. In contrast, prolétariat workers, who were often less educated, had a hard time grasping the complexities of these radical ideas. This made it hard for them to build alliances with intellectuals, which could have facilitated their mobilization.
Fourthly, artisans were often employed in small-scale production, which made it easier for them to organize. Small workshops that employed a few laborers allowed for close-knit communities, where collective mobilization was easier to achieve. In addition, since production was decentralized in these settings, artisans were not restricted to a single workplace or employer. This gave them more bargaining power and allowed them to move around looking for better wages and working conditions. In contrast, proletarian workers often worked in large factories, where individuality was discouraged, and where they were often confined to a single employer. This made organizing more difficult since it could be easily suppressed with callous tactics such as dismissal, blacklisting, or repression.
Finally, the state response to worker mobilization played a crucial role in the relative lag in proletarian workers' militant action. In the early nineteenth century, many European states made it illegal for workers to form trade unions or go on strikes. This was done out of fear of revolutionary action, which could potentially threaten bourgeois rule. As a result, artisans were less likely to face state repression since their mobilization could be seen as a sign of civic engagement rather than a political statement. In contrast, proletarian workers were seen as a class threat to the existing social order. This made it easier for employers to use state power to suppress their actions. As a result, proletarian workers had to find alternative means of organizing, such as building political parties, to mobilize their constituents.
In conclusion, the reason why artisans were more likely to participate in militant action during the nineteenth century, in comparison to proletarian workers, can be attributed to a combination of factors. These include the privileged position artisans held vis-à-vis proletarian workers, the sense of community and solidarity created by artisanal guilds, the proliferation of radical ideas, the decentralized nature of artisanal work, and the state response to worker mobilization. While these factors undoubtedly explain why artisanal mobilization was quicker, it is important to remember that proletarian worker mobilization did eventually take place, leading to significant changes in the political, social and economic landscape of the western world.
