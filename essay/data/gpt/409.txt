The European Council is the institution responsible for setting the political agenda of the European Union. Made up of the Heads of State or Government of the EU member states, its role is to provide strategic direction and guidance for the Union. The Council meets at least twice a year and can hold additional meetings when necessary. Its decisions impact Community law through the adoption of regulations and directives which become binding upon all member states.
The varying views of the European Council reflect the tensions and complexities of the EU's political landscape. Critics argue that the Council represents an undemocratic concentration of power, with member states dominating decision-making to the detriment of smaller countries. Others view it as an essential instrument of European governance, providing a forum for consensus-building and cooperation on key issues such as climate change and migration.
The ratification of the Constitutional Treaty could potentially alter our understanding of the European Council's role within the hierarchy of the EU. The Treaty would give the Council greater powers, including the ability to appoint a President of the Union and a Foreign Affairs Minister. This would represent a significant institutional shift towards a more centralized, federal model of governance, with the Council at the forefront of decision-making.
In conclusion, the European Council plays a vital role in shaping the direction of the European Union. Its decisions impact Community law and have far-reaching consequences for all member states. Despite criticism of its concentration of power and influence, the Council remains an essential instrument of European governance. The ratification of the Constitutional Treaty could potentially bring about significant changes to the EU's institutional structure, and alter the Council's position within the hierarchy.
