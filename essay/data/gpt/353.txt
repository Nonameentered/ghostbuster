Maternal effect genes are those whose products are synthesized by the mother and deposited into the egg during oogenesis. These maternal factors are critical to early embryonic development, as they guide and organize the earliest stages of development before the onset of zygotic gene expression. The effects of maternal effect genes are essential for the proper formation of the embryo and remain crucial until the end of gastrulation when the embryo begins transcription of its own genes. The importance of this process is reflected in the fact that disruptions to this process can lead to developmental defects. In this essay, we will discuss the role of maternal effect genes in early development, including their effect on cell fate determination, the establishment of polarity during the first cell cycle, and their role in establishing asymmetry in the germline and early embryo. 
Maternal effect genes play a significant role in cell fate determination during the early stages of embryonic development. Their effect is particularly important in the formation of the body axis and the formation of different tissues and organs. Cell fate decisions are made during the first cell division, which occurs after fertilization. The first blastomere divides into two cells, the anterior cell (AB) and posterior cell (P1). Each of these cells carries differentially distributed maternal factors. The molecular machinery responsible for the segregation of these factors is complex, but it involves specific protein complexes such as PAR proteins (PAR-1, PAR-2, and PAR-3) and the cytoskeleton. 
The PAR proteins are an essential part of the machinery that establishes polarity in the early embryo. They operate by regulating the positioning of the mitotic spindle and ensuring that the resulting daughter cells have different developmental potential. PAR-3 localizes to the anterior of the embryo, while PAR-1 localizes to the posterior. PAR-2 is associated with the central spindle and the cortex. Their distribution generates an asymmetry that determines the future anterior-posterior axis. This spatial organization is crucial to the proper differentiation and development of the embryo. 
Mutations in maternal effect genes can have profound effects on cell fate determination during embryonic development. For example, the mutation of the Oskar gene in fruit flies leads to the loss of germ cells in the developing embryo. Similarly, mutations in the Nodal gene in mice prevent the proper formation of the left-right axis in early development. The disruption of this axis can lead to severe developmental problems, such as reversed internal organs or misplacement of the heart. 
In addition to regulating cell fate, maternal effect genes also play a significant role in transcriptional regulation. In the early embryo, the first daughter cells (AB and P1) have different gene expression patterns, leading to the development of different cell types. These patterns are established and maintained by maternal gene products. The EMS blastomere is a particularly interesting example of cell fate determination driven by maternal effect genes. The EMS blastomere exists in the early embryo and gives rise to several different cell types, including neurons, muscle cells, and intestinal cells. The determinant molecule, SKN-1, is expressed only in the EMS blastomere and plays a crucial role in regulating transcription and controlling cell fate. 
Moreover, EMS cell fate determination is also regulated by the transcription factor MEX-1, which is expressed in the P2 daughter cell. MEX-1 expression is necessary for specifying a P2 cell fate. This requirement is due to MEX-1's ability to interfere with SKN-1 activity, preventing the ectopic activation of genes responsible for EMS cell fate. Therefore, the presence of SKN-1 is sufficient for EMS cell fate determination when MEX-1 is absent. 
PIE-1 is a maternal gene product that plays a significant role in establishing asymmetry in the germline and early embryo. In C. Elegans, PIE-1 is localized to the posterior pole of the zygote and migrates to the anterior side of the blastomeres during division while excluding from the opposite side. Its concentration gradient resulting from differential inheritance of PIE-1 has remained apparent throughout four successive cell division. Later PIE-1 facilitates the germline differentiation by protecting its future germline from being exposed to somatic signals. 
Maternal gene products complement and provide the necessary machinery for the zygote to proceed to full development without any effect on the embryonic genome. The amount and distribution of maternal factors, such as RNA and proteins, determine the formation of different cell lineages, as well as the establishment of asymmetry and polarity in the early embryo. The role of maternal effect genes in embryonic development is essential and highly regulated. 
In conclusion, maternal effect genes play crucial roles during embryonic development, regulating cell fate determination, transcriptional regulation, and polarity. The proteins produced by these genes determine the proper axis formation and the differentiation of different cell types. Their disruption can lead to severe developmental defects, highlighting the importance of proper human embryonic development. Additionally, the correct establishment of asymmetry in the germline and early embryo is essential for correct development. Research on maternal effect genes and their function during embryonic development is crucial to understanding the earliest stages of human development and how disruptions lead to developmental defects.
