During the Victorian era in England, women were expected to abide by strict social norms and were constantly scrutinized for any deviance from these norms. Mental illness, especially in women, was often stigmatized and associated with deviant behavior. Additionally, social class played a crucial role in shaping women's experiences of mental illness. This essay aims to explore the ways in which social class affected women's experiences of madness during the Victorian era in England.
Firstly, it is essential to understand the social norms and expectations that women were expected to fit into during the Victorian era. The "Angel in the House" was a prevalent concept, which demanded that women embody qualities such as modesty, piety, and domesticity. Women were expected to fulfill their roles as wives and mothers, and their main responsibilities were to maintain the household, take care of their children, and fulfill their husband's needs. Any behavior that deviated from these norms was seen as social deviance and could lead to labeling as insane.
Social class also determined the availability and quality of treatment for women who experienced mental illness. Middle and upper-class women had access to better resources, such as sanatoriums or private hospitals, often run and staffed by trained professionals. These institutions provided care, treatment, and confinement for women, with the goal of stabilizing their mental health and returning them to society. However, this only applied to women who had sufficient financial means and could afford these facilities.
On the other hand, working-class women had very limited options for treatment, and often faced severe stigmatization. Working-class women lived in extreme poverty and often in overcrowded conditions with little access to basic healthcare, let alone mental healthcare. Consequently, when these women experienced any form of mental illness, they were often stigmatized and ostracized by their communities, with no meaningful access to professional care. This social stigma led to a lack of understanding of mental illness, and trivialization of mental health problems in working-class communities.
The condition of asylums, which were the primary institutions for the treatment of mental illness, also varied according to social class. Wealthy patients had access to private asylums, which provided an environment that resembled a domestic space, and offered superior comfort and treatment. Private asylums were mostly unregulated, and physicians and asylum keepers had the freedom to conduct any treatments or procedures on their patients, which they deemed fit, including physical restraint, seclusion, and electroshock therapy.
However, for the working-class women, the options were limited to public asylums, which were overcrowded, with several patients crammed into a single room. Patients were mistreated, often left in unhygienic conditions, and subjected to brutal and inhumane treatments. The infamous Bethlem Hospital, for example, commonly known as Bedlam, depicted in literature and popular culture of the time, was notorious for its appalling living conditions. Patients were chained to walls, beaten, and subjected to brutal treatments such as cold water baths, bloodletting, and prolonged periods of solitary confinement.
Another factor contributing to social class-based differences in women's experiences of madness was the changing attitudes toward mental illness. The Victorian era saw a rapid shift in the perception of mental illness, from a moral failing, to a medical condition. With the development of psychiatry and the introduction of new treatments, mental illness started to be viewed as an aspect of illness that required medical treatment, something that could be cured or managed.
However, for women, the changing attitudes towards mental illness were still clouded with societal stigma, especially for working-class women. Mental illness was seen as a moral failing, and a reflection of the woman's character, rather than a medical condition. Stigma, therefore stunted the progress of effective medical treatments for women, often resulting in inadequate or detrimental treatment, which perpetuated the problem and worsened their condition.
The medical treatments available for women in asylums also differed according to social class. Women from the working-class were often experimented on with new treatments, which may sometimes be untested and left them in more distress. Some institutions such as Bethlem even served as venues for medical experiments on patients, conducted with little or no explicit consent. These patients were often administered drugs and subjected to electroshock therapy, which led to significant changes in behaviour, and symptom management but could also lead to severe side effects and long-term physical damage.
In contrast, women from wealthier families had access to alternative treatments such as hydrotherapy, and massages, which were seen as more humane, and less invasive. These treatments had little scientific evidence of effectiveness, but their gentleness and appeal to the upper class made them the preferred choice in alternative asylums and hospitals.
Finally, social class also played a significant role in determining the diagnosis of mental illness in women. The working-class women were more prone to being diagnosed with madness due to their perceived moral deviance or 'unsound' behaviour, as compared to women from the upper and middle classes. The diagnosis and treatment of madness were influenced by the cultural perceptions of femininity and the gender roles prescribed by society. Women who did not fit the prescribed norms of conduct for their social class were classified as deviant, regardless of whether their behaviour was actually indicative of a medical condition.
In conclusion, social class played a significant role in shaping women's experiences of madness during the Victorian era in England. The societal pressure to conform to rigid norms and the stigma surrounding mental illness often made women's experiences of madness profoundly negative. Additionally, the limited options for accessible and quality care for working-class women, combined with the brutal and inhumane conditions in public asylums, made their experiences of madness more severe and protracted. Although much has changed since the Victorian era, including the development of medical therapies, it is essential to bear in mind that social class still influences the availability and quality of care for women dealing with mental illness, especially with regards to accessibility and affordability. As we strive towards ending the stigma surrounding mental health, it is essential to take into account the existing social class-based inequalities in diagnosis, treatment, and care of women experiencing madness or any other mental illness.
