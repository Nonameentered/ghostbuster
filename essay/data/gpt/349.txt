The European Council is regarded as the highest decision-making body in the European Union, composed of the heads of state or government of the member states. The European Council shapes the overall direction and priorities of the EU, and plays a significant role in the EU's decision-making process. The European Council's role in Community decision-making and hierarchy over the Community Institutions are often debated among EU scholars and policymakers. The limitations of the statement, "The European Council does not play a formal role in the Community decision-making and does not constitute an institution hierarchically superior to the Community Institutions," can be analyzed through relevant Community law and examples of the EU decision-making process. The implications of the European Council's role in Community decision-making and the need for reform will be examined further in this essay.
The EU decision-making process involves various institutions, including the European Council, European Commission, European Parliament, Council of the European Union, and the European Court of Justice. Each institution has its unique responsibilities and functions within the EU. The Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provide the legal framework for the EU institutions' powers and procedures. While the European Council is not explicitly mentioned as an EU institution in the Treaties, it is a central part of the EU's decision-making process.
The European Council's primary role is to provide the EU with political direction and guidance. The European Council meets at least twice a year, and its meetings are often associated with significant policy decisions taken by the EU. The European Council is responsible for setting the overall priorities and objectives of the EU, including economic, social, and foreign policy issues. The European Council determines the EU's strategic goals and policies, which are then implemented by the other EU institutions. In this way, the European Council plays a crucial role in the EU's policy-making process.
While the European Council does not have legislative functions, its decisions have a significant impact on the Union's legislative process. The European Council can give mandates to the Council of the European Union, which represents the member states' governments, to adopt specific legislative measures. The European Council also has the authority to request that the European Commission propose legislation, and it can influence the Commission's policy agenda. Therefore, the European Council does play a significant role in the EU's legislative process, and its decisions can shape the EU's policy outcomes.
In terms of its hierarchy over the other EU institutions, the European Council is not officially considered an EU institution. However, it is widely regarded as the apex of the EU's decision-making process. The European Council's decisions are not legally binding, but they do carry significant political weight and are often implemented through other EU institutions. The European Council's decisions can also serve as guidelines for the EU institutions' policy-making and interpretation of EU law. Therefore, the European Council's role in the EU decision-making process cannot be underestimated.
The limitations of the statement, "The European Council does not play a formal role in the Community decision-making and does not constitute an institution hierarchically superior to the Community Institutions," can be demonstrated through examples of the EU's decision-making process. For instance, one example is the adoption of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. The Lisbon Treaty significantly increased the European Parliament's powers by making it a co-legislator with the Council in most policy areas. However, the Lisbon Treaty also added new competences to the European Council, such as those related to economic governance and foreign policy. The Lisbon Treaty also established the position of the President of the European Council, who chairs the European Council meetings and represents the EU at the international level. These changes demonstrate the European Council's formal role in the EU decision-making process and its position as a critical player in the EU's hierarchy.
Another example is the response of the EU to the COVID-19 pandemic. The European Council played a vital role in the EU's economic recovery plan, known as Next Generation EU. The European Council negotiated the recovery plan's size, distribution, and conditions, highlighting its influence in shaping the EU's economic policy. The European Council's role in this process demonstrates its formal role in the EU's decision-making process and highlights its hierarchy over the other EU institutions.
The implications of the European Council's role in Community decision-making are significant. The European Council's prioritization of political goals can lead to an imbalance in the EU's policy outcomes. The European Council's focus on political considerations can sometimes conflict with technical and legal requirements, leading to suboptimal policy outcomes. The European Council's power can also lead to disagreements and delays in the EU's decision-making process, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of coordination between institutions.
The need for reform in the European Council's role in Community decision-making is crucial in addressing the EU's challenges. One proposal is to increase the European Parliament's role in the EU's decision-making process by making it a co-legislator in all policy areas. This proposal would balance the European Council's political considerations with technical and legal requirements, leading to better policy outcomes. Another reform proposal is to increase the transparency and accountability of the European Council's decision-making process. This proposal would increase public trust in the EU's decision-making process and ensure that the European Council's decisions are in the EU citizens' best interest.
In conclusion, the European Council plays a formal role in the EU's decision-making process and is hierarchically superior to the other EU institutions. The European Council's role in the EU's policy-making process cannot be underestimated, as it provides political direction and guidance to the other EU institutions. The European Council's prioritization of political goals can lead to an imbalance that needs to be addressed through reforms. The need for reform in the European Council's role in Community decision-making is crucial for the EU to address its challenges efficiently. EU policymakers need to balance the European Council's political considerations with technical and legal requirements to ensure optimal policy outcomes. By increasing transparency and accountability in the European Council's decision-making process, policymakers can increase public trust in the EU's decision-making process and ensure the EU's decisions are in the best interest of EU citizens.
