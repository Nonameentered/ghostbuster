The objective of the experiment to determine the reducing sugar content of jam is to quantify the amount of sugar that can be reduced through the process of chemical reduction. The experiment is performed to evaluate the quality of the jam and to determine the shelf life of the product.
To measure the reducing sugar content of the jam, the materials required include a few grams of jam, a 50ml volumetric flask, a burette, Fehling’s solution A and B, and a hot water bath. In the first step, a few grams of jam are dissolved in distilled water and the solution is made up to the 50ml mark in the volumetric flask.
After the solution is prepared, 25ml of the solution is taken in a conical flask and then heated in a hot water bath. This step is important for the hydrolysis of the sugar present in the jam. After heating the solution, it is cooled down, and an equal volume of Fehling’s solution A and B is added. The mixture is then shaken well and is again heated in a water bath.
When the reducing sugar content of the jam is present, it reduces the Fehling’s solution, which results in the formation of a brick-red precipitate. By measuring the amount of precipitate formed, the reducing sugar content of the jam can be determined.
In conclusion, the reducing sugar content of jam can be measured through the process of chemical reduction. This experiment is vital to examine the quality and shelf life of the product, and the materials and procedures utilized play a crucial role in obtaining accurate results.
