Realism as a theoretical approach to international relations is rooted in the belief that states and international actors operate in a self-help system, pursuing their own interests in the absence of a central authority. Realists argue that international politics is inherently characterized by conflict and competition, with states vying for power and security in a world of limited resources. As a result, realist scholars maintain that a country's foreign policy should be oriented towards ensuring its own security and survival above all else.
Realism emerged as a popular approach to international relations in the aftermath of World War I, as European powers struggled to rebuild their shattered economies and redraw the international order. The Treaty of Versailles, signed in 1919, punished Germany severely for its role in the war, leading to resentment and a sense of injustice that would later contribute to the rise of Hitler and the outbreak of World War II. Realists argue that the Treaty of Versailles was flawed precisely because it failed to account for the power dynamics and security concerns that drove international relations at the time.
However, the success of realism was not immediate, as other theoretical approaches to international relations, such as idealism and constructivism, gained popularity in the interwar period. Idealism posits that states should work towards cooperation and the creation of an international order based on shared values and principles, while constructivism maintains that social norms and ideas shape international relations and that international actors can work towards changing these norms and promoting cooperation.
Nonetheless, realism maintained its relevance in the post-World War I period due to its adaptability and its ability to accurately reflect the power dynamics and security concerns that drove international relations during this time. Realism gained renewed attention during the Cold War, as scholars and policymakers attempted to understand the dynamics of the bipolar world order created by the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union.
The Cold War era was marked by a series of proxy wars, arms races, and nuclear brinkmanship, all of which were driven by the realist belief that states seek power and security as a means of survival. Realists argue that the balance of power between states is key to maintaining stability in the international system, and this was a central concern during the Cold War. Scholars and policymakers focused on the balance of power between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the potential for a catastrophic nuclear war if one side gained too much power.
Realism also maintained its relevance in the post-Cold War era, as scholars and policymakers attempted to navigate the transition to a unipolar world order dominated by the United States. Realists argue that the absence of a balance of power in the international system can lead to instability and conflict, and this was a central concern during the post-Cold War era.
Realist scholars and policymakers argued that the United States should work towards maintaining its hegemonic status in order to ensure stability and security in the international system. Realism also provided a framework for understanding the rise of new powers, such as China, and the potential for conflict and competition as these powers sought to assert themselves in the international system.
The adaptability of realism has allowed it to maintain its relevance in the current political climate, characterized by increasing geopolitical tensions, rising nationalism, and a shifting global power dynamic. Realists argue that these trends are a reflection of the fundamental dynamics of international relations, as states seek power and security in a world of limited resources.
Realism provides a valuable framework for understanding the motivations and behavior of states in the international system, and can be applied to a range of current issues, such as the conflict in Syria, the sanctions imposed on Russia, and the trade tensions between the United States and China.
In conclusion, the success of realism as an approach to international relations can be attributed to its ability to accurately reflect the power dynamics and security concerns that drive international relations, its adaptability to changing political climates, and its relevance to a range of current issues in international politics. While other theoretical approaches to international relations, such as idealism and constructivism, have gained popularity at different times in history, realism has maintained its relevance and influence from post World War I to present day. As such, it is likely to remain a key approach to understanding and managing international relations in the years to come.
