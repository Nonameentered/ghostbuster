The Ancient Egyptians have been revered for their advancements in various fields including medicine, mathematics, astronomy, and architecture; however, they are also known for their extensive use of magic. Magic played an integral role in various aspects of Ancient Egyptian life including State Magic, Funerary Magic, and Popular Magic. The use of magic in Ancient Egypt has kept people wondering about the ethical values that underpinned these practices. This essay seeks to explore the ethical values that were held by the Ancient Egyptians regarding the use of magic. Additionally, it will compare these ethical values to the magical techniques employed in State Magic, Funerary Magic, and Popular Magic.
Magic in Ancient Egypt was deeply connected to the idea of Ma'at, a concept that represented balance, truth, and justice. The Ancient Egyptians believed that a person's actions should be in line with Ma'at, and any action that went against it was considered morally wrong. Ma'at was one of the fundamental ethical values of the Ancient Egyptians, and it was evident in how they practiced magic. The use of magic was considered ethical as long as it was used to maintain balance and harmony in the world.
Another significant concept in Ancient Egyptian magic was Heka. Heka was the divine force that was used to create the universe, and it referred to the power of the spoken word. Heka was used in magic to invoke the gods and goddesses to help people achieve their desires. The use of Heka was considered ethical as long as it was used for the greater good and in line with Ma'at.
The techniques employed in State Magic were used for the benefit of the Pharaoh and the government. State Magic was aimed at maintaining the balance and stability of the kingdom. One of the ethical values that were held in State Magic was the idea of using magic to protect the kingdom from external threats. This was done by invoking the gods and goddesses to protect the borders of the kingdom and to prevent any external invasion.
State Magic also involved using magic to maintain the health and well-being of the Pharaoh. The Pharaoh was considered to be divine, and his health was a direct reflection of the health of the kingdom. Therefore, it was essential to ensure that the Pharaoh was healthy at all times. Magic was used to heal the Pharaoh in times of illness, and it was considered ethical as long as it was done in line with Ma'at.
Funerary Magic was aimed at ensuring that the deceased had a successful journey into the afterlife. The Egyptians believed that the afterlife was a continuation of life on earth and that the deceased would require certain items and spells to navigate the journey. One of the ethical values that were held in Funerary Magic was the idea that the deceased should be given a proper burial and that their soul should be free to continue its journey. The use of magic in Funerary Magic was considered ethical as long as it was used to aid the deceased in their journey.
Popular Magic was practiced by ordinary people and involved the use of household magic and amulets. Popular Magic was used for personal gain and was aimed at protecting oneself from harm. One of the ethical values that were held in Popular Magic was the idea that magic should not be used to harm others. Magic was considered ethical as long as it was used for personal gain in line with Ma'at.
In some cases, the use of magic in Ancient Egypt could contradict ethical criteria. For example, in the Coffin Texts, there are spells that can be interpreted as manipulative and aimed at controlling the actions of others. In Spell 1030, the deceased is given the power to control the movements of the gods and was instructed to use this power to get what he wanted. This type of magic goes against the ethical values of the Ancient Egyptians as it is not in line with Ma'at.
Similarly, in the Book of the Dead, there are spells that could be interpreted as unethical. Spell 125, for example, involves the use of blood to summon the gods and goddesses. The use of blood in this context could be seen as unethical as it involves sacrificing a living being for personal gain.
The use of Greek Magical Papyri also presents ethical challenges. The Greek Magical Papyri are a collection of magical spells and rituals that were used in Ancient Egypt from the Hellenistic period onwards. These spells and rituals often involve invoking Greek and Egyptian gods and goddesses and using their power to achieve personal gain. This type of magic does not align with the ethical values of the Ancient Egyptians and is not in line with Ma'at.
Furthermore, the changing nature of magic in Egyptian history also presents ethical challenges. As Egypt was invaded by various cultures, there was a blending of different magical practices. This led to the creation of new magical practices that were not in line with the ethical values of the Ancient Egyptians. For example, during the Roman occupation, there was a shift towards using magic for personal gain, and there was a deviation from the ethical values of the Ancient Egyptians.
In conclusion, the ethical values that underpinned the use of magic in Ancient Egypt were deeply connected to the concept of Ma'at and Heka. The use of magic was considered ethical as long as it was used for the greater good and in line with Ma'at. However, there were instances where the use of magic contradicted ethical criteria. In some cases, the use of magic involved manipulating the actions of others or sacrificing living beings for personal gain. The changing nature of magic in Egyptian history also presents ethical challenges. The blending of different magical practices often led to the creation of new magical practices that were not in line with the ethical values of the Ancient Egyptians.
