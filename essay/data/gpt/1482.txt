The writer’s techniques play a crucial role in shaping the readers’ understanding and perception of the characters in a literary work. The two passages, 4a) and 4b) from the novels The Shipping News by E. Annie Proulx and The God of Small Things by Arundhati Roy respectively, employ distinct writing techniques, which help in analyzing the characters Quoyle and Estha. Quoyle is depicted as a weak and insecure character seeking acceptance and validation from others, while Estha is portrayed as a victim of abuse, silence and trauma. This essay will compare and contrast the function of the writers' techniques in analyzing the characters of Quoyle and Estha in passages 4a) and 4b), respectively.
In passage 4a), E. Annie Proulx utilizes descriptive imagery and figurative language to characterize Quoyle as a meek and introverted individual. She writes, “Compared to Happy and Sad, Quoyle was a kitchen mouse. A change in the weather stirred him, the sight of the harbor, the smell of fish, the distant clatter of a steamboat’s sternwheeler.” (Proulx 5) The use of the metaphor “kitchen mouse” underscores Quoyle’s lack of confidence and his tendency to blend into the background, as if trying to avoid attention. The imagery of the harbor, fish, and steamboat evokes a sense of nostalgia and longing in Quoyle, and this helps to convey his emotional vulnerability as well. Additionally, Proulx also employs the use of repetition in this passage, “He had no shape. His face ran straight to his edges. His cheeks were different colors in a mottled way.” (Proulx 5) This repetition emphasizes Quoyle’s physical appearance, which is by no means attractive or striking, and hence reinforces his unremarkable personality.
On the other hand, Roy uses sensory details and fragmented language in passage 4b) to portray Estha’s detachment and trauma. She writes, “Estha drained the tumbler. It was wet with fingerprints that weren’t his. There was a moist circle on the table, like a sweat-stained message.” (Roy 102) The use of sensory details such as fingerprints and sweat-stains are symbols of abuse and trauma. The repetition of the adjective “moist” reinforces the sense of unpleasantness and discomfort associated with these experiences. Furthermore, the use of fragmented language in this passage is a stylistic choice that reflects Estha’s psychological detachment from his surroundings, which is a result of his traumatic experiences. The sentence “He looked around to see who was watching. Nobody was” (Roy 102) is an example of this, as the short and incomplete sentences emphasize Estha’s inability to connect with others emotionally.
Moreover, Proulx utilizes the technique of dialogue and internal monologue to provide insight into Quoyle’s thoughts and feelings, which adds more depth to his character. For example, when Quoyle asks his aunt Agnis, “Why was he so unpopular?” (Proulx 5) the use of dialogue helps to establish the insecurity and social anxiety that Quoyle experiences. His internal monologue, “He felt as if the string of his life had been wound out to its fullest extension, then suddenly jerked clean, shuddering him. He knew he would never be happy in New York again” (Proulx 5) is an example of how Proulx makes use of internal monologue to suggest Quoyle’s emotional turmoil and disorientation when he is away from his home and familiar surroundings.
Similarly, Roy utilizes the technique of shifting perspectives and stream of consciousness to reveal Estha’s fragmented memories and dissociation from his own experiences. For instance, the paragraph begins with Estha’s perspective, but then switches to his twin sister Rahel’s point of view. This change in perspective serves to highlight the undercurrents of tension and anxiety that exist between the siblings, which is prevalent throughout the novel. Additionally, the use of fragmented sentences in Estha’s stream of consciousness, “In the egg-carton darkness of the box the white of a broken shell struggled up. It flailed and flailed and fell back. Not like a flower, but like a worm. In the fairy tale, Rosaleen knew that when a white rose dried, its petals turned to snow. But this was not a fairy tale. This was not snow, but the white of egg.” (Roy 102) emphasize his dissociative state of mind, a result of the abuse he has suffered as a child. The erratic changes in tone and perspective portray the vulnerability and fear that Estha must confront as he tries to make sense of his traumatic experiences.
While both writers employ distinctive language and techniques to analyze their characters, they do share certain similarities in terms of how they portray Quoyle and Estha. One of these similarities is the use of contrasting imagery to highlight the characters' emotional states. Proulx uses the familiar harbor and coastline imagery of Newfoundland to communicate Quoyle’s longing for familiarity and security, whereas Roy deploys the use of harsh, oppressive language, further emphasizing Estha’s perpetually traumatic state of mind. Both writers use specific details to illustrate their characters' idiosyncrasies and how they have come to be shaped by their past experiences. For instance, Quoyle’s insecure and introverted nature can be attributed to his father’s abuse and his mother’s suicide, while Estha’s mental fragility is borne out of his sexual abuse at the hands of his cousin.
In conclusion, the writers' techniques in passages 4a) and 4b) reveal the intricate nature of the characters Quoyle and Estha. E. Annie Proulx uses descriptive imagery and dialogue to reveal Quoyle’s emotional vulnerability and meek personality, while Roy employs fragmented language and shifting perspectives to reveal Estha’s emotional detachment and trauma. Although these techniques differ in style and approach, both writers seek to create more nuanced and complex characters through their use, and in turn, evoke empathy and understanding in their readers as they follow along on the characters' journeys.
