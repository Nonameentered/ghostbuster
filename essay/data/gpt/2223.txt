The universe is a fascinating cosmos, full of mysteries so complex that even the most brilliant scientists are left to ponder and study them. One such mystery is the nature of the universe's expansion, which is one of the most significant scientific discoveries of the 20th century. Several physicists and astronomers have studied the phenomenon and developed various theories to understand the underlying mechanisms behind it. This essay aims to explore the evidence that led physicists to conclude that the universe is expanding, the evolution of expanding universe theory, the observations made by Edwin Hubble, and the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation.
The origins of modern cosmology are inextricably linked to Albert Einstein, who, in 1915, published his theory of general relativity. Einstein's theory postulates that space and time are not separate entities but one continuum. Furthermore, the presence of matter causes the curvature of spacetime. A few years later, in 1922, Aleksandr Friedman used the theory to develop the first models of an expanding universe.
Even with mathematical calculations supporting the idea of an expanding universe, which meant that things would be getting farther apart from each other, it was difficult to prove it experimentally. It took Edwin Hubble to prove the theory through observations. Hubble, who was a pioneer in observational astronomy, was the first man to show that there were galaxies beyond our own. He did this by using a new telescope, which he paired with a camera and spectrograph.
Using images obtained from this telescope, Hubble discovered that there were galaxies beyond the Milky Way, and that these galaxies appeared to be moving away from us. This observation was the first real proof of an expanding universe. The speed at which each galaxy was moving away from us was proportional to how far it was from the Earth. This implied that the universe was expanding uniformly in all directions. The discovery was a revelation that significantly impacted cosmology, with the idea of an expanding universe becoming a well-established scientific concept.
The observation that the universe is expanding fundamentally changes our understanding of the universe. Scientists now believe that the universe began as a singularity, a point of infinite density and temperature. The big bang theory explains that the universe has been expanding ever since its inception. This explains why the universe looks the way it does now, with the galaxies getting farther apart from each other with time.
Cosmic microwave background radiation is another piece of evidence that supports the expanding universe theory. In 1965, radio engineers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were experimenting with a large microwave detector designed to pick up weak radio signals. They discovered an unexpected signal that was all-pervasive, producing a low-level hiss like noise in their instrument. After some investigation, they realized that their detector was picking up the “echo” of the big bang. This signal documented minute fluctuations in the universe’s early structure, providing strong evidence that our universe was born of a big bang.
With these three pieces of evidence in hand, astronomers and physicists began to piece together the evolving history of the universe. The universe's expansion means that the galaxies were closer together in the past than they are now. Extrapolating this backward in time reveals that the universe was much denser and hotter, ultimately leading to the formation of galaxies. Furthermore, cosmic microwave background radiation's discovery also indicates that the universe is isotropic, meaning that it has the same physical properties in all directions, providing strong support for the big bang theory.
Despite the significant discoveries made by Einstein, Hubble, and so many others, our understanding of the universe is still incomplete. There is still much to learn about what the universe is primarily composed of, what dark energy and dark matter are, and even the more basic of questions like its age. These fundamental questions raise another limitation of expanding forest theory, our current limitations in observations, and the relatively short timescale of the human experience. For example, Hubble's observations were limited to the visible stars and galaxies. Astronomers didn't have tools like the radio telescopes of today, which can observe radiation from the distant galaxies and help build a more complete picture of the universe.
Despite significant advancements, our instruments and techniques can only see so far into space, figuratively and literally. The universe is vast and dazzling, but our current understanding is restricted by the limits of our observation of the vast stretches of space and time. In some ways, it's like peering into the vast ocean through a tiny porthole. There could be much more than we can currently see.
In conclusion, the universe's expanding nature is one of the most significant findings in modern-day cosmology. Edwin's observations that the galaxies beyond milky way were moving away from the Earth was a groundbreaking discovery that fundamentally changed cosmological thinking. Cosmic microwave background radiation's discovery further confirmed the expanding universe theory, ultimately leading to a better understanding of the universe's origin and evolution. Despite this, physics and astronomy are still in the infancy stage compared to the entire universe, leaving us with many unknowns and vast amounts of space and time that we have yet to explore fully.
