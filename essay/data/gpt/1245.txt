Laboratory sessions that involve testing biomaterials using a materials testing machine have a primary objective of determining the mechanical properties of the biomaterial in question. The mechanical properties of any material are essential as they determine how the biomaterial will perform under stress, and the information is critical in various fields such as biomedical engineering, material science, and material design. Biomaterials can be subjected to several testing processes, with the tensile testing process being one of the most commonly used methods in materials testing. This paper seeks to describe the objective of a laboratory session that involves testing biomaterials using a materials testing machine, explain how the tensile testing process is conducted, demonstrate how factors such as heat treatment, prior history of plastic deformation, strain rate, and temperature affect the nature of the stress-strain curve for materials and how this information can be used to measure the ductility of materials, and finally, highlight some limitations of the testing process and how they affect the accuracy of the results. 
The primary objective of a laboratory session that involves testing biomaterials using a materials testing machine is to determine the mechanical properties of the biomaterial under investigation. Mechanical properties can be defined as a measure of a material's ability to resist deformation, changes in shape, or even fractures when subjected to an external force. The key mechanical properties that are commonly tested include tension, compression, bending, fatigue, elasticity, and fracture toughness. For biomaterials, mechanical properties also help to determine the ability of the material to integrate into the host tissue, the formation of bone tissue, the stability of the implant, and the biocompatibility of the material. Mechanical tests on biomaterials can, therefore, be used to determine the efficacy of the implant or the material in question. 
The tensile testing procedure involves pulling a sample of the biomaterial until it breaks, while simultaneously measuring the stress and strain of the material. The testing process is designed to determine the tensile strength, yield strength, and modulus of elasticity of the biomaterial. In the tensile testing procedure, the test sample is usually machined into a standard shape and size according to the ASTM standards before being placed into the materials testing machine. The specimen is clamped between two grips, one of which is attached to the crosshead, which moves vertically upward. The other grip serves as an anchor point that holds the material in place (Chaffey, 2020). The test specimen is then subjected to an increasing tensile load, and the deformation of the material is measured using strain gauges attached to the sample. 
Stress and strain are the two primary measurements obtained during tensile testing. Stress is the amount of force applied per unit area, while strain is the relative change in length or deformation caused by the applied stress. The stress-strain curve produced during the tensile test provides useful information about the biomaterial's mechanical properties. This curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between stress and strain of the biomaterial when it is subjected to an increasing tensile load. Several parameters are obtained from the stress-strain curve, including the ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, and the modulus of elasticity. 
The ultimate tensile strength of a biomaterial is the maximum stress that the material can withstand before failure. It is defined as the stress measured at the point that the material fails. The yield strength, on the other hand, is the stress point where the material starts to deform plastically, which is considered permanent deformation. The modulus of elasticity or Young's Modulus is a measure of the biomaterial's stiffness and its ability to resist deformation under stress. It can be calculated as the ratio of stress to the corresponding strain between two points on the stress-strain curve. 
Several factors may affect the nature of the stress-strain curve for biomaterials. Some of these factors are heat treatment, prior history of plastic deformation, strain rate, and temperature. The heat treatment process can be defined as a process of subjecting a material to a series of operations designed to improve its properties, such as the biomaterial's resistance to deformation. Heat treatment can affect the strength, ductility, and toughness of a material. When a biomaterial is subjected to prior history plastic deformation, it may develop residual stress that affects the properties of the material. Strain rate refers to the speed at which the biomaterial is subjected to deformation during the tensile test, while the temperature refers to the temperature at which the biomaterial is subjected to the tensile test. These factors can significantly impact the tensile behavior of biomaterials. 
The ductility of a biomaterial can be determined by analyzing the stress-strain curve. Ductility is the measure of how much a material can deform before it fractures and is commonly measured as the percentage of total strain at the point of failure. In general, the greater the ductility of a biomaterial, the easier it is for it to be shaped and fabricated. The ductility of a biomaterial is generally viewed as desirable, but it can also contribute to limitations in the strength and durability of the material. By analyzing the tensile behavior of a biomaterial and determining its ductility, researchers can develop materials designs that maximize the biomaterial's benefits while minimizing limitations. 
One of the biggest potential limitations of the testing process relates to the variability of the biomaterials. Biomaterials can vary significantly in terms of their physical and mechanical properties, which can affect the accuracy of the results obtained from the testing process. The testing methodology used can also affect the results of the test outcomes. Additionally, the geometry of the sample could also affect the results, especially when the shape or size of the sample is not consistent throughout the test. Another limitation is the possibility of extraneous biologic factors affecting the results, such as environmental conditions or biological reactions that could cause the biomaterial to degrade or shift at some point during the testing process. Finally, proper alignment of the sample is critical to ensuring accurate results, and improper alignment could lead to a phenomenon known as "necking" and an inaccurate stress-strain curve. 
In conclusion, the primary objective of a laboratory session that involves testing biomaterials using a materials testing machine is to determine the mechanical properties of the biomaterial under investigation. The tensile testing process is one of the primary methods used in materials testing, and it involves pulling the sample of the biomaterial until it breaks, while simultaneously measuring the stress and strain. Several factors may affect the tenacity behavior of biomaterials, including heat treatment, prior history plastic deformation, strain rate, and temperature. Despite the limitations of the testing process, tensile testing remains a crucial method in the evaluation of biomaterials' mechanical properties, and it provides valuable information that can be used for various applications.
