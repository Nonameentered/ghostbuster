Massacres in the twentieth century have claimed millions of lives, and have left indelible scars on human history. The brutality of these events has sparked a great deal of academic and popular interest in understanding the factors that led to them, as well as their similarities and differences. While each of these events is unique in its own right, there are some common factors that contributed to their occurrence. This essay aims to identify these factors using examples such as the Holocaust, Armenian genocide, Cambodia, Bosnia, and Nanking.
One common factor among all these massacres is the ideological motivation behind them. All of these events were driven by deeply-held religious, ethnic, or political ideologies. In the Armenian genocide, for example, the Ottoman Empire targeted the Armenian population because they were seen as a threat to the stability of the Empire. Similarly, under the Pol Pot regime, the Khmer Rouge pursued a radical socialist agenda, targeting any group deemed as a potential threat to its vision of a perfect society. In Nazi Germany, Hitler and his followers aimed to establish an Aryan race as the dominant ethnicity, and consequently, eliminated Jews, homosexuals, Romani, and non-Aryan people. These ideologies reflect deep-seated prejudices and beliefs that lead individuals and states to take extreme and violent measures.
Secondly, all of these events were characterized by extreme levels of violence and brutality. For instance, in Bosnia, both Serbian and Croat nationalists targeted Bosniak Muslims, Bosnian Croats, and other non-nationalist Bosnians. They carried out mass rapes, mutilation, and torture of the victims, and used concentration camps to impose terror on the population. Similarly, in Nanking, during the Japanese invasion of China, the Imperial Japanese Army committed atrocities such as rape, torture, and murder of tens of thousands of Chinese civilians and prisoners of war. It is notable that the violence in all of these cases was organized and systematic, with state actors often being involved in the planning and implementation of the massacres.
Thirdly, massacres are often characterized by a culture of impunity. The perpetrators are often shielded from punishment, either by state actors willing to protect them or by the lack of political will to bring them to trial. In the case of Nanking, for instance, the Japanese government denied the events and refused to acknowledge its responsibility. Similarly, in Bosnia and Cambodia, the international community, particularly the United Nations (UN), was slow to respond, allowing the perpetrators to continue their violence. This culture of impunity often leads to further violence, as the perpetrators continue to operate under the belief that they can act without consequence.
Despite these common factors, there are also important differences between each of these massacres. One significant difference between the events is the scale of violence inflicted. The Holocaust, for instance, remains the largest genocide in modern history, with at least six million Jews murdered by the Nazi regime. In comparison, the Armenian genocide saw the murder of one million Armenians, Cambodia witnessed the deaths of approximately two million Cambodians, while Bosnia experienced the deaths of at least 200,000 people. In Nanking, as many as 300,000 people lost their lives during the six weeks of violence. The scale of violence, therefore, is a significant difference among these events and reflects the specific historical contexts in which they occurred.
Another important difference between these events is the role of state actors in the violence. In the case of Nanking and the Holocaust, the state was directly involved in the planning and execution of the violence. In Nanking, the Japanese Imperial Army systematically massacred Chinese civilians, while the Holocaust saw German authorities implement policies that aimed to eradicate the Jewish population across Europe. In Bosnia and Cambodia, state actors were also responsible for the violence, but they operated within a broader ideological framework that allowed non-state actors to contribute to the genocide. This allowed local militias and paramilitary groups to participate in the violence, often under the protection of the state.
In addition, it is worth noting the different responses to these events from the international community. In the case of the Holocaust, world leaders were slow to respond, with the Allies failing to prioritize the liberation of concentration camps and halt the genocide whilst it was happening. However, the Nuremberg Trials and the establishment of the United Nations in the aftermath of World War II signaled a critical shift in the international community's response to mass violence. In the case of Bosnia, after several failed peace agreements, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) intervened militarily to halt the violence. Similarly, in the case of Cambodia, the global community mobilized to provide humanitarian relief and restore democratic governance. These differences show that the international community's responses are crucial in determining the course and outcomes of the events, as well as the accountability of the perpetrators for their actions.
In conclusion, analyzing the factors that link these massacres is important in order to understand the underlying causes of these events. The ideological motivations, extreme levels of violence, and culture of impunity are all key factors shaping the nature and course of the atrocities witnessed during the twentieth century. While each of these events is unique and has specific historical contexts, history reveals crucial commonalities across the different cases, which help us to identify the root cause of these brutalities. By drawing on examples such as the Holocaust, Armenian genocide, Cambodia, Bosnia, and Nanking, it is possible to trace these factors' effects and understand the enormity of the human tragedy that they caused.
