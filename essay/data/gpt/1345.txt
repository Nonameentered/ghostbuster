Women’s movements all over the world have been fighting for gender equality and women’s empowerment for centuries. However, it is important to recognize that not all women experience the same forms of subordination or oppression. Women’s experiences of marginalization are often influenced by their socio-economic class, ethnicity, and religion. Therefore, a successful women’s movement should be able to work with intersections of class and ethnicity to promote women’s emancipation.
In Uganda, women’s movements have been able to tackle the intersectional challenges facing women in the country. The women’s movement in Uganda comprises several organizations, such as the Forum for Women in Democracy (FOWODE) and the Uganda Women’s Network (UWONET). These organizations have successfully mobilized women across the country to push for their rights in different ways.
One of the challenges facing women in Uganda is access to education. Although the government made primary education free, many girls still miss school due to poverty, early marriages, teen pregnancy, among other factors. A study conducted by Plan International indicates that 35 percent of girls between the ages of 13 and 19 have either dropped out of school or never attended school.
The women’s movement in Uganda has been working to address the issue of girls’ education. For example, FOWODE launched the ‘Keeping Girls in School’ campaign, which focuses on supporting girls to complete their education. The campaign provides scholarships, mentoring, and psycho-social support to girls from different backgrounds. FOWODE also supports advocacy efforts to promote access to education for girls.
Another issue that women’s movements in Uganda have been tackling is gender-based violence (GBV). Women and girls continue to experience violence in their homes, schools, communities, and workplaces. According to the Uganda Demographic Health Survey, over 50 percent of women in Uganda have experienced either physical or sexual violence in their lifetime.
To address this issue, women’s organizations have been advocating for policies and laws that protect women and girls from GBV. For instance, UWONET launched the ‘Ending Violence against Women and Girls’ campaign, which advocates for the effective implementation of the Domestic Violence Act and the Sexual Offenses Bill. The campaign also conducts awareness-raising activities to sensitize communities on GBV and support survivors to access justice.
These examples illustrate how women’s movements in Uganda are working to promote women’s rights and empowerment. However, it is important to recognize that not all women have the same experiences. Women’s experiences are diverse, and they are often influenced by their socio-economic class, ethnicity, and religion.
For instance, women from poor rural areas may face more serious challenges than those from urban centers. Women from some ethnic groups may experience discrimination or cultural practices that restrict their access to rights and opportunities. Therefore, women’s movements should work to address these differences within their constituencies to ensure inclusiveness and unity towards achieving gender equality.
One strategy that women’s movements can use is to build alliances with other social justice movements. For instance, women’s movements can collaborate with movements fighting for economic justice, human rights, environmental justice, among others. Through these collaborations, women’s movements can leverage their goals and reach a wider audience.
Another strategy is to ensure the representation of diverse women in leadership positions within women’s organizations. Women’s organizations should provide opportunities for women from different socio-economic, ethnic, and religious backgrounds to lead and participate in decision-making processes.
Furthermore, women’s movements should consider developing intersectional programs and policies that reflect the needs and interests of diverse women. For instance, women’s organizations can provide different types of resources and support to women from poor rural areas than those from the urban centers.
In conclusion, women’s movements can work with intersections of class and ethnicity to fight women’s subordination and promote women’s empowerment. Women’s movements in Uganda have been able to mobilize women to push for their rights through various campaigns and advocacy activities. However, women’s movements should consider the diverse backgrounds of women and develop inclusive and intersectional strategies to achieve gender equality. By addressing the differences within their constituencies, women’s movements can promote unity and solidarity across sectors to achieve long-lasting and sustainable changes.
