Introduction
Gearboxes are frequently used in applications where speed and power need to be transferred from a source to an output load with a different speed or power rating. A gearbox consists of an input shaft, an output shaft, gears, bearings, and a housing. It functions to adjust the torque and speed of the output shaft as per the requirement by transferring the energy. An epicyclic gearbox is suitable for applications that require precise speed or torque reduction. Epicyclic gearboxes are miniature in size and offer substantial speed reduction with high efficiency. In this essay, we will design a compact gearbox for an electric drill that uses an epicyclic two-stage reduction to produce a 25:1 speed reduction from a motor developing 36W at 9000rpm. We will compare our design with similar commercial units and also designing a bearing arrangement to carry the thrust load axially along the drill.
Design of Compact Gearbox
A compact gearbox for an electric drill needs to be capable of transmitting power while also being small in size and lightweight. Therefore, we will use an epicyclic two-stage reduction for the gearbox. It will consist of two stages. The first stage will have nylon gears, and the second stage will use phosphor bronze material. We will use a minimum recommended sun gear of 16 teeth and a module of 1.0. We will also consider the use of plastic gears for one stage of speed reduction.
The first stage of the gearbox will consist of a sun gear, a ring gear, and two planet gears. The sun gear will have 16 teeth, and it will be connected to the input shaft. The ring gear will have 64 teeth, and it will be the output of the first stage. The two identical planet gears will have 24 teeth each. The input shaft, sun gear, and planet gears will be made of nylon. The ring gear will be made of phosphor bronze.
The second stage of the gearbox will consist of a sun gear, a ring gear, and two planet gears. The sun gear will have 16 teeth, and it will be connected to the output of the first stage. The ring gear will have 100 teeth, and it will be the output of the second stage. The two identical planet gears will have 46 teeth each. The sun gear, ring gear, and planet gears will be made of phosphor bronze.
The speed reduction ratio of the gearbox will be calculated as follows:
Speed reduction ratio = (Teeth of Ring Gear in Stage 1 + Teeth of Ring Gear in Stage 2)/(Teeth of Sun Gear in Stage 1 + Teeth of Sun Gear in Stage 2)
= (64+100)/(16+16)
= 25
The gearbox we designed will give a 25:1 speed reduction. It will produce a speed of 360 rpm from an input speed of 9,000 rpm when the electric drill's motor is developing 36W.
Comparison of Our Design with Similar Commercial Units
Our proposed design of a compact gearbox is an epicyclic two-stage reduction to produce a 25:1 speed reduction. It uses a minimum recommended sun gear of 16 teeth and a module of 1.0, with the first stage using nylon gears and the second stage using phosphor bronze. The speed reduction ratio of our gearbox is 25:1, which means that it will produce a speed of 360 rpm from an input speed of 9,000 rpm when the electric drill's motor is developing 36W. The advantages of using our design are that it is small in size, lightweight, and has a high speed reduction ratio with high efficiency. It is also less noisy and more wear-resistant. However, it has some limitations, such as it has less torsional strength and requires more maintenance.
Similarly, many other commercial units are available in the market, such as Makita, Bosch, and DeWalt. These brands provide a wide range of electric drills and gearboxes. For instance, Makita offers the Multi-Contact Gearbox, which has a planetary-gear design that reduces friction and increases transmission efficiency. While Bosch provides Electronic Clutching System that helps to maintain control over twists, especially in drilling modes, and reduce the chances of sudden torque surges. DeWalt, on the other hand, provides all-metal transmission that ensures the continuity of transmission flow and a seamless flow of energy to prevent any breakage along the way. However, these commercially available gearboxes are large in size, heavyweight, produce more noise, and have a low-speed reduction ratio.
Bearing Arrangement to Carry the Thrust Load Axially Along the Drill
The thrust load axially is the force generated by the user's hand or the workpiece onto the drill's head during the drilling operation. Therefore, the bearing arrangement is necessary to carry the thrust load axially along the drill. We will use a ball bearing arrangement to carry the thrust load. The ball bearing consists of an outer ring, an inner ring, and a number of steel balls in between them. The bearing arrangement will be placed between the gearbox and the drill head.
The bearing arrangement will consist of two ball bearings. A single bearing can take axial thrust from one direction, but two bearings can take axial thrust from both directions. We will use two bearings to carry the thrust load axially along the drill. The outer ring of the bearing will be in contact with the inner surface of the drill's housing, and the inner ring will be in contact with the rotating shaft of the gearbox. The balls will be placed between the two races.
The maximum thrust a user can exert on the drill is around 150N. Therefore, the bearing arrangement must be designed to carry this thrust load. For example, if two ball bearings are used, the thrust load will be evenly distributed between them. Therefore, each bearing must be capable of carrying a thrust load of 75N. The selection of the bearing size will be based on the bearing manufacturer's catalog and the maximum thrust load rating provided by them.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have designed a compact gearbox for an electric drill that uses an epicyclic two-stage reduction. The first stage uses nylon gears, and the second stage uses phosphor bronze. We have also considered the use of plastic gears for one stage of speed reduction. The speed reduction ratio of the gearbox is 25:1, and it produces a speed of 360 rpm from an input speed of 9,000 rpm when the electric drill's motor is developing 36W. We have compared our design with similar commercial gearboxes and found that our design is smaller in size, lightweight, and has a higher speed reduction ratio. We have also designed a bearing arrangement to carry the thrust load axially along the drill, considering the maximum thrust a user can exert onto the drill.
