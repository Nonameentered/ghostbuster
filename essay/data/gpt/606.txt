Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is a powerful tool used in the field of nanoscience to study the structure and properties of materials at the atomic level. The technique was first invented by Gerd Binning and Heinrich Rohrer in 1981, which later earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986. STM is based on the principle of quantum tunnelling, wherein a sharp metal tip is used to scan the surface of a sample, and the resulting quantum tunnelling current between the tip and the sample is measured and analyzed. This essay will explore what STM is, how it differs from previous surface analysis methods, its applications, and challenges.
STM is a high-resolution imaging technique, which can resolve individual atoms on a surface. The technique relies on the fact that electrons can tunnel across a very small vacuum gap (a few ångströms) between the tip and sample. The STM tip is usually made of tungsten, platinum-iridium, or gold, which is wedged into a sharp point and attached to a piezoelectric scanner. A piezoelectric scanner is a device that can move the tip in response to an electrical signal, allowing it to scan the surface of the sample. The sample is usually placed on a conductive substrate, such as metal or semiconductor, to provide a reference for the electrical measurements.
In STM, the tip is positioned close enough to the sample surface that the electrons can tunnel through the vacuum gap. The distance between the tip and sample is controlled through feedback mechanisms to maintain a constant tunnelling current. As the tip is scanned across the surface, the tunnelling current is recorded and used to create a map of the surface. This map serves as an image of the surface, with each pixel representing the local tunnelling current. By measuring the current as a function of the tip-sample distance, the electronic density of states of the sample can also be inferred. This information can be used to study the electronic properties of the sample.
STM is different from previous surface analysis methods in several ways. Earlier methods, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), relied on the interaction between an electron beam or a physical probe and the sample surface. In SEM, a high-energy electron beam is focused onto the sample surface, causing secondary electrons to be emitted from the surface. The emitted electrons are then detected, which provides information about the surface topography. In AFM, a physical probe is used to scan the surface, and the interaction between the probe and sample is measured to determine the topography and mechanical properties of the sample.
STM is different from SEM and AFM since it measures the quantum tunneling current between the sample and the probe. By relying on quantum tunneling, STM can achieve higher spatial resolution than SEM and AFM methods. STM can achieve atomic resolution, while SEM and AFM can only reach resolutions on the order of tens of nanometers. In addition, STM can distinguish between different electronic states of the sample due to its ability to directly measure the electronic density of states.
Due to its high spatial resolution and ability to measure electronic properties, STM is a powerful tool in various scientific fields, including surface science, materials science, and condensed matter physics. STM has been used to study surfaces of various materials, such as metals, semiconductors, and insulators. In surface science, STM is used to study the adsorption of molecules and atoms on surfaces. STM has also been used to study the electronic properties of materials, including the density of states of electronic energy levels, the band structure of semiconductors, and the distribution of dopants in a semiconductor.
One of the challenges of using STM is the preparation of the sample. STM requires smooth and atomically flat surfaces to achieve high resolution images. In addition, the sample must be conductive or semiconducting for the technique to work. Preparing the sample involves various steps, including cleaning, annealing, and deposition, which can be time-consuming and technically challenging. Another challenge of using STM is the requirement for a stable, low-vibration environment. Any vibrations or noise can interfere with the measurements and reduce the resolution of the images.
In conclusion, STM is a powerful tool used in nanoscience to study the atomic structure and electronic properties of materials. STM uses quantum tunneling to achieve high spatial resolution, allowing it to resolve individual atoms on a surface. Compared to previous surface analysis methods, STM can distinguish between different electronic states of a sample and achieve atomic resolution. STM has various applications in surface science, materials science, and condensed matter physics. However, STM also has challenges, including the requirement for a smooth and atomically flat sample surface and the need for a stable, low-vibration environment.
