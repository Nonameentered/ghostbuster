Introduction
Corporate manslaughter is a criminal offence where a corporation is found responsible for the death of an employee or other individuals as a result of a gross breach of duty of care. The law on corporate manslaughter has been debated extensively as it has evolved over time. The effectiveness of the law and its application has been called into question as some argue that it fails to hold corporations accountable for the actions of its employees, while others argue that it unfairly targets individuals who may not necessarily be directly responsible for the death. This essay will explore the effectiveness of the law on corporate manslaughter, the debate on how to attribute fault to a corporation, and the possibility of reform. Specific examples will be used to highlight the potential liability of individuals, such as Malcolm, in cases of workplace deaths.
Attributing Fault to a Corporation
One of the main debates around corporate manslaughter is how to attribute fault to a corporation. The law in the UK requires that the breach of duty must be at a senior level, and it must be a gross breach of duty. However, it is often difficult to identify an individual who can be held responsible for the death. This is because corporations have complex structures, and decisions are often made by several individuals at different levels. 
The case of R v Cotswold Geotechnical Holdings Ltd highlighted this issue. In this case, a geologist was killed when a trench collapsed, and the company was charged with corporate manslaughter. However, the company was a small family-owned business, and the sole director was the geologist's employer, who was also the only shareholder. The court found that the employer was responsible for the death because he had failed to ensure that the trench was properly supported. He was fined £385,000, and the company was fined £500,000, an amount that was so large that it effectively put the company out of business. Some argued that this case was a miscarriage of justice because the company was small, and it seemed unfair to hold a sole director responsible for the death. 
The possibility of reform
Given the challenges in attributing fault to a corporation, some argue that the law on corporate manslaughter needs reform. One proposal is to introduce a new offence of corporate homicide, which would require a lower threshold for conviction. This would mean that it would be easier to prosecute a company for the death of an employee, and the focus would shift to systemic failures within the company, rather than identifying an individual who can be held responsible. However, others argue that this would be unfair to companies and could lead to a culture of blame. 
The Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007
In 2007, the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act was introduced in the UK. The act was seen as a significant step in holding corporations accountable for the deaths of their employees. The act defines the offence of corporate manslaughter as "when the way in which an organisation's activities are managed or organised causes a person's death, and amounts to a gross breach of a relevant duty of care owed by the organisation to the deceased." The act provides a framework for investigating and prosecuting corporations for corporate manslaughter, and it specifies the penalties that can be imposed. 
The effectiveness of the Act
The Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act has been in force for over a decade, and there have been several high-profile cases. In 2016, the construction company, Conquest Homes, was fined £200,000 after a worker was killed when a wall collapsed on him. The investigation found that the company had breached several health and safety regulations, and the level of fines imposed on the company was seen as a significant deterrent. In another case, the construction company, Lion Steel Ltd, was fined £480,000 after a worker was killed when a steel beam fell on him. The fines imposed in these cases were significant, and they were seen as a strong message to other companies about the importance of safety in the workplace. 
The potential liability of individuals
While the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act provides a framework for prosecuting corporations, it also raises questions about the potential liability of individuals such as directors, managers and employees. In some cases, individuals have been charged with manslaughter, particularly in cases where there is evidence of wilful neglect or a flagrant disregard for safety. 
In the case of R v. Malcolm, Malcolm was the director of a company that manufactured and installed roller shutters. A worker was crushed and killed when a roller shutter door collapsed on him. The company was charged with corporate manslaughter, and Malcolm was charged with manslaughter. The court found that Malcolm had been reckless in his duties and had failed to take appropriate safety measures, and he was sentenced to two years in prison. This case highlights the potential liability of individuals in cases of workplace deaths, and it serves as a warning to directors and managers that they could be held personally responsible. 
Conclusion
In conclusion, the law on corporate manslaughter has evolved over time, and there is ongoing debate about its effectiveness. While the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act provides a framework for prosecuting corporations, there are concerns that it sometimes fails to hold corporations accountable for the actions of their employees. There is also debate about how to attribute fault to a corporation, particularly in cases where decision-making is complex. The case of R v Cotswold Geotechnical Holdings Ltd highlighted this issue. However, the act has been effective in deterring companies from breaching safety regulations, and the fines imposed in some cases have been significant. The act also raises questions about the potential liability of individuals, particularly directors and managers. The case of R v. Malcolm serves as a warning that individuals could be held personally responsible in cases of workplace deaths. In conclusion, there is a need for ongoing debate about the law on corporate manslaughter and its effectiveness, particularly in light of the changing nature of work and the increasing complexity of corporate structures.
