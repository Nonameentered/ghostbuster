The Enlightenment, a movement that took place in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries, emphasized the importance of reason and individualism, and critically assessed traditional institutions and practices. Enlightenment ideas had profound effects on the society and culture of Europe, as well as on the colonial policies of European powers. This essay will examine how the views of the Enlightenment affected colonial life in New South Wales from the first settlement in the region in 1788 until the middle of the 19th century.
Convict Transportation
The British government decided to colonize New South Wales primarily to relieve overcrowding in its prisons. The idea of transporting convicts to the colonies was supported by some Enlightenment thinkers who saw it as a way of reforming criminals and creating new sources of labor. The practice of convict transportation to New South Wales began in 1788 and continued until 1868, during which time approximately 160,000 convicts were sent to the colony.
The enlightenment’s belief in the potential of human beings to change made rehabilitation the main emphasis of the authorities’ treatment of the convicts. Punishment was viewed as a last resort, and authorities believed that convicts could be reformed into productive members of society with the right education and treatment. The underlying principle behind the penal system, or the ‘gospel of the better self,’ was seen as a way of improving the moral character of the individuals rather than inflicting them with punishment.
Despite the authorities’ good intentions, the harsh conditions of the Australian environment, and the lack of resources and personnel, meant that the treatment of convicts was not always conducive to rehabilitation. Convicts were forced to work long hours, and many were subjected to brutal punishment. The Chain Gangs forced together under the brutality of the lash, with no meaning, education, or therapy no wonder the reoffending rate in Australia was high until the late 1800s.
Treatment of Aborigines
The Enlightenment views of rationalism, individualism, and progress collided with the colonists' attitudes and treatment of the Aboriginal population. The colonists regarded the Aborigines as primitive savages who were in need of ‘civilizing.’ The Enlightenment theory of the ‘noble savage’ viewed indigenous peoples held in their natural states of purity, moral decency and that oppression by white society undermined their state. To colonists such as the explorer Captain Cook, on his arrival in Botany Bay in 1770, the Aborigines appeared backward because of their lack of clothing, huts, and agriculture.
The colonists established a policy of terra nullius, or a land belonging to no one, based on the assumption that the Aborigines did not have a concept of land ownership, a belief that denied indigenous peoples the right to their own land and culture. This policy led to violent confrontations and massacres, and the systematic destruction of Aboriginal cultures, languages, and traditions.
Agriculture and Methodology
The Enlightenment’s emphasis on scientific inquiry and rationalism led to new agricultural practices and methodologies in New South Wales. The colonists introduced new crops, such as wheat and rice, and new livestock, such as sheep and cattle, which had a significant impact on the land and the environment. New methods of farming, such as crop rotation and irrigation, were also introduced, which increased the yield and productivity of the land.
The Enlightenment’s impact on agriculture was not merely technological. Its emphasis on individualism, reason, and progress led to the belief that the land could be owned and exploited for profit. This led to the displacement of the indigenous peoples and the destruction of the natural ecosystems of the region. It also resulted in social tensions and injustices, such as land grabbing and exploitation and the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the views of the Enlightenment profoundly affected colonial life in New South Wales from the first settlement in the region until the middle of the 19th century. The policy of convict transportation was influenced by Enlightenment ideas of rehabilitation and the potential for reforming criminals. However, the harsh conditions of the Australian environment and the lack of resources meant that rehabilitation was often difficult to achieve.
The colonists’ attitudes towards the Aborigines were shaped by Enlightenment ideas of rationalism and progress, which led to the belief that indigenous peoples were savages in need of civilizing. This attitude led to the establishment of a policy of terra nullius, which resulted in the displacement of the indigenous peoples and the destruction of their cultures.
Finally, the Enlightenment’s emphasis on scientific inquiry and rationalism led to the introduction of new agricultural practices and methodologies, which increased productivity and yields but also led to the destruction of the natural ecosystems of the region and the displacement of the indigenous peoples.
In summary, while the Enlightenment had many positive aspects, its impact on colonial life in New South Wales was often negative, leading to social injustices and the destruction of indigenous cultures and environments.
