In Aphra Behn's poem "Song: Love Armed", language and form serve a dual purpose in creating a powerful and impactful message about the nature of love and relationships. Through the use of strong imagery and figurative language, Behn presents a complex view of love as both a source of strength and a potential danger.
The poem is written in the form of a traditional ballad, with five quatrains and an ABAB rhyme scheme. The use of this form serves as a nod to traditional love poetry, but Behn uses it to subvert these expectations and convey a different message. The poem's title, "Love Armed", suggests that love is not a gentle or passive emotion, but rather something forceful and powerful that must be wielded with care.
From the opening lines, Behn's language is immediate and striking. She writes that "Love in fantastic triumph sate, Whilst bleeding hearts around him flow'd." This image of love as a conqueror, seated triumphantly as hearts bleed at his feet, is vivid and powerful. It suggests that love is simultaneously a source of joy and pain, and that one cannot exist without the other.
Throughout the poem, Behn uses figurative language and imagery to convey the idea that love is something that can be used both as a weapon and a shield. She writes that love "flashed like lightning through the vale," suggesting that it is powerful and capable of causing destruction. But she also writes that love "protected every grove," suggesting that it is something that can provide safety and comfort.
Behn's language is also notable for its use of paradox and contradiction. She writes that love "Can pierce the heart with thrilling woe, / Can bid all hardy passions die." Here, Behn suggests that love is capable of both causing great pain and removing one's ability to feel any other emotion. This reflects the complexity of love and its power to both uplift and destroy.
The use of language in "Song: Love Armed" is also notable for its gendered language and imagery. Behn writes that "While armed with beauty, youth and charms, / The god of soft persuasion reigns." Here, love is personified as a masculine force, but it is also something that is closely associated with women and their ability to charm and persuade. This reflects the societal expectations of gender roles at the time when the poem was written, but it also suggests that love can be both a weapon and a tool for empowerment.
In conclusion, Aphra Behn's poem "Song: Love Armed" demonstrates the power of language and form to convey complex emotions and themes. Through her use of vivid imagery, paradox, and gendered language, Behn presents a nuanced view of love as both a source of strength and a potential danger. The poem's traditional ballad form serves as a counterpoint to its subversive message and underscores the importance of language and form in shaping our understanding of the world around us. Ultimately, "Song: Love Armed" is a powerful reminder that love is a force to be reckoned with, and that its power must be respected and understood if it is to be wielded successfully.
