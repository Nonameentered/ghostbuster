Milk is an essential source of nutrition for humans as it provides various nutrients, such as protein, minerals, vitamins, and carbohydrates. However, some factors can affect the quality of milk, such as mastitis. Mastitis is a disease that affects the udder of cows and can cause changes in the composition of milk. Chloride and lactose content are necessary components of milk that play a significant role in determining its quality. Therefore, it is important to understand the principle of the analysis used to determine the chloride content of milk and how milk from cows with mastitis differs from normal milk in terms of chloride and lactose content.
Chloride is an essential mineral that is present in milk. However, its concentration in milk varies depending on different factors. The principle of the analysis used to determine the chloride content of milk follows the Mohr method. This method works by precipitating chloride ions present in the milk sample with a silver nitrate solution. The reaction forms a white precipitate of silver chloride, which is collected and weighed. Afterward, the percentage of chloride in the milk sample is calculated by comparing the weight of the silver chloride precipitate to the weight of the original milk sample.
Mastitis is a bacterial infection that often affects cows and can lead to changes in the composition of milk. The milk from cows with mastitis differs from normal milk in terms of chloride and lactose content. Mastitis causes inflammation and damage to the mammary gland, which can cause a change in the milk’s composition. The chloride concentration in the milk increases when an infection occurs because of bacterial inflammation. In normal milk, the chloride content ranges between 0.07–0.10%. However, milk from cows with mastitis can contain chloride levels as high as 0.45% or more. This means that the chloride level in milk widely varies from normal to abnormal when mastitis takes place.
Mastitis also affects the lactose content of milk. Lactose is a carbohydrate present in milk that is responsible for its sweetness. Lactose is formed from glucose and galactose, which are produced by the mammary gland. When inflammation occurs, the mammary gland stops producing lactose or produces it at a lower rate; this leads to a reduction of lactose concentration in milk. A declined lactose level can also lead to decreased milk production in infected cows. In comparison to normal milk, mastitis milk has less sweetness due to its lower lactose level.
Moreover, Mastitis also produces other changes in milk composition such as an increased level of fat and white blood cells. For example, abnormal milk with inflammation in the udder might have 0.5% less lactose and 0.4% more fat. These microbes can result in changes of milk composition that may not be visible to the naked eye. There are numerous causes of mastitis, such as poor sanitation, low-quality feed, and milk processing equipment, among others.
In conclusion, milk is an essential source of nutrition for human beings. The quality of milk can be affected by various factors, especially mastitis. The principle of analysis used to determine the chloride content of milk follows the Mohr method. The chloride and lactose content in milk are important components that affect the quality of milk. Milk from cows with mastitis differs from normal milk in terms of chloride and lactose content. Mastitis causes an increase in chloride content and a decrease in lactose content in milk. Therefore, it is significant that cows are thoroughly taken care of to prevent the occurrence of mastitis and to maintain high-quality milk for human consumption.
