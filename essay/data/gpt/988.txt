The conquest of Mexico and the landing of Europeans in North America marked the beginning of a new era in history. These two events had a significant impact on the development of the New World and shaped the attitudes of Europeans towards Native Americans. While the conquest of Mexico was brutal and more of a military campaign, the landing of Europeans in North America was marked by colonization and trade. This essay will compare and contrast the conquest of Mexico with the landing of Europeans in North America, examining the factors that influenced the interaction between Europeans and Native Americans and how their attitudes and desires would drive their actions in the New World.
The conquest of Mexico was initiated by Spanish explorer Hernán Cortés, who arrived in the New World in 1519. Cortés was in search of wealth and glory, and he embarked on a journey to conquer the Aztec Empire. The Spanish were able to conquer the Aztecs, thanks to several factors, including their superior military technology and their ability to exploit alliances with rival tribes.
The landing of Europeans in North America, on the other hand, was motivated by a desire to expand trade and commerce. The English and French were looking for new markets to tap into, and they saw the New World as an opportunity to establish profitable colonies. Instead of conquest, colonization became the preferred method of expansion.
The interaction between Europeans and Native Americans was marked by significant differences. The Spanish were brutal in their treatment of the Native Americans, which was clear from the way they treated the Aztecs. The Spanish saw the Aztecs as inferior, and they were determined to destroy their civilization. The Spanish burned their cities and temples and killed many of the Aztecs.
In contrast, the English and French were more accommodating towards the Native Americans. They saw the Native Americans as potential allies and trading partners. The English established alliances with the Powhatan Confederacy and the Wampanoag, while the French established trade relations with the Algonquin and Iroquois Confederacy.
The attitudes and desires of the Europeans towards the Native Americans were also different. The Spanish saw the Native Americans as a means to an end - a source of wealth and labor. The English and French, on the other hand, saw the Native Americans as potential partners in commerce and trade. They were less interested in the immediate wealth that the New World offered, and more interested in establishing long-term trade relations.
Another factor that influenced the interaction between Europeans and Native Americans was religion. The Spanish were determined to convert the Native Americans to Christianity, and they often used force to accomplish this. The English and French were also interested in spreading Christianity, but they were less fervent in their efforts than the Spanish.
The differences in approach between the Spanish and the English and French had a long-term impact on the relationship between Europeans and Native Americans. The Spanish’s brutal approach led to resentment and hostility, which lasted for centuries. In contrast, the English and French were able to establish more positive relationships with the Native Americans, which allowed them to establish lasting trade partnerships.
In conclusion, the conquest of Mexico and the landing of Europeans in North America represented different approaches to expansion. The Spanish were interested in conquest and exploitation, while the English and French were more interested in trade and commerce. The attitudes and desires of the Europeans towards the Native Americans also differed, with the Spanish being more brutal and the English and French being more accommodating. These differences had a significant impact on the way that Europeans interacted with Native Americans and shaped the relationship between them, which would influence the course of history in the New World.
