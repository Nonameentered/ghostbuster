Introduction:
Prostitution is one of the oldest professions in the world, and its history traces back to ancient civilizations. Ancient Greece was no exception, and there is much evidence to suggest that prostitution was a thriving industry in ancient Greece. In this essay, we will explore the various roles of prostitutes in ancient Greece and examine whether they can be distinguished from each other.
Main body:
Prostitutes in Ancient Greece had different roles and titles depending on their status, clientele, and the context in which they worked. There were three main categories of prostitutes in ancient Greece: the pornai, the hetairai, and the porne.
1. The Pornai:
Pornai were the most abundant and least respected prostitutes in Ancient Greece. They were women of low birth who operated in the streets and brothels. They were not bound by any legal or moral constraints, and they were available to all men for a fee. The term "pornai" means "sellers of sex," and they were known as the cheapest prostitutes in ancient Greece.
Unlike the hetairai, pornai were not educated or cultured. They were usually illiterate and spoke in a dialect that was considered unrefined and vulgar. They were considered to be the lowest class of prostitutes and were often associated with debauchery and vice. They were primarily hired by working-class men and soldiers who could not afford to hire hetairai.
2. The Hetairai:
The hetairai were a higher class of prostitutes who provided more refined and sophisticated services. They were educated, charming, and cultured women who operated in upscale settings and catered to the upper echelons of society. The term "hetaira" means "companion" or "friend," and they were known for providing not only sexual services but also intellectual, emotional and artistic companionship.
The Hetairai were well-educated, spoke in standard Greek, and were often trained in music, dance, literature, and philosophy. They could easily converse with their clients on many topics, and were respected as much for their wit and culture as for their physical beauty. They were usually hired by wealthy and influential men who were looking for more than just sexual gratification.
3. The Porne:
The porne was a slave-prostitute who served in the houses of male aristocrats, wealthy merchants, or high-ranking officials. They were often purchased at a young age and trained in sexual techniques and other household skills. Unlike the pornai and the hetairai, the porne did not have any choice in whom they served, and they were considered the lowest type of prostitute.
The porne was expected to perform all kinds of sexual acts without any complaint. They were forbidden from speaking to their clients unless spoken to, and they had no social status or personal belongings. They were often abused and mistreated by their owners, and their lives were miserable and short-lived.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, prostitution was a common and accepted practice in ancient Greece, and had various roles and categories of prostitutes. The pornai, hetairai, and porne were three of the most common types of prostitutes in ancient Greece. The pornai were the cheapest and least respected of the three, while the hetairai were the most cultured and respected. The porne were the lowest of all and were often slaves. The different roles of prostitutes in ancient Greece can be distinguished from each other, based on their status, clientele, and the context in which they worked.
