Dualism is a philosophical concept that contends that there are two basic ontological categories of things in the universe, namely, material or physical substances and non-material or immaterial substances. Substance dualism, also known as Cartesian dualism, is a form of dualism that posits that the universe is composed of two basic kinds of substances – the material body and the non-material mind or soul. This essay seeks to explain the concept of substance dualism and explore the various forms of dualism. The essay focuses on Cartesian dualism, which was put forth by Rene Descartes. The essay evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of Cartesian dualism and considers the critiques posed by contemporary philosophers in the light of modern psychology and empirical evidence. 
Substance dualism is a metaphysical philosophy that assumes that there are two kinds of substances in the universe. Proponents of substance dualism claim that the universe is composed of material and a non-material substance. Material substances, also known as physical substances, are things that can be perceived by the senses or by scientific instruments, such as tables, chairs, and trees. Non-material substances, also known as immaterial substances, are things that cannot be perceived by the senses or by scientific instruments, such as the mind or the soul. 
Substance dualism has had several incarnations throughout history. The most well-known one, however, is Cartesian dualism, first put forth by Rene Descartes in the seventeenth century. Cartesian dualism argues that the universe is composed of two kinds of substances – the material body and the non-material mind or soul. The material body is defined as a physical, extended, and measurable substance, whereas the non-material mind is an unextended, non-physical, and indivisible substance. According to Descartes, the mind is not identical to the brain or any other part of the body but is instead a distinct and separate substance that interacts with the body through the pineal gland.
One of the strengths of Cartesian dualism is that it provides a clear explanation of the mental and the physical aspects of human nature. Cartesian dualism suggests that mental activity such as thinking, feeling, and perceiving are distinct, non-physical activities that cannot be fully accounted for by physical events in the brain. This view, therefore, allows for the idea that consciousness is a non-physical entity that is separate from the physical world. 
Another strength of Cartesian dualism is that it allows for the idea of free will. According to Cartesian dualism, the mind has the power to choose independently of physical causation. This view suggests that humans have the ability to make choices that are not predetermined by physical laws, which is fundamental to the concept of responsibility, ethics, and morality.
However, Cartesian dualism is not without criticisms. A significant weakness of Cartesian dualism is the interaction problem or the mind-body problem. The interaction problem asks how, in the Cartesian dualist framework, a non-physical mind or soul can interact with the physical body. According to Cartesian dualism, the mind and the body are two separate substances, which means that the mind cannot directly control physical events in the body. If this is the case, then how does the mind cause the body to move and act? This problem has never been satisfactorily resolved, and it remains a central issue for dualistic theories.
Another weakness of Cartesian dualism is that it neglects the advances made in neuroscience and psychology. The correlations between brain activity and mental states have been well-established, which suggests that mind and brain are closely interconnected. Neuroscience and psychology suggest that mental activity can be fully explained in terms of the workings of the brain, and hence, the idea of a non-physical mind seems unnecessary.
The critiques posed by contemporary philosophers have also focused on its lack of empirical evidence. Modern psychiatry, for instance, insists that mental disorders such as depression or schizophrenia can be fully explained by abnormalities in the brain. Mental processes such as memory, learning, and cognition have also been shown to have physical correlates in the brain. Psychologists who believe in the materialist view contend that all mental processes are identical with physical processes, which means that there is no need for a non-physical substance such as the mind or soul. 
In conclusion, substance dualism, or Cartesian dualism, posits that the universe is composed of two different kinds of substances – the physical and non-physical. Cartesian dualism has strong points such as explaining the mental and the physical aspects of human nature and allowing for the idea of free will. However, it has been criticized for its inability to explain the interaction problem and for neglecting the advances in neuroscience and psychology. Contemporary philosophers have expressed a need for empirical evidence, and many of them contest the view that mental states require a non-physical substance. While Cartesian dualism may continue to be a subject of philosophical debate and stand as a classic theory, its claim that the mind is distinct from and independent of the body has been challenged by empirical studies in neuroscience. Thus, the Cartesian dualism is still as valuable as it serves as a reminder of the limitations of materialism and the necessity for considering alternate explanations.
