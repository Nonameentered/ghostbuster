The ancient Romans were a polytheistic society, with a complex religious system that included both state-funded and private cults. Among the various aspects of Roman religion, one of the most intriguing is the worship of the emperor as a divine figure. While some may assume that the emperor was always considered a god-like figure, the truth is much more complex. This essay will explore the beliefs present in both the public, state-funded, and private spheres of Roman religion, analyzing the varying levels to which the emperor was worshipped as divine, the worship of the living and deceased emperors, and the political implications and power dynamics at play in their deification. It will also consider the differences in worship between the state cult and private cults, and the offerings and rituals dedicated to the emperor.
To begin, it is important to understand that the Roman people did not necessarily consider the emperor to be a god in the same sense as the deities of their pantheon. Instead, the emperor was seen as a mediator between the people and the gods, as well as a symbol of the power and authority of the state. This viewpoint developed over time, with the earliest emperors being glorified military leaders rather than fully divine figures. It was not until later in Roman history that the emperor began to be worshipped as a god.
The worship of the emperor was present in both the public, state-funded sphere of religion and in private cults. The state-funded cult of the emperor began in earnest under the rule of Augustus, the founder of the Roman Empire. Augustus encouraged the worship of himself as a divine figure, emphasizing his role as the bringer of peace and prosperity to the Roman people. This worship was not mandatory, but it was certainly encouraged, and over time it became an important element of the Roman state religion.
However, the degree to which the emperor was worshipped varied widely over time and between different emperors. Some emperors, such as Nero, were deeply unpopular with the people and were not worshipped as divine figures. Others, such as Trajan, were greatly beloved and were widely venerated as gods. Consequently, the levels of worship of the emperors varied in the public domain and depended on the individual ruler’s reputation, which could differ greatly from one time period to another.
It is also worth noting that the worship practices idealized by the state cult of the emperor were often simple and restrained and that they seldom entailed the fear and wonder associated with typical Roman religious ceremonies. This is because the imperial cult constantly aimed at creating an image of the emperor as an approachable, even human, figure despite his divine nature. Furthermore, the Imperial dogma prescribed punishment for whoever, in the official public capacity, dared to orate that the emperor was not a god.  
Private cults, on the other hand, could differ greatly from the official state cult. Individuals could venerate the emperor in their own way and in their own homes, with the emperor often being seen as a protective figure or a patron saint. Ordinary Romans might attend festivals or make offerings to the emperor in private sanctuaries. This in turn, offered an escape from the overly-straitjacketed forms of state religion, providing an opportunity for personal devotion in a society otherwise known for its grandiose temple architecture and high-octane public religious celebrations.
The private cult of the emperor may have had fewer followers than the state cult, but it was still an important part of Roman religion. It allowed individuals to connect with the emperor on a personal level, asking for his protection or guidance, while also providing an avenue for greater individual expression in a religious context. Ultimately, the private cults of the emperor illustrated a level of interaction between individual Romans and the emperor that was simply impossible within the state cult.
The worship of living emperors was usually fairly restrained, though this depended on the individual in question and their political goals. Some emperors, such as Vespasian, sought to downplay the idea of themselves as divine figures, while others, such as Caligula, actively sought worship and adulation from the people. During the reign of Alexander Severus, who was regarded as one of the fairest and most pious of the emperors, had his own godliness compared to that of Apollonius, a philosopher known for his virtuous reputation.
However, the worship of deceased emperors was much more widespread and often more elaborate. This practice known as the apotheosis, was a part of Roman funerary rites. This allowed the citizens to honor the passing emperor as both as a former ruler and as a powerful deity. This funerary ceremony often involved consecrating the former emperor's soul to the heavens. The most highly regarded emperors, such as Julius Caesar and Augustus, were often deified and were worshipped as gods long after their deaths.
The political implications of the deification of the emperor were significant, as this practice served as a way of reinforcing the authority of the Roman state. The emperor, as the embodiment of the power of Rome, was seen as deserving of veneration and worship, which in turn demonstrated the loyalty and allegiance of the people to the state. The emperor’s divine status acted as a way to legitimize the rule of the empire, as it suggested that the emperor was ordained by the gods to rule.
This was especially important during times of crisis, such as during a period of transition between emperors or after a major military defeat. By emphasizing the divine nature of the emperor, the state could present a unified front and demonstrate that despite any challenges that might come their way, the power of Rome and the emperor remained unshaken.
In terms of the differences between state and private cults, one of the key distinctions was the issue of sacrifice. State-sponsored worship of the emperor ultimately involved the performance of public sacrifices, which were a regular part of Roman religious life. The private cult of the emperor, on the other hand, often had a greater emphasis on personal devotion and prayer.
In the state cult, the offerings given to the emperor were often similar to those given to the gods, such as incense, wine, and food. This helped to emphasize the divine nature of the emperor and further reinforced the idea of the emperor as a mediator between the people and the gods. Private cults, in contrast, often involved offerings of a more personal nature, such as flowers or personal tokens. Private worship of the emperor was often seen as a way to gain favors or blessings from the emperor, as well as an opportunity to connect with him on a personal level.
In conclusion, the Romans’ belief in the emperor’s divinity was a complex and evolving part of their religious system. While the emperor was not always seen as a god-like figure, the idea of the emperor as a mediator between the people and the gods became increasingly important over time. The levels of worship of the emperors varied, depending on the ruler's reputation, and the political implications of their deification were significant, as they served as a way to legitimize the power of the state. Despite the differences between state and private cults, the worship of the emperor remained an important part of Roman religion, illustrating the complex interplay between religion, politics, and personal devotion in ancient Rome.
