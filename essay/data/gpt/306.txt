Migration has been a significant component of Britainâ€™s economic and social growth, with people coming from different parts of the world for better job opportunities and education. However, the issue of discrimination against migrants, particularly ethnic minorities, has been a persistent challenge in the country. Discrimination in housing remains one of the central factors pushing migrants into specific areas and types of accommodation. Ethnic minorities find themselves at the mercy of personal discrimination, inadequate housing, and limited access to quality living standards. This essay focuses on how discrimination against migrants in Britain leads to clustering into specific areas and types of accommodation, the effect this has on the migrant population, the relevance of the concept of housing class in the 21st century and how structural societal forces push and pull ethnic minorities into the same geographical location.
Discrimination against ethnic minorities in Britain has contributed to the clustering of these groups into specific areas. Migrants, particularly those from Africa and Asia, find themselves living in areas where other members of their ethnic group reside. Research by Eltham Commission shows that urban areas in Britain that host ethnic minority populations also have high levels of deprivation. These areas are characterized by inadequate infrastructure, poor air quality, and limited access to essential amenities such as schools, healthcare facilities, and recreational facilities (Finney et al., 2010). The discrimination these minorities face when it comes to housing and employment opportunities pushes them toward these neighborhoods out of necessity.
Furthermore, the hostile environment policy implemented under the Theresa May government limits the ability of many migrants to access essential services such as healthcare and housing. The policy requires landlords and the National Health Service (NHS) to check the immigration status of tenants and patients, making it difficult for migrants without complete paperwork to find housing and receive medical care. Consequently, ethnic minority migrants face significant struggles when searching for accommodation, leading them to settle into specific neighborhoods.
Discrimination also affects the type of accommodation migrant populations can access. Those facing discrimination are forced to seek housing that is cheap but not necessarily befitting, with landlords taking advantage of their predicament to provide sub-standard houses. Such housing offers poor living standards, including overcrowding, suboptimal heating, and inadequate hygiene conditions. These situations make it difficult for members of ethnic minority groups to access quality housing. Research has shown that UK citizens of black and minority ethnic groups are disproportionately affected by poor quality and inadequate housing (Alexander et al., 2011). Similarly, the UK government's widening the gap policy dictating that tenure types should be sufficient for the population exacerbates the situation. With limited access to quality housing, ethnic minorities are forced to cluster in specific areas and settle for suboptimal housing.
The clustering of ethnic minorities is not without consequences. One significant impact that it has on this population is the effect on their socioeconomic mobility. Ethnic minority populations in Britain face racism and discrimination in employment opportunities, which means they end up in low wage jobs with little prospects for growth. These jobs are often located in the same areas where the population clusters. Therefore, migrants find it challenging to move out of these neighborhoods.
Additionally, the clustering of ethnic minorities leads to poor social integration, with migrants struggling to connect with the broader British society. This isolation creates social and economic inequalities that limit the potential for this population to thrive and contribute positively to British society. Research has shown that this isolation leads to diminished access to public services, inadequate education, and income inequality, all of which have broad implications for the welfare of ethnic minorities and the country at large (Garratt et al., 2011). In this aspect, the clustering of ethnic minorities becomes a self-reinforcing cycle, with limited access to quality housing and employment opportunities leading to isolation and inequality, which further exacerbates the clustering.
The concept of housing class is still relevant in the 21st century and can be used to differentiate between individual ethnic minorities. Housing class refers to the socio-economic status of individuals or populations in terms of the housing they occupy. In western societies, class is typically defined by income, wealth, and education levels. Therefore, by extension, the type of housing one can afford reflects their socio-economic class. The notion of housing class is still relevant in contemporary Britain, with housing being one of the most significant indicators of class.
In Britain, the availability and quality of housing are closely linked to social class. Those at the bottom of the social scale are more likely to live in sub-standard housing or be homeless. Ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected by poor housing conditions as they typically occupy the lowest rungs of the socio-economic ladder. Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) suggests that ethnic minority groups are more than twice as likely to live in poverty compared to the white population in Britain (Souri & Tryfonas, 2019). This data indicates a strong correlation between race and poverty, with ethnic minorities being at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder.
Structural societal forces play a significant role in pushing and pulling ethnic minorities into geographical locations. Such factors include racism, inequality, and social isolation, among others. For instance, racism manifests in the form of discriminatory practices by landlords, real estate agents, and loan providers, making it difficult for ethnic minorities to find quality housing. Similarly, inequality preserves the status quo, whereby the more prominent and influential sectors of society occupy desirable residential areas, while the less fortunate must make do with the poorest housing available.
Additionally, government policies such as the affordable housing policy, which aims to build social and affordable homes, have been criticized for perpetuating discrimination against ethnic minorities. Studies have shown that the program discriminates against ethnic minorities, mainly Blacks and Asians, as they tend to be the largest groups living in poverty (Vigil & Wissink, 2020). Government policies aimed at addressing the housing crisis in Britain have ignored the racial and ethnicity component of the population, thereby exacerbating the clustering of ethnic minority populations.
Personal discrimination also plays a role in pushing ethnic minorities into geographical locations. Such discrimination comes in the form of prejudice, xenophobia, and cultural differences. Those from ethnic minority communities struggle to integrate into British society due to cultural differences, language barriers, and racism. This isolation leads them to cling to their ethnic group. Individuals often prefer to live in areas where they have access to a support system made up of friends, family, and cultural groups. The effect of personal discrimination on housing access and quality is not immediately noticeable but exacerbates the problem in the long term.
In conclusion, discrimination against migrants and ethnic minorities in Britain is a significant factor that contributes to the issue of clustering. The result is that such populations find themselves living in specific neighborhoods characterized by limited access to essential amenities, sub-standard housing conditions, and social isolation. The clustering of ethnic minorities exacerbates the cycle of poverty and inequality, limiting their potential to contribute positively to British society. The concept of housing class is still relevant in the 21st century, with ethnic minorities occupying the lowest rungs of the socio-economic ladder. Structural societal forces, government policies, and personal discrimination play a role in pushing ethnic minorities into the same geographical location. To address the clustering of ethnic minorities in Britain, there is a need for a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various factors contributing to the problem. Such an approach must involve government policies, anti-discrimination measures, community engagement, and support systems to address the needs of ethnic minority populations.
