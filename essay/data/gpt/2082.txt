Tense is often considered a straightforward feature of language, yet the reality is far more complex. English is a tense-based language, meaning that the difference between past, present, and future is encoded in the grammar and syntax of the language. However, the theoretical approaches to tense in English and its interpretation by speakers are varied and often contested. In this essay, I will explore the different theoretical approaches to tense in English and their views on the definition and existence of future tense. I will present evidence from both surface and deep structures of English and evaluate their implications for everyday language use.
The most widely accepted view is that English has two morphological tenses: past and present. The past tense is marked by the suffix -ed, while the present tense is either marked or unmarked. However, there is much debate among linguists over the existence of a future tense in English. Some argue that English does not have a future tense and instead uses modal auxiliaries or other structures to express future actions. Others suggest that English does have a future tense, marked by the auxiliary verb “will”.
A popular theoretical approach to tense is the Aspectual Approach, which views tense as a way of expressing the relationship between an event and the time of the speaker’s utterance. According to this approach, tense is a grammatical category that reflects the speaker’s perspective on the temporal structure of events. This perspective can take two major forms: aspectual and modal.
Aspectual tense refers to the speaker’s subjective perspective on the temporality of a situation. This perspective is divided into three broad categories: past, present, and future. If the speaker views a situation as completed before the time of the utterance, the situation is said to be in the past tense. If the situation is viewed as ongoing and continuing at the time of the utterance, it is in the present tense. Finally, if the speaker views the situation as yet to be completed, it is in the future tense. Under this approach, the future is not a grammatical tense that is independent of the present or past.
The modal tense approach holds that tense is a marker of the modality of a verb, reflecting the speaker’s degree of certainty or likelihood of a situation happening in the future. According to this view, future tense is not a distinct grammatical category; instead, it is expressed using modal auxiliaries to indicate probability and certainty. For example, "I may go to the movies tomorrow" or "I might go to the movies tomorrow" both express the possibility of the speaker going to the movies in the future, with varying degrees of certainty.
Another theoretical approach to tense is the Universal Time (UT) approach, which states that tense is independent of the speaker’s perspective and is instead founded in a universal temporal structure. This view suggests that there are three objective tenses: past, present, and future that are fixed and applicable regardless of the speaker’s subjective perspective. Under the UT approach, the future is a grammatical tense that is distinct from the present or past and is marked by the auxiliary verb “will”. This view argues that the future is no different from the past or present, and the only difference lies in the event's place in the temporal structure.
Despite the widely varying views on the existence of future tense in English, evidence from both the surface and deep structures of English provides some support for each approach. Surface structures refer to the way that tenses are expressed in grammatical and syntactical forms, while deep structures refer to the underlying principles of grammar that make up the foundation of a language.
For example, in English, the present progressive tense is often used to refer to future actions. "I am going to the store" is used to express a future action and is a surface-level structure that appears to support the modal or Aspectual tenses approach. However, under the deep structure, the present progressive tense is used to express ongoing actions, regardless of when the action will occur. In this sense, the deep structure supports the UT approach as the present tense can be used to describe future events.
Similarly, the use of the auxiliary verb “will” could be seen as indicative of a future tense. "I will go to the store" is widely accepted as an expression of future action and could, therefore, be seen as evidence supporting the UT approach's view of future tense. However, this too could be viewed as supporting the modal tense approach, as “will” could be seen as a modal auxiliary that expresses probability and certainty.
The theoretical approaches to tense in English have significant implications for everyday language use. Language users must navigate the complexities of tense, often relying on cues from context, syntax, and intonation to make sense of a sentence’s temporal structure. A speaker using the Aspectual Tense approach might use the present progressive to signal a future event, while a UT approach speaker might use the auxiliary verb “will”. Meanwhile, a speaker using the modal approach might use would, could, or "might" to express the likelihood of a future event. In this sense, the understanding of tense is not only driven by the grammatical structure; it is also dependent on the speaker’s perspective and their understanding of the context in which the language is being used.
In conclusion, the theoretical approaches to tense in English are numerous and varied. The Aspectual, UT, and Modal approach all have different views on the existence and definition of future tense in the English language. The evidence from the surface and deep structures of English provides support for each approach, highlighting the complexities of understanding and using tense in everyday language. Ultimately, the use of the different approaches to tense in English offers rich opportunities for nuanced expression and interpretation, while also presenting challenges for linguistic clarity and mutual understanding.
