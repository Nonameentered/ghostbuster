Plutarch was a Greek philosopher and biographer who lived in the first and second centuries AD. He is known for his works on the lives of famous figures in ancient history, as well as his writings on religion and philosophy. One of his most famous works is his retelling of the story of Osiris, one of the most important figures in Egyptian mythology. In this essay, we will examine Plutarch's version of the Osiris myth, compare it to the Egyptian sources, and consider whether or not it is a useful tool or a damaging influence on the study of Egyptian mythology.
The Osiris myth is one of the most important and complex stories in Egyptian mythology. It tells the story of Osiris, the god of the afterlife, who is murdered by his jealous brother Set, the god of chaos. Osiris' body is cut into pieces and scattered throughout Egypt, but his wife, Isis, gathers his parts and restores him to life. Osiris then becomes the ruler of the afterlife and judge of the dead.
Plutarch's version of the Osiris myth is found in his work, "On Isis and Osiris," which was written around the year 100 AD. Plutarch's retelling of the myth is significantly different from the Egyptian sources in several ways. For example, Plutarch emphasizes the moral and philosophical themes of the story, rather than the religious and magical aspects. He also introduces Greek philosophical concepts, such as the idea of the soul and the afterlife, which were not present in the original Egyptian myth.
One of the most significant differences between Plutarch's version and the Egyptian sources is the portrayal of Osiris himself. In the Egyptian myth, Osiris is a god who is killed and resurrected, and who serves as a symbol of renewal and regeneration. In Plutarch's version, however, Osiris is portrayed as a philosopher and teacher who travels the world, spreading his wisdom and knowledge. Plutarch portrays Osiris as a figure who embodies Greek philosophical ideals, such as the pursuit of knowledge and the importance of wisdom.
Another difference between Plutarch's version and the Egyptian sources is the portrayal of Isis. In the Egyptian myth, Isis is a powerful goddess who uses her magical abilities to resurrect Osiris and defeat Set. In Plutarch's version, however, Isis is portrayed as a philosopher in her own right, who teaches alongside Osiris and shares his wisdom. Plutarch emphasizes the intellectual partnership between Isis and Osiris, rather than their magical abilities.
Despite these differences, Plutarch's version of the Osiris myth does bear some similarities to the Egyptian sources. For example, he retains the basic plot of the story, including the murder of Osiris, the scattering of his body parts, and the restoration of his life by Isis. He also preserves many of the key symbols and images from the original myth, such as the Ankh, the symbol of life, and the crook and flail, which represent royal power.
So, is Plutarch's version of the Osiris myth a useful tool or a damaging influence on the study of Egyptian mythology? On the one hand, Plutarch's retelling of the story provides valuable insights into the way that Greeks viewed Egyptian religion and mythology. His emphasis on the philosophical and moral themes of the story, as well as his use of Greek concepts and ideas, can help us to better understand the cultural context in which the myth was retold and reinterpreted.
On the other hand, Plutarch's version of the Osiris myth can also be seen as damaging to the study of Egyptian mythology. By imposing Greek philosophical concepts onto the story, Plutarch risks distorting and erasing important aspects of the original myth. He also runs the risk of presenting a biased and culturally specific interpretation of the story, rather than allowing the Egyptian sources to speak for themselves.
In conclusion, Plutarch's retelling of the Osiris myth is an interesting and valuable contribution to the study of Egyptian mythology. While it differs significantly from the original Egyptian sources in some key ways, it also contains important insights into the way that the story was interpreted and reinterpreted by later cultures. Ultimately, whether or not Plutarch's version is a useful tool or a damaging influence on the study of Egyptian mythology depends on how it is read and interpreted. If we approach it with an open mind and a critical eye, we can gain new perspectives on an ancient and complex myth, while also acknowledging its historical and cultural context.
