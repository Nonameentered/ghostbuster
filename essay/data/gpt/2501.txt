The most useful way-finding tasks for the Armstrong Siddeley Building would be to provide clear and concise signage throughout the building. Our usability test analysis revealed that participants struggled to find their way around the building due to the lack of way-finding signage. Additionally, adding color-coded floors and walls would also be beneficial as it creates a visual cue for navigation. The addition of interactive digital maps or kiosks in high-traffic areas would help visitors easily locate their desired destination. Lastly, providing a directory with a clear map and directory of all the locations in the building would add an extra layer of convenience for visitors. Overall, implementing these way-finding solutions will improve user experience and increase efficiency in navigating the Armstrong Siddeley Building.
