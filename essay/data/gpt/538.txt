Theatre is an art form that speaks to the very essence of humanity. It has the power to move people, to inspire them, to reveal truths and to provide a transformative experience that can stay with an individual for a lifetime. In the early 1960s, the theatre was rapidly changing with the rise of new social and political movements and the advent of new technologies. There was a growing sense that theatre had become too commercialized and had lost its connection to its audience. It was at this time that the Polish theatre director, Jerzy Grotowski, developed his approach to theatre, which he called "poor theatre." Through his work, Grotowski sought to reclaim the essence of theatre and to connect it to the everyday lives of its audience. This essay will examine what is meant by "poor theatre" and how Grotowski's approach to theatre resulted in this practice gaining its unique title.
The term "poor theatre" can be confusing for those who are not familiar with Grotowski's work. At first glance, it may seem to suggest that the theatre is impoverished in some way or that it lacks the resources necessary to create compelling productions. However, this is not the case. Poor theatre is not about poverty or lack of resources. Instead, it is a term that refers to a particular approach to theatre that emphasizes the performer and the audience over the production elements such as costumes, sets, and lighting.
According to Grotowski, poor theatre is a form of performance that is stripped down to its bare essentials. It is about removing all of the distractions that can interfere with the connection between the performer and the audience. As he explained in his book, "Towards a Poor Theatre," "Theatre is a value, not because it is a way of making a living, but because it is a way of experiencing life and expressing it."
In Grotowski's view, traditional theatre had become too focused on spectacle. The emphasis was on elaborate sets, costumes, and lighting, and the performers were often overshadowed by these production elements. This, in turn, created a distance between the performer and the audience, making it difficult for the audience to connect with the performance on an emotional level.
To address this issue, Grotowski developed an approach to theatre that emphasized the performer and the audience. In his view, the performer was the central focus of the production, and everything else was secondary. He believed that the performer had the power to create a transformative experience for the audience through their performance.
Grotowski's approach to theatre emphasized the importance of training and discipline for performers. He believed that performers needed to be fully committed to their craft and to develop a deep understanding of their bodies, their voices, and their emotions. This training was designed to help performers develop a heightened sensitivity to their own bodies, as well as to the emotions and reactions of their audience.
One of the key elements of Grotowski's approach to theatre was the use of improvisation. He believed that improvisation was an essential tool for performers, as it allowed them to be fully present in the moment and to respond to the needs of the audience. Improvisation also allowed performers to explore new and unexpected possibilities within the performance.
Grotowski's approach to theatre was also characterized by a focus on ritual and ceremony. He believed that theatre had the power to transform individuals and to connect them to something greater than themselves. In his view, theatre could be a transformative experience that could help individuals to connect with their spiritual and emotional selves.
Grotowski's approach to theatre was revolutionary in its time and had a profound influence on the course of theatre history. Through his work, Grotowski sought to reconnect theatre to its roots and to create a more intimate connection between the audience and the performer. He believed that theatre had the power to change lives and to bring about social and political change.
In conclusion, the term "poor theatre" refers to a particular approach to theatre that emphasizes the performer and the audience over production elements. Jerzy Grotowski's approach to theatre sought to strip theatre down to its bare essentials and to create a more intimate connection between the performer and the audience. He believed that theatre had the power to transform individuals and to bring about social and political change. Through his work, Grotowski has had a profound influence on the course of theatre history and has helped to shape the way that we think about theatre today.
