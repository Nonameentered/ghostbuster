Introduction
Judicial review is the process by which courts review and determine the constitutionality of government actions or laws. The availability and utility of judicial review have been contentious issues in legal and political discourse for many years. On the one hand, critics argue that judicial review infringes on the policymaking powers of elected representatives and undermines the principles of democracy. On the other hand, supporters believe that judicial review is essential for protecting individual rights and ensuring that government actions and laws adhere to the constitution.
In this essay, we will explore the contentious issues surrounding the availability and utility of judicial review, and how they can be applied to a hypothetical case involving a school student's expulsion for drug use. We will examine the arguments for and against judicial review and how they apply to the particular case.
Controversies surrounding the availability and utility of judicial review
One of the main controversies surrounding judicial review is the question of who should have the power to interpret the Constitution. Critics argue that the power to interpret the Constitution should be in the hands of elected representatives rather than judges. They claim that when judges use the Constitution to strike down laws or actions of the executive or legislative branches, they are in effect substituting their own policy preferences for those of the elected branches. Moreover, they argue that judges are not accountable to the public and that judicial review undermines the principles of democracy.
On the other hand, supporters of judicial review argue that it is necessary to ensure that the government operates within the limits set by the Constitution. They contend that without judicial review, the government could violate individual rights and trample on the Constitution with impunity. Moreover, they argue that the judiciary is uniquely qualified to interpret the Constitution and that judicial review is an essential tool for enforcing the Constitution's guarantees.
Another controversy surrounding judicial review is whether courts should defer to the decisions of elected officials or strike down their actions. The principle of deference suggests that courts should defer to the decisions of elected officials unless there is a clear and compelling reason to intervene. Critics of judicial review argue that courts should defer to the other branches of government and that judicial intervention should be a last resort.
In contrast, supporters of judicial review argue that courts must be willing to strike down government actions or laws that violate the Constitution. They contend that the judiciary has a duty to enforce the Constitution and protect individual rights, even when doing so means overruling the actions of elected officials. Moreover, they argue that the judiciary is uniquely suited to protect the rights of minorities and other marginalized groups who may not have a voice in the political process.
A hypothetical case involving a school student's expulsion for drug use
To illustrate the contentious issues surrounding judicial review, consider a hypothetical case involving a school student who has been expelled for drug use. The student, a high school senior, was caught smoking marijuana during school hours. The school has a zero-tolerance policy for drug use, and the student has been expelled for violating the policy.
The students and their parents would most likely challenge the expulsion on the grounds that it violates their constitutional rights. They may argue that the school's zero-tolerance policy is too harsh and that the student's expulsion is disproportionate to the offense. They may also argue that the policy violates the student's right to privacy and due process.
In this case, the contentious issues surrounding judicial review come into play. Critics of judicial review may argue that the judiciary should defer to the school's decision to expel the student. They may contend that the school's policy is reasonable and that the student was aware of the consequences of violating it. Moreover, they may argue that the student's constitutional rights were not violated because the school has the authority to make rules that promote safety and discipline.
In contrast, supporters of judicial review may argue that the student's expulsion violates their constitutional rights. They may contend that the school's zero-tolerance policy is too harsh and that the student's expulsion is disproportionate to the offense. Moreover, they may argue that the policy violates the student's right to privacy and due process. They may also argue that the school's policy is in conflict with applicable state or federal laws.
Conclusion
Judicial review is a contentious issue that has sparked debate among legal and political thinkers for many years. Critics of judicial review argue that it infringes on the policymaking powers of elected representatives and undermines the principles of democracy. On the other hand, supporters argue that judicial review is essential for protecting individual rights and ensuring that government actions and laws adhere to the Constitution. The student's hypothetical case illustrates how these competing views can interact in the context of a specific legal dispute. Ultimately, the proper resolution of such a dispute will depend on a careful analysis of the facts, the law, and the Constitution, and a determination of whether the school's actions were constitutional or not.
