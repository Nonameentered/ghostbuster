The cities have been portrayed in poetry in different ways and embody different meanings for various poets. In the modernist period, poets such as T.S. Eliot and Gerard Manley Hopkins portrayed cities in their poems, and their works have been widely acknowledged for their innovation, pioneering style and their unique way of reflecting contemporary culture. Both poets were known for their use of stylistic features such as repetition, alliteration, and metaphor. In this essay, I will compare and contrast their depiction of cities and the stylistic features they used in their respective works.
First, let us examine Eliot's depiction of cities. Eliot was known for his bleak and cynical portrayal of cities, which he used to represent the moral decay of society. In his famous poem "The Waste Land," Eliot portrays the city as a barren wasteland that has lost its vitality and energy. The city, according to Eliot, is a symbol of spiritual emptiness and decay. He also presents the city as a labyrinth with no escape, where people become lost and disoriented.
On the contrast, Hopkins depicts cities as places of energy, industry, and human creativity. Unlike Eliot, he saw cities as a place for discovery, invention and progress. In his poem "Pied Beauty," Hopkins describes the city in terms of its diversity and variety. He acknowledges the unique beauty that resides in manmade products and the diverse people living in the modern city.
Despite their different perspectives in their depiction of cities, both poets use stylistic devices such as repetition, alliteration, and metaphor to create vivid imagery in their poetry. Hopkins frequently uses alliteration and repetition to emphasise the sound and rhythm of words. In his poem "Pied Beauty," he uses alliteration to draw attention to the complexity of the city, such as the phrase “swift, slow; sweet, sour, adazzle, dim.” In another instance, he uses repetition to emphasise the diversity of the city's beauty – “All things counter, original, spare, strange”. The use of alliteration and repetition creates a musical and memorable effect on the reader.
Similarly, Eliot uses similar stylistic devices to create a sense of fragmentation and disunity that is reflective of his depiction of the city. In "The Waste Land," Eliot uses repetition to emphasise the hollowness of modern life, “I will show you fear in a handful of dust.” Additionally, Eliot employs metaphors to present his vision of the city as a wasteland and barren place. In his poem, he vividly describes how the modern city is a place of despair, with images of “dead trees” and “burned-out ends of smoky days.” Through these metaphors, Eliot illustrates his pessimistic view of the city as a place where dreams die, and hope is extinguished.
Eliot also utilises fragmented lines in his poetry to capture the chaos and confusion of the city. This technique reflects the disintegration of modern social structures. The fragmented lines in "The Waste Land," mirrors the disjointedness of modern urban life, which has produced a depersonalised and fragmented society. This technique ultimately emphasises Eliot's view that the modern city has reshaped human consciousness, resulting in a spiritual emptiness and moral decay.
In contrast, Hopkins uses a more structured and formal rhythm in his poems. This rhythm reflects his appreciation of nature's orderliness and beauty. In "The Windhover," Hopkins masterfully employs sprung rhythm, a style that he had popularised himself. This form creates an effect of fluidity in the composition, representing the nimble nature of the hawk he is describing, while also capturing the sense of awe that the speaker is feeling.
Overall, while both poets utilise stylistic devices to create vivid imagery of cities, their styles of depicting and conceptualising the city are diametrically opposed. Hopkins employs alliteration, repetition, and metaphors to convey positive aspects of urban life, such as diversity, novelty, and creativity. Eliot, on the other hand, uses this same stylistic technique to present cities as places of chaos, uncertainty, and moral decay.
In conclusion, T.S Eliot and Hopkins were both prominent modernist poets, and their different perspectives of the cities were shown through their use of stylistic devices such as repetition, alliteration and metaphor. Eliot portrayed cities as decadent, fragmented, and spiritually void, while Hopkins depicted cities as places of invention, creativity, and dynamic energy. The use of similar stylistic features enabled both poets to create vivid and impressive imagery in their poetry. Thus, in comparing and contrasting these two poets' works, it is evident that despite utilizing some similar stylistic techniques, their respective depictions of cities reflected polar opposites ends of modernist experiments.
