Introduction:
Torque is an important parameter to measure when it comes to understanding the behavior of structures. Especially in the case of hollow steel shafts, understanding the torque applied is crucial for applications ranging from aerospace engineering to automobile engineering. To measure the torque applied on the hollow steel shaft, a strain gauge based Wheatstone bridge circuit is often used. This essay will discuss the design of such a system for measuring the torque applied to a hollow steel shaft using strain gauges and a Wheatstone bridge circuit.
Design of Strain Gauge based Wheatstone Bridge Circuit:
When it comes to measuring torque, strain gauges play a crucial role. Strain gauges are sensors that can convert the mechanical deformation of a structure into an electrical signal. Strain gauges work based on the principle of changing resistance with respect to the applied strain. The Wheatstone bridge circuit is used to amplify the small changes in resistance in the strain gauge so that the signal can be accurately measured. Therefore, to measure the torque applied to a hollow steel shaft, strain gauges will be attached to the surface of the hollow steel shaft, and the changes in resistance will be measured using a Wheatstone bridge circuit.
Effects of Temperature Changes and Axial/Bending Forces:
The system must be designed in such a way that it takes into account the various environmental factors that can impact the readings. Temperature changes can significantly affect the readings because the strain gauges can exhibit changes in resistance with temperature. Therefore, temperature compensation must be included as part of the design. The strain gauge based Wheatstone bridge circuit should be equipped with a temperature compensation circuit so that the readings that are taken will be accurate, regardless of the temperature changes. Axial and bending forces can also impact the readings. However, in the case of a hollow steel shaft, axial and bending forces are not expected to cause significant variations in the readings. This is because the strain gauge sensors will be placed on the surface of the hollow steel shaft, and any axial or bending forces will be transmitted through the cross-sectional area of the shaft, which the strain gauges are insensitive to.
Calibration and Data Presentation Methods:
To calibrate the system, measurement values for the torque applied will be taken using a torque wrench or other proven method of applying torque to the hollow steel shaft. The readings from the strain gauges will be recorded at different torque values applied and a calibration curve will be created. The calibration curve will be used to convert the readings from the strain gauge-based Wheatstone bridge circuit into meaningful torque values that can be used to analyze the performance of the structure.
Data from the strain gauge based Wheatstone bridge circuit will be collected and analyzed using data acquisition software. The software will convert the raw data from the Wheatstone bridge circuit to the meaningful torque values using the calibration curve created earlier. The data can be presented in different formats, such as a graph or table, to enable easy analysis and understanding.
Equations and Complete System Diagram:
The Wheatstone bridge circuit is made up of four resistance sensors, two of which act as the strain gauges. The resistance of the strain gauges changes as deformation happens in the shaft due to the torque applied. In the case of a 45-degree strain gauge pattern (shown below), the relationship between the angle of deformation and the resistance changes is given by:
θ = ΔR/R * 4/μ
Where θ is the angle of deformation, ΔR is the change in resistance of the strain gauge, R is the resistance of the strain gauge, and μ is the Poisson’s ratio of the material of the shaft.
The complete system diagram for the proposed design is as shown below:
 
The strain gauge-based Wheatstone bridge circuit is connected to a data acquisition system, which collects and analyzes the data. The temperature compensation circuit is included in the design, and the calibration curve that is generated from the calibration process is stored in the data acquisition system.
Conclusion: 
In conclusion, the design of a system for measuring the torque applied to a hollow steel shaft using strain gauges and a Wheatstone bridge circuit has been discussed. The effects of temperature changes and axial/bending forces have been considered, as well as the calibration process and data presentation methods. The system diagram and equations necessary for the design have also been presented. With this design, researchers and technicians will be able to accurately measure the torque applied on a hollow steel shaft and thus optimize its performance.
