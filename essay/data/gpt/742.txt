Swing Time, released in 1936, is often regarded as one of the best musicals ever made. In the film, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers lead the cast, with Astaire as a dancer and Rogers as a dancer and singer. Swing Time is widely regarded as a turning point in the Rogers and Astaire film cycle for several reasons, including its groundbreaking dance choreography, improved storytelling, and a more nuanced portrayal of contemporary social issues. In this essay, I will discuss the argument for Swing Time being a turning point in the Rogers and Astaire film cycle and the evidence that supports this argument.
Firstly, Swing Time is a turning point in the film cycle because of its groundbreaking dance choreography. The film is known for its iconic dance numbers, including "Pick Yourself Up," "The Way You Look Tonight," and "Never Gonna Dance." These dance numbers showcase Astaire and Rogers' exceptional performance skills and demonstrate the evolution of dance choreography. Astaire's choreography is considered more complex and intricate than in his previous films, particularly in the dance number "Bojangles of Harlem," which astutely fuses elements of tap and ballet. In addition, the dance numbers in Swing Time are longer and more elaborate than in previous Rogers and Astaire films, which allowed the dancers to showcase their talent better. In short, the dance choreography in Swing Time set the standard for future musicals and made it a turning point in the Rogers and Astaire film cycle.
Secondly, Swing Time is unique in terms of story development. Unlike the Rogers and Astaire films that came before it, Swing Time has a stronger, more compelling storyline. The film's primary focus is on the romantic relationship between Astaire and Rogers. The plot revolves around Astaire's attempts to impress the love of his life using dance as he makes a promise to her that he will return from New York a wealthy man who isn't afraid of commitment. Although this may sound like a typical rom-com storyline, the script is sharp, witty and well-calibrated, and it's complemented by the music. The fact that the plot isn't just revolving around the dance routine elevates the movie to a more modern and sophisticated level, accumulating a wider audience and consolidating Swing Time as a turning point of the Rogers and Astaire film cycle.
Finally, Swing Time tackles more contemporary social issues, bringing another dimension that audiences had never seen before. The film touches on subjects such as class, gender, race discrimination, and social mobility. In particular, the film has a scene where Astaire accidentally ends up in a dance studio run by a black man, played by the excellent and charismatic actor, the legendary Bill Robinson. Robinson's character teaches Astaire how to dance properly, blurring racial lines in the process. Moreover, all the bad characters of the movie have strong accents (Chicago or Brooklyn), which suggest they belong to the lower classes, differing from Astaireâ€™s character who is from an affluent background. The film used these scenes to provide a profound, yet insightful commentary on the cultural changes occurring during the 1930s.
In conclusion, Swing Time is one of the most significant films in the Rogers and Astaire film cycle. It's a film that features impressive dance choreography, improved storytelling, and more nuanced portrayal of social issues. The dance numbers became more dynamic and imaginative, the storyline began focusing on other subjects than just pure romance, and the film addresses the most pressing issues of the era. This extraordinary combination provided a high-quality movie that consolidated Swing Time as a turning point in the remaining of the cycle and further codified Rogers and Astaire as two of the greatest performers in the history of cinema. This innovative film continues to capture the hearts of audiences worldwide even over 80 years later.
