Alcoholism is a major public health concern that affects millions of people worldwide. According to statistics, over 14 million adults in the United States have alcohol-use disorder, and around 88,000 people die annually due to alcohol-related causes, including accidents, liver disease, and cancer. While it is known that alcohol can cause short-term effects such as slurred speech and impaired balance, it is also important to understand how alcohol affects the brain in the long run. Psychiatric nurses play a critical role in assisting patients with alcohol-use disorder by providing evidence-based interventions and educating them about the effects of alcohol on the brain.
A recent research published in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry, shows that alcohol use can have results like seizures, dementia, depression, and anxiety disorder. Additionally, alcohol consumption can lead to long-term alterations in brain structure, grey matter density, and loss of brain volume, which can have serious consequences such as memory deficits, cognitive impairment, and reduced executive functioning.
The first effect of alcohol on the brain is impairment of neurotransmitter function. Alcohol suppresses neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA, leading to an imbalance in the excitation and inhibition of neurons. In other words, alcohol reduces the activity of glutamate, which transmits signals throughout the brain, and enhances the activity of GABA, which is inhibitory.
The second effect of alcohol on the brain is damage to the frontal lobe, the part of the brain responsible for executive functions such as decision making, problem-solving, and planning. Chronic alcohol use can lead to the death of frontal lobe cells, resulting in impaired judgment, decreased attention span, and reduced ability to process information efficiently.
The third effect of alcohol on the brain is the disruption of the hippocampus, a part of the brain responsible for memory processing. Alcohol affects the hippocampus by slowing down the formation and retrieval of memories and reducing the hippocampal volume. This explains why people who drink excessively often experience blackouts and memory loss, as well as other symptoms such as hallucinations and delirium tremens.
The fourth effect of alcohol on the brain is the potential for aversion to neurotransmitter systems of the brain that affect mood regulation, causing anxiety and depression. It may also lead to the development of co-occurring disorders, such as anxiety and depressive disorders, and treatment complications.
Understanding the effects of alcohol on the brain is of particular importance to psychiatric nurses who work with patients who have alcohol-use disorder. Psychiatric nurses should utilize their specialized knowledge of mental health and addictions to offer nursing diagnoses that reflect the patient's needs and level of functioning. Using appreciative inquiry and strengths-based methods would support the patient's strengths that he or she would need to support their journey to recovery. The nursing plan must also elucidate the patient's behaviors, thoughts, and feelings as they relate to their drug or alcohol use. It helps to identify triggers, plan medication management, and prepare for appropriate counseling.
Given the complexity of alcohol-use disorder, a multidisciplinary treatment approach is often recommended. A psychiatric nurse's role includes collaborating with the physician and rehabilitation facilities to develop and implement treatment plans that incorporate psychopharmacological interventions, counseling therapies, and educational interventions. They must also keep track of drug interactions and other complications that arise during the course of treatment, offer family-based counseling, and assist patients in developing new coping mechanisms. The nurse must also provide referrals to community-based organizations and support groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, and encourage family support to ensure continuous care provision.
In conclusion, alcohol-use disorder is a pervasive public health concern that has significant effects on the brain. Psychiatric nurses play a critical role in assisting patients with alcohol-use disorder by providing evidence-based interventions and educating them about the effects of alcohol on the brain. Understanding the effects of alcohol on the brain is especially critical to psychiatric nurses who work with patients who have alcohol-use disorder. The nursing plan must explicate the patient's behaviors, thoughts, and feelings as they relate to their drug or alcohol use. While a multidisciplinary treatment approach is often necessary, the psychiatric nurse should be the primary point of contact and ensure that patients receive comprehensive, coordinated care. With appropriate mental health care and support, individuals struggling with alcohol-use disorder can go on to lead healthy and fulfilling lives.
