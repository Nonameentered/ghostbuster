Capital punishment, which is the government's practice of taking a convicted criminal's life as a punishment for their crimes, is one of the most controversial issues in the history of criminal justice. While some individuals view it as a necessary deterrent towards crime, others consider it to be a barbaric and inhumane practice that ultimately serves no greater purpose. On a global scale, some countries have abolished capital punishment, in what are referred to as abolitionist states, while others have retained the practice, in what are referred to as retentionist states. In this essay, we will explore the arguments for reinstating capital punishment in abolitionist states and maintaining it in retentionist states.
In retentionist states, proponents of capital punishment argue that it serves as a necessary deterrent towards crime, especially for heinous crimes such as murder or aggravated sexual assault. Many argue that it sends a strong message to potential criminals that there are consequences to their actions, which may dissuade them from committing such crimes. In addition, capital punishment is often viewed as a just response to heinous acts that afford no possible rehabilitation or redemption. To supporters, capital punishment is a moral issue, and they firmly believe that those who have taken another’s life should face a similar fate.
In contrast, opponents of capital punishment argue that it does not serve as a deterrent for crime. They argue that potential criminals are unlikely to be dissuaded by the existence of capital punishment, as it is a practice that is rarely carried out and is not often the first consideration when committing a crime. Moreover, they argue that, in practice, capital punishment is often discriminatory and disproportionately affects marginalized groups such as the poor, people of color, and those with mental health disorders.
In addition to the moral and ethical arguments surrounding capital punishment, there are also practical considerations that can affect the decision to either retain or abolish capital punishment. For instance, retentionist states often argue that the death penalty is necessary to keep prisons from being overcrowded, especially considering the high cost of long-term incarceration. In addition, execution provides a sense of closure to victims’ families, which is regarded as valuable for their healing and grieving processes.
On the other hand, abolitionist states primarily argue that capital punishment is inhumane, as it constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. Additionally, abolitionists refute the idea that capital punishment acts as a deterrent towards crime, four reasons, including the rarity of capital punishment, its unpredictability and unfairness, and the lack of any correlation between the practice and crime rates. Abolitionist perspectives often regard the death penalty as an archaic practice that lacks any basis in modern ideals of justice and human rights.
Abolitionists also argue that the risk of executing an innocent person is high, even in states where a great deal of effort goes into ensuring the accuracy of convictions. For example, the Innocence Project, a group dedicated to exonerating wrongfully convicted individuals, has already freed over 330 people due to DNA evidence. If the death penalty was applied to all those cleared by the project, it would have resulted in over 330 executions of innocent people; this possibility is unacceptable, making capital punishment unethical and incompatible with a just legal system.
Another consideration that abolitionists take into account when arguing against capital punishment is the often lengthy, expensive, and drawn-out legal process, which can drag on for several years or even decades. This process can leave victims’ families and loved ones in a state of perpetual uncertainty and psychological distress. Often so-called death row institutions are criticized for placing individuals in a specific terror known as the ultimate punishment, delaying the execution indefinitely by exhausting all appeals.
Conversely, those in favor of reinstating capital punishment in abolitionist states typically argue that it serves as a necessary counterbalance for an overly lenient legal system. Many argue that the absence of the death penalty only encourages criminals to commit heinous acts because they know they are unlikely to receive the harshest punishment possible. Reinstatement supporters argue that the availability of the death penalty can provide a potent psychological deterrent to would-be criminals, thereby reducing crime rates and protecting society.
Moreover, reinstating capital punishment is often viewed as symbolically necessary. It indicates that society will not tolerate heinous crimes, and ethical standards will serve as a clear demarcation between what is acceptable and what is not. Therefore, the death penalty serves as a retribution for a criminal’s actions, thereby lending an added sense of authority to the justice system.
Ultimately, whether one supports or opposes capital punishment, it is a highly complex and multifaceted issue that warrants a thorough and nuanced examination. While both sides argue with valid concerns, it is essential to determine the ethical and moral implications of the practice and weigh those against the practical considerations such as the cost, its effectiveness, and its impact on society at large. Through a better understanding of both sides, we can continue to advance and perfect our legal justice system and, to an extent, contribute to protecting society from crime and abuse.
