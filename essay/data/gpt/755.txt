An experiment was carried out in the laboratory to determine the moment of inertia of three given disks of different sizes. The aim of this experiment was to calculate how easily the disks would rotate about their center points. This experiment has great significance in physics as it can help in understanding the dynamics of rotational motion.
The team conducting this experiment used various methods to calculate the moment of inertia of the three disks. First, they measured the mass and radius of each disk using a digital scale and a Vernier caliper. They then used a string and a weight to measure the time period of oscillation for each disk about its center. By using the equations of motion, they were able to calculate the moment of inertia of each disk.
The formula used to calculate the moment of inertia for a disc is I = (1/2)mr^2. Where ‘m’ is the mass and ‘r’ is the radius of the disc. This formula implies that the moment of inertia of the disc is directly proportional to its mass and the square of its radius. Therefore, the greater the mass and radius of the disc, the greater its moment of inertia will be.
In order to ensure the accuracy of the experiment, several precautions were taken. Firstly, the disks were thoroughly cleaned and dried before the experiment. Any dirt, grease, or moisture on the surface of the disks could have affected the moment of inertia. Secondly, the Vernier caliper and digital scale were calibrated before any measurements were taken. All the calculations and formulae were double-checked to avoid any mathematical errors. Thirdly, the team ensured that the string they used to suspend the discs was taut and that the weight was stable and constant throughout all the measurements. Any variation in the tension of the string or the weight of the weight would have altered the time period of oscillation and, therefore, the moment of inertia.
Another key precaution that was taken during the experiment was to ensure that the disks were rotated around their central axis only. This helped to eliminate any effect of wobbling or tilting of the disk, which could distort the true value of the moment of inertia. To eliminate this error, the team ensured that the string was attached to the center of each disk, and the disks were suspended symmetrically. Additionally, they made sure that the disks were not touching each other or any other object that could affect their motion.
In conclusion, the aim of the experiment carried out in the laboratory was to determine the moment of inertia of three given disks of different sizes. To calculate the moment of inertia, the mass and radius of each disk were measured, and the time period of oscillation was recorded. The moment of inertia was then calculated using the formula I = (1/2)mr^2. In order to ensure the accuracy of the experiment, various precautions were taken. These included cleaning and drying the disks thoroughly, calibrating all measuring devices, ensuring that the string and weight were stable, and rotating the disks around their central axis only. By taking these measures, the team was able to accurately determine the moment of inertia of each disk, which can be used to understand the dynamics of rotational motion better. The experiment had significant implications in physics and will help researchers delve further into the field.
