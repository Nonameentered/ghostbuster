A smart home system refers to a network of interconnected electronic devices designed to facilitate the automation of various household tasks. For elderly people, this system has immense benefits, including safety, convenience, and improved quality of life. Generally, two main sensors are used in smart home systems - motion sensors and entry sensors. These sensors are an essential component of the smart home system as they help to monitor the activities of the elderly and alert caregivers or healthcare providers to any inconsistencies in their daily routines. 
The adoption of an intensive smart home system over an extensive one was a strategic decision in providing round-the-clock monitoring within a confined space rather than spreading resources thinly over a large area. An extensive system would not have sufficient sensing capabilities and mechanisms to monitor the elderly comprehensively. An extensive system would be more appropriate for large residential homes, colleges, or commercial premises. Therefore, an intensive smart home system is more suitable for elderly people.
The integration of multiple sensors into a single intensive smart home system is essential in improving the ability of the processing unit to draw accurate conclusions based on the information received. The processing unit, which can either be a hub or a server, will collect data from sensors and employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning algorithms to analyze and classify the data. The collected data is then stored in a database, and analytics are applied to generate statistical trends and patterns for future predictions. The software module of the smart home system has three main sections - the monitoring section, the control section, and the user interface section.
The monitoring section is responsible for collecting data from the various sensors and monitoring the activities of the elderly. This section also stores data to be processed by the control and user interface sections later on. In the control section, the software processes the data collected from the monitoring section and makes decisions based on the algorithms and rules programmed into it. For instance, if the elderly person's motion sensor does not detect movement during the day, the system sends a notification alert to the caregiver or healthcare provider. Finally, the user interface section provides a means through which the elderly person interacts with the system. 
The smart home system's automation capabilities benefit elderly people in several ways, such as improving safety, optimizing care costs, and improving quality of life. For example, using sensors to monitor the elderly's movement and routines within the house enables caregivers or healthcare providers to know if something is wrong. If, for instance, the elderly person has not moved for a long time, the sensor will alert the caregiver or healthcare provider who can then check on them, thereby preventing falls or accidents. In a case of an emergency, the system can also be programmed to alert emergency services. 
Another benefit is improved quality of life, where elderly people can live independently and feel secure in their homes. With the smart home system, they no longer have to depend on others to perform mundane tasks like turning on the lights or adjusting room temperatures. Smart home systems can be integrated with voice-activated systems like Alexa or Google Home, allowing the elderly to control the house devices with their voice. This considerably simplifies their daily routine. 
The smart home system also benefits caregivers and healthcare providers. It saves time, cost, and provides a comfort level of knowing that their elderly patients are being cared for and monitored remotely. The system allows providers to manage multiple elderly patients simultaneously, reducing care costs and time. This management allows healthcare providers to streamline their operations and enables them to offer comprehensive care to their patients with reduced costs. Institutions can also integrate the system into their medical records, thereby facilitating data collection, storage, and analytics. 
The two main sensors used in the smart home system are motion sensors and entry sensors. Motion sensors are designed to detect movement and automatically switch on/off light fixtures that illuminate the path. Motion sensors are placed in corridors, bedrooms, and other common areas accessible to the elderly person. This helps in avoiding falls or accidents that may occur due to poor lighting. Entry sensors are placed on doors or entrances and are triggered when someone passes through the doorway. These sensors are essential in tracking the movements of the elderly person, especially if the caregiver or healthcare provider wants to know whether they are in or out of the house. 
In conclusion, smart home systems are designed to improve the quality of life for elderly people. The automation capabilities provide improved safety, cost savings, and improved quality of life for the elderly. The two main sensors used in the smart home system, motion sensors, and entry sensors, are essential in monitoring the activities of the elderly and alerting caregivers or healthcare providers of any inconsistencies in their daily routines. Smart home systems benefit caregivers and healthcare providers by streamlining operations and enabling them to offer comprehensive care to their patients with reduced costs. Furthermore, the smart home system's adoption of an intensive system over an extensive system is strategic as it enables the system to provide around-the-clock monitoring within a confined space, improving the system's sensing capabilities and mechanisms to monitor the elderly comprehensively.
