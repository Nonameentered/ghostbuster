The death of a loved one can be one of the most painful and devastating experiences a person can endure. It can feel like the world is ending, like everything that was once good and beautiful has been destroyed. In the face of such loss, many people turn to poetry to express their grief and find solace. Two poets who have dealt with the theme of grief in their work are Douglas Dunn, in his poem 'The Kaleidoscope', and Lavinia Greenlaw, in 'Underworld'. Both poets use language and form to explore the theme of grief, but they do so in very different ways. This essay will compare and contrast these two poems, looking at the ways they deal with grief in terms of form, language, and cultural references.
First and foremost, it is important to note that both 'The Kaleidoscope' and 'Underworld' deal with grief in their own unique ways. In 'The Kaleidoscope', Dunn describes the aftermath of his wife's death and how he struggles to cope with the absence of her presence in his life. The poem is structured like a traditional elegy, with four stanzas of three lines each. Each stanza is a separate thought, with a different perspective on the theme of grief. In contrast, 'Underworld' is a much longer and more complex poem, which explores different aspects of grief through a series of interconnected memories and images.
One way that the two poems differ is in their use of language. 'The Kaleidoscope' is a very spare, understated poem, which conveys the raw intensity of the speaker's grief through short, simple statements. Dunn's language is direct and unadorned, with few metaphors or allusions. In contrast, Greenlaw's language is rich and complex, with many allusions and references. She uses a variety of poetic devices, such as repetition, imagery and metaphor to create a multi-layered and nuanced portrayal of grief. For example, in the opening lines of 'Underworld', Greenlaw writes "Memory is white noise: a piano/playing in another room, a crane in the sky". Here, she uses metaphor to suggest that grief is a form of static or background noise, which is always present but not always noticed. She also uses the image of a crane to evoke the feeling of being lost or disorientated, since cranes are often used to navigate through complex cityscapes.
Another way that the two poems differ is in their use of myths and cultural references. In 'The Kaleidoscope', Dunn does not use any cultural references or myths directly. However, he does allude to the idea of a "world without end" in the final stanza, which suggests that he is looking for some kind of eternal truth or comfort in the face of his wife's death. In contrast, 'Underworld' is full of references to Greek mythology, and in particular to the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. Greenlaw uses this myth to explore different aspects of grief, such as the idea of loss and longing, the power of art to console, and the possible futility of seeking to bring the dead back to life. For example, in one section of the poem, Greenlaw writes "All through the night/Orpheus walked among the trees" to suggest that the speaker is wandering aimlessly through the landscape of her grief, searching for some kind of meaning or understanding.
Finally, the two poems differ in their attitudes towards grief and mourning. In 'The Kaleidoscope', Dunn adopts a very stoical, understated tone. He does not express any anger or despair, but instead suggests that he is trying to come to terms with his loss in a calm, measured way. His use of short, simple sentences and his avoidance of vivid imagery or metaphor suggests that he is trying to maintain a level of emotional detachment as he processes his grief. In contrast, Greenlaw's attitude towards grief is much more complex and ambiguous. She acknowledges the pain and confusion that comes with loss, but also suggests that grief can be transformative and even consoling. She uses images of light, water and nature to suggest that grief is part of the ongoing cycle of life and death, and that even in the darkest moments there is the possibility of renewal.
In conclusion, the two poems 'The Kaleidoscope' by Douglas Dunn and 'Underworld' by Lavinia Greenlaw deal with grief in different but complementary ways. Dunn's spare, understated language and conventional elegiac structure convey the raw intensity of his grief, while Greenlaw's rich, complex language and use of myth and culture references create a multi-layered and nuanced portrayal of loss. Each poem offers a unique perspective on the theme of grief, but both ultimately suggest that it is a universal part of the human experience, something that we must all confront and attempt to understand in our own way.
