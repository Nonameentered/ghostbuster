On the 8th of January, 1989, a tragic aviation disaster occurred at Kegworth, a small village in the East Midlands on the M1 motorway. British Midland Flight 92, a Boeing 737-400 from London Heathrow to Belfast, crashed onto the motorway embankment and bounced back onto the runway of East Midlands Airport, killing 47 of the 126 passengers and crew, and injuring many more. The disaster was a result of poor communication, inadequate crew resource management, and technical malfunctions. This essay aims to explore the factors that contributed to the Kegworth disaster and how it could have potentially been avoided.
One of the primary factors that led to the Kegworth disaster was a misidentification of an engine malfunction. Approximately eleven minutes after takeoff, the left engine of the Boeing 737-400, exhibited an unusual indication of a high oil temperature. The captain initiated the left engine shutdown procedure as per the emergency checklist, following which the first officer stated that the right engine had also failed. However, it was eventually later discovered that the right engine was still operating as intended, while it was the left engine that had failed. The crew had misinterpreted the information provided to them, and this irreversible decision order doomed the fate of the aircraft and its occupants.
The misidentification of the engine failure was compounded by the ineffective communication between the crew and the air traffic control (ATC) team. Despite the captain's initial request for an emergency landing, the ATC team did not offer any further assistance or detailed instructions in what was an already confusing situation. The controller was not informed about the suspected engine failure and the emergency declared on board. This lack of information limited the controller’s understanding of the situation, and he did not provide adequate support to the crew. Such misunderstandings, combined with inadequate real-time information exchange, significantly contributed to the crash.
Furthermore, human factors and crew resource management errors also played a role in the disaster. The cockpit voice recorder revealed that the captain didn't effectively utilize the cockpit crew's input to help resolve the problem with the aircraft, instead relied heavily on his own interpretation of available information. The captain and first officer did not communicate effectively with each other, and there was no evidence of a clear transfer of command from the captain to the first officer. The lack of leadership, inability to manage resource, and ineffective communication between the cockpit crew were essential contributors to the disaster.
Finally, the technical failure of the fuel crossfeed valve was also one of the significant contributing factors of the Kegworth disaster. In a four-engine jetliner, fuel can be distributed evenly among the four engines. However, in a two-engine jetliner such as the Boeing 737-400, the fuel has to be shared between the left and right engines. The airplane had a faulty fuel crossfeed valve that prevented the flow of fuel from one side to the other, meaning it was not providing consistent fuel to both engines. As a result, the airplane’s left engine had failed and rendered the aircraft’s left side aerodynamically unstable.
The Kegworth disaster could have potentially been avoided if several steps had been taken to prevent the engine failure from becoming disastrous. Firstly, the airplane manufacturer could have provided a better checklist for an engine shutdown, which would have prevented the misidentification of the engine failure. The checklist could have been written in a more concise, clear, and detailed way to guide the crew members through the emergency situation effectively. In addition, pilots could receive better training on how to interpret engine-related instrument readings, improving their ability to identify engine malfunctions, and accurately pass on this information to the appropriate ATC team.
Secondly, effective communication between the crew and ATC teams was critical to prevent the drop-offs. The receiver should have the most recent available information for a potential evasive action. Strategies such as standardized phraseology for emergency situations should have been implemented to ensure clarity and consistency in communication.
Thirdly, a better system of crew resource management could have prevented the disaster. The cockpit crew must be aware of their duties and roles, with clear communication on takeover of command to allow other members to feel at liberty to intervene and provide suggestions that could save the situation. The ‘sterile cockpit’ concept means all non-essential conversation should be avoided in critical phases of flight, and only information relevant to the mission should be communicated.
Lastly, airplane design and manufacture issues should be prioritized in safety policies, with constant revision and replacement of old and out of date equipment in planes. The crossfeed valve issue was due to poor design, which led to the disaster. Therefore, airplane manufacturers should continuously improve by emphasizing fault-tolerant engineering designs and redundant systems that enable the aircraft to deal with multiple issues or faults.
In conclusion, the Kegworth disaster was a result of several factors. The misidentification of an engine malfunction by the cockpit crew due to a faulty emergency checklist, ineffective communication between the cockpit crew and ATC, human and crew resource management errors, and technical malfunctions of the airplane. In retrospect, the disaster could have been prevented if preventive steps such as improved engine failure checklists, better pilot training, effective communication protocols, relevant cockpit resource management training, and prioritizing safe airplane manufacture and design were established. The aviation industry has since addressed these issues and put in measures to prevent such disasters in the future. As such, the Kegworth disaster was a significant lesson in aviation safety and an opportunity for the industry to embark on a safer path by considering the underlying faults that lead to aircraft disasters and rectifying them timely.
