Introduction
Discourse Analysis is the study of language in use. It is an interdisciplinary field that aims to understand the way language is used in social and cultural contexts. Discourse Analysis is applied to written text as well as spoken language, and it focuses on the communicative function of language. The study of written discourse involves analyzing the structure and language features of a text, as well as its context and purpose. The two main approaches to analyzing written discourse are cohesion and thematization.
This essay will discuss what Discourse Analysis is and how it is applied to written discourse. The essay will review the two main approaches to analyzing written discourse, cohesion and thematization, and provide a literary review of each approach. Finally, an analysis of a sample text using these approaches will be conducted, considering the context of the text and the features of cohesion and thematization, as well as any limitations of these approaches.
What is Discourse Analysis?
Discourse Analysis is the study of language in use. It is an interdisciplinary field that draws on linguistics, psychology, sociology, anthropology, and cultural studies. The focus of Discourse Analysis is on the communicative function of language, and it seeks to understand the way language is used in social and cultural contexts. It is concerned with the structure and organization of texts, as well as the social, cultural, and historical contexts in which they are produced and consumed.
Discourse Analysis can be applied to a wide range of texts, including spoken language, written texts, and visual media. In the case of written texts, Discourse Analysis involves analyzing the language features of a text, such as grammar, vocabulary, and syntax, as well as its structure, organization, and context.
Cohesion
Cohesion is one of the main approaches to analyzing written discourse. It involves analyzing the way a text is structured and organized, as well as the language features that create connections between different parts of the text. Cohesion is concerned with the relationships between words, phrases, and sentences within a text, as well as the broader structure of the text.
One of the key features of cohesion is reference. Reference refers to the ways in which words or phrases within a text refer to other words or phrases. This can include pronouns, such as "he" or "she," as well as more complex referencing devices, such as nominalization. Nominalization involves turning a verb or an adjective into a noun, as in "the realization that he was wrong."
Another key feature of cohesion is lexical cohesion. Lexical cohesion refers to the use of words and phrases that are related in meaning. This can include synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms, and hypernyms. For example, a text about the environment might use a range of words related to the topic, such as "pollution," "recycling," and "climate change."
Thematization
Thematization is another approach to analyzing written discourse. Thematization is concerned with the way a text is structured to create a coherent theme or argument. It involves analyzing the way the author organizes the content of the text to create a particular meaning or message.
One of the key features of thematization is foregrounding. Foregrounding involves drawing attention to a particular aspect of the text to create emphasis. This can include using repetition, contrasting different ideas, or using metaphorical language. For example, a text about the benefits of exercise might use metaphorical language to create emphasis: "Exercise is the key that unlocks the door to a healthy life."
Another key feature of thematization is the use of discourse markers. Discourse markers are words or phrases that help to structure the text and create coherence. These can include conjunctions, such as "however" or "therefore," as well as adverbs, such as "moreover" or "consequently."
Review of Cohesion and Thematization
Cohesion and thematization are two main approaches to analyzing written discourse. Each approach has its own strengths and limitations.
Cohesion is particularly useful for analyzing the structure and connections within a text. It enables the analyst to identify the ways in which different parts of the text are related, as well as the relationship between different words and phrases. Cohesion is also useful for analyzing the coherence of a text, as well as the way in which meaning is created.
However, cohesion has its limitations. It can be difficult to identify the relationships between words and phrases, particularly in complex texts. Cohesion analysis can also be time-consuming, as it requires careful attention to detail.
Thematization, on the other hand, is useful for analyzing the way a text is structured to create a particular meaning or message. It enables the analyst to identify the key themes and arguments within a text, as well as the way they are organized to create coherence.
However, thematization also has its limitations. It can be difficult to identify the key themes and arguments within a complex text, particularly if they are not explicitly stated. Thematization also relies on the analyst's interpretation of the text, which can be subjective.
Analysis of a Sample Text
To illustrate the application of cohesion and thematization to written discourse, a sample text will be analyzed. The text is an excerpt from a newspaper article about the impact of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef:
"The Great Barrier Reef, the world's largest living organism and one of Australia's most important natural icons, is under threat from climate change. Rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and coral bleaching are just some of the threats facing this fragile ecosystem. If action is not taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Great Barrier Reef could be irreversibly damaged within the next few decades."
Cohesion Analysis
The text is well-structured, with clear connections between different parts of the text. The opening sentence establishes the topic of the text ("the Great Barrier Reef") and its importance ("one of Australia's most important natural icons"). The second sentence introduces the main theme of the text ("climate change"). The third sentence lists some of the specific threats to the Great Barrier Reef ("rising sea temperatures, ocean acidification, and coral bleaching").
The final sentence draws together the different elements of the text and creates a conclusion ("If action is not taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Great Barrier Reef could be irreversibly damaged within the next few decades."). The text as a whole is cohesive, with each sentence relating to the others and contributing to the overall message of the text.
There are several examples of reference within the text. For example, "the Great Barrier Reef" is referred to as "the world's largest living organism" and "one of Australia's most important natural icons." These reference devices help to establish the importance of the Great Barrier Reef and create a sense of continuity within the text.
There is also an example of lexical cohesion within the text. The phrase "climate change" is repeated in the second sentence, creating a link between the main theme of the text and the specific threats to the Great Barrier Reef.
Thematization Analysis
The text is structured to create a clear message about the impact of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef. The opening sentence establishes the importance of the Great Barrier Reef as a natural icon. The second sentence introduces the main theme of the text, climate change, which is then developed in the third sentence by listing the specific threats to the Great Barrier Reef. The final sentence reinforces the message of the text by stating the potential consequences of inaction.
The use of the phrase "under threat from climate change" in the opening sentence foregrounds the main theme of the text, and draws attention to the seriousness of the situation. The use of the conditional tense in the final sentence ("the Great Barrier Reef could be irreversibly damaged") creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes the need for action.
The use of discourse markers also contributes to the coherence of the text. The conjunction "if" in the final sentence provides a link between the potential consequences of inaction and the action needed to prevent them. The use of the phrase "within the next few decades" provides a specific timeframe for action.
Limitations of Cohesion and Thematization
While cohesion and thematization are useful approaches for analyzing written discourse, there are some limitations to these approaches.
One limitation of cohesion analysis is that it can be time-consuming and requires careful attention to detail. It can also be difficult to identify the relationships between words and phrases in complex texts.
One limitation of thematization analysis is that it can rely on the analyst's interpretation of the text, which can be subjective. It can also be difficult to identify the key themes and arguments within a complex text, particularly if they are not explicitly stated.
Conclusion
Discourse Analysis is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to understand the way language is used in social and cultural contexts. Written discourse analysis involves analyzing the structure and language features of a text, as well as its context and purpose.
Cohesion and thematization are two main approaches to analyzing written discourse. Cohesion is concerned with the relationships between words, phrases, and sentences within a text, as well as the broader structure of the text. Thematization is concerned with the way a text is structured to create a particular meaning or message. Both approaches have their strengths and limitations, and their application depends on the specific text being analyzed.
The analysis of the sample text illustrates the application of cohesion and thematization to written discourse. The text is well-structured and cohesive, with clear connections between different parts of the text. The text is also structured to create a clear message about the impact of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef. Cohesion and thematization analysis can provide valuable insights into written discourse, but it is important to consider the limitations of these approaches and to use them in conjunction with other analytical techniques.
