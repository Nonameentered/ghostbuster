Egg production in the UK is a significant contributor to the country's economy. The industry has undergone significant changes in the recent past, ranging from advancements in production technologies to the enactment of regulations aimed at ensuring the production of high-quality and safe eggs. The UK's egg production industry comprises various production systems, each with its own processes, regulations, and benefits. In this essay, I will explore these different egg production systems, the process of egg production, and the regulations involved in selling eggs under the British Egg Industry Lion Code, using Wall-Hanger farm as an example. Additionally, I will examine the management practices employed by Wall-Hanger farm to address factors affecting egg production, the challenges faced by egg producers, such as fluctuations in the egg market and mortality within the flock, and ways through which these challenges can be addressed.
The Different Types of Egg Production Systems in the UK
The UK has four primary egg production systems for laying hens: Enriched cages, free-range, barn, and organic (DEFRA, 2021). Enriched cages are wire cages that provide a limited amount of space to hens and are typically found in indoor settings. These cages are equipped with perches and nesting areas, and hens are fed using automated feeding systems. The use of enriched cages has reduced significantly in the UK due to animal welfare concerns. The government's 2012 Welfare of Laying Hens Directive banned the use of barren cages and required farmers to switch to enriched cages and free-range systems (DEFRA, 2021). 
Free-range egg production is the most popular egg production method in the UK, accounting for over half of all egg production (DEFRA, 2021). Free-range hens have access to outdoor spaces and are fed using automated feeding systems. Farmers must provide their hens with a minimum indoor space allowance, natural light, and perches. Free-range hens are provided with special diets that include additional mineral supplements, vitamins, and protein sources, which ultimately result in higher quality eggs. Free-range eggs command a higher price in the market due to their perceived premium quality, taste, and animal welfare standards. 
Barn egg production is similar to free-range production, except that hens do not have access to outdoor spaces. Instead, they are kept in large indoor enclosures with natural lighting, and they are given more space to move around than those in enriched cages. Given that they do not have access to an outdoor range, barn hens are more susceptible to developing diseases and therefore require regular veterinary checks and strict biosecurity measures. 
Organic egg production is the highest welfare standard of all egg production systems in the UK. Organic eggs are produced by hens that have access to the outdoors and are given a special diet devoid of antibiotics, hormones, and other synthetic inputs. Additionally, organic farms must adhere to strict animal welfare regulations whereby hens must have access to appropriate lighting, nesting areas, and perches. Organic eggs command a premium price in the market due to their superior quality, purity, and ethical standards. 
The Process of Egg Production and Regulations involved in selling eggs under the British Egg Industry Lion Code, using Wall-Hanger Farm as an Example
Like in any other egg production system, egg production at Wall-Hanger Farm starts with the acquisition of day-old chicks. The chicks are sorted into small groups and kept in brooders under controlled temperature and lighting conditions until they are twelve weeks old. During this period, they are vaccinated against various diseases and antibiotics are administered as a preventative measure. After twelve weeks, the chicks are transferred to laying houses. The laying houses have nesting boxes, feeding troughs, and automatic drinking systems to provide the perfect environment for laying hens.
Wall-Hanger farm is a member of the British Egg Industry's Lion Code accreditation scheme. The scheme ensures that farmers adhere to strict production standards in terms of animal welfare, food safety, traceability, and environmental sustainability. The Lion Code certification allows Wall-Hanger farm to sell its eggs to major supermarkets, wholesalers, and catering establishments in the UK. 
Under the scheme, eggs must be collected by well-trained staff, sorted, and labeled to indicate the production system, best before date, and farm identification number. The eggs must be kept refrigerated at 5Â°C or below, and delivery vehicles used to transport eggs must be cleaned and disinfected regularly. Additionally, Lion Code certified farms must meet strict standards for animal welfare, biosecurity measures, and disease control.
Wall-Hanger Farm's Management Practices
Wall-Hanger farm employs various management practices to ensure optimum egg production and animal welfare standards. For example, the lighting in the laying houses is carefully managed to provide hens with the right amount of light to stimulate egg laying. Hens require 14 to 16 hours of light per day to maximize egg production (DEFRA, 2021). Lighting is controlled using a computerized system that adjusts light intensity depending on the time of day and season. 
Feeding also plays a crucial role in egg production. At Wall-Hanger farm, hens are fed a carefully balanced diet of cereals, pulses, and protein sources that provide the right nutritional mix for optimal egg production. Additionally, the feeding system is automated to ensure that the hens have access to food at all times, reducing stress and promoting healthy growth. Water supply is also continuously monitored and kept clean to prevent disease transmission. 
Temperature control is essential in egg production, as hens are susceptible to heat stress, which can result in reduced egg production, poor egg quality, and increased mortality. At Wall-Hanger farm, temperature control is managed through a computerized climate control system that regulates the temperature, humidity, and ventilation in the laying houses. The system is also equipped with backup generators in case of power outages. 
Challenges Faced by Egg Producers
Egg producers face various challenges that can negatively impact their profitability and sustainability. One such challenge is the fluctuation in the egg market prices. Egg prices are influenced by seasonal demand, supply chain dynamics, and changes in consumer preferences. When the market is oversupplied, prices can plummet, leading to financial insecurity for farmers. Conversely, when demand exceeds supply, prices can sky-rocket, driving down demand and potentially leading to the closure of farms.
Another challenge faced by egg producers is flock mortality. Mortality can be caused by various factors such as disease outbreaks, predation, poor nutrition, and environmental stresses. High mortality rates can result in reduced egg production, increased costs, and reduced profitability. To mitigate the effects of mortality, Wall-Hanger farm employs strict biosecurity measures, pre-emptive disease management, and appropriate farming practices. 
Conclusion
In conclusion, the UK's egg production industry is diverse, with four primary egg production systems in use. Each system has its own unique processes, regulations, and benefits. Selling eggs involves adherence to strict regulations, such as the British Egg Lion Code certification, which requires strict animal welfare standards and food safety protocols. Wall-Hanger farm employs various management practices to maximize egg production, such as lighting, feeding, and temperature control. Challenges faced by egg producers include fluctuations in the egg market and flock mortality. These challenges can be addressed through appropriate farming practices, risk management, and proactive measures. Overall, the UK's egg industry remains vital to the country's economy and food security, and there is a need for continued investment in the sector to ensure its sustainability.
