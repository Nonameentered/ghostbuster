Fairy tales are stories that have been enjoyed for generations. They are ageless stories that are often geared towards children, but often have lessons for adults as well. When it comes to creating written fairy tales, there are several factors that must be considered in order to ensure the story is cohesive and coherent. One critical element of this is the use of cohesive devices and structural patterns.
Cohesive devices are words or phrases that connect different parts of a sentence or passage together. They are used to create a bond or link between different sentences or paragraphs. The use of these devices helps to create a flow and coherence within the story. There are several different types of cohesive devices that can be employed, including transition words, repetition, pronouns, and conjunctions.
Transition words are essential in the creation of cohesive fairy tales. They help to guide the reader from one point in the story to the next, making it easier to follow along and understand the events that are occurring. For example, words like “once upon a time”, “afterward”, and “eventually” help to indicate the passing of time and give the reader a sense of the story's progression. Additionally, repetition of certain key phrases or ideas can create a sense of rhythm and continuity. For example, if a particular phrase is repeated throughout the story, it can help to keep the story cohesive and focused.
Pronouns are another critical type of cohesive device in fairy tales. When used effectively, they can help to create a sense of continuity and flow. Pronouns are especially useful when referring to characters in the story. Repeated use of the same pronouns (e.g., “he said”) can help to create a sense of familiarity with the character, making them easier to identify and follow throughout the story.
Conjunctions are also vital in creating cohesive fairy tales. They are particularly useful in linking ideas and sentences within paragraphs, and highlighting the relationship between different characters and events. For instance, the conjunction “but” can be used to indicate a contradiction in the story or the “and” conjunction can be used to create a series of events.
In addition to cohesive devices, structural patterns can also contribute significantly to the coherence and cohesion of fairy tales. Structural patterns refer to the way a story is organized, such as the order in which events or characters are introduced or how conflicts and resolutions unfold. Some fairy tales follow a linear narrative structure, where events occur in chronological order, while others may follow a more circular or non-linear structure.
One common structural pattern in fairy tales is the use of a formulaic plot. This type of plot is often used in stories that follow a specific narrative structure, wherein the story follows a hero or protagonist's journey from adversity to triumph. The hero may encounter obstacles or challenges along the way, but ultimately overcomes them through determination and perseverance. This pattern of a hero's journey is often found in popular fairy tales, such as “Cinderella” and “Snow White.”
Another structural pattern commonly seen in fairy tales is the use of archetypes or character types. Archetypes are essentially universal symbols or characters that are recognizable across cultures and time periods. In fairy tales, these archetypes are usually symbolic of certain characteristics or traits. For example, “the wicked stepmother” archetype, often found in stories like “Cinderella” represents cruelty and jealousy, while the “prince charming” archetype represents heroism. By adhering to these archetypes, writers can create a sense of familiarity and recognition for readers, helping to establish a cohesive and coherent fairy tale.
When it comes to the audience for which fairy tales are intended, cohesive devices and structural patterns help to create an accessible and engaging experience. Children, in particular, benefit from the use of cohesive devices, as they help to make the story more manageable for young readers. By employing these devices, writers can help to create a sense of clarity in their storytelling, making it easier for children to understand and participate in the story.
Similarly, the use of structural patterns is essential for creating stories that resonate with young readers. By using familiar patterns and narratives, writers can help children to connect with the story on a deeper level. This connection can help to make the story more meaningful and relevant to the child's life, which can help to foster a lifelong love of reading and learning.
In conclusion, cohesive devices and structural patterns significantly contribute to the cohesion and coherence of written fairy tales. By effectively using cohesive devices like transition words, pronouns, repetition, and conjunctions, writers can create a story that flows and has a sense of continuity. Additionally, by using structural patterns like formulaic plots and archetypes, writers can establish a familiarity and resonance with readers, creating a story that is both engaging and accessible. These elements are critical in creating successful fairy tales, particularly for the intended audience of children. By skillfully using these techniques, writers can create stories that will stand the test of time, continuing to enthrall and inspire readers for generations to come.
