John Locke’s theory on personal identity is a philosophy that is based on the idea that personal identity arises from consciousness. He viewed personal identity as a matter of psychological continuity. According to Locke, a person’s identity is defined by the conscious existence of thoughts and experiences over time. He believed that personal identity is formed by the continuous and uninterrupted existence of the same consciousness. In other words, to be the same person over time, there must be a continuity of individual consciousness from one time to the next. 
According to Locke, the self is not the same as the body. The body is strictly a physical entity that is subject to change, but the self is a psychological entity that is defined by the consciousness of the individual. Therefore, the body cannot define personal identity. In fact, Locke believed that personal identity can exist without a body. In his article “Of Identity and Diversity,” Locke stated, “Consciousness alone, and the dependence of identity on it, sufficiently shows that the identity of soul and body is not necessary to anything but to punish the negligence and mistakes of our own selves, who, by a careless handling of our thinking faculty, let it go loose from that which in this doctrine we have proved to be the only bond of personal identity, and so make way for those confusions which come in, by putting these terms where they have no confusion.”
As such, Locke’s theory does not allow one person to swap bodies with another person and still maintain the same personal identity. According to his theory, personal identity is determined by the consciousness of the individual, and the consciousness of each individual is unique. Therefore, if two people were to switch bodies, they would still have separate consciousnesses, and their personal identities would remain distinct.
However, there are criticisms of Locke’s theory that impact the answer to the original question. One criticism is that the continuity of consciousness is not always present. Memory loss or the inability to remember past experiences would lead to the interruption of psychological continuity. Another criticism is that physical or chemical changes in the brain can result in changes in consciousness that could also interrupt psychological continuity. For example, a person with a brain injury could experience a change in their consciousness that would result in a break in psychological continuity. 
Furthermore, Locke’s theory does not account for the possibility of multiple consciousnesses or the sharing of consciousness. If consciousness is what defines personal identity, then how would Locke’s theory explain the existence of individuals with multiple personalities, or those with dissociative identity disorder? The same concern arises if one considers the possibility of brain transplants, as it would be difficult to determine which consciousness would move with the transplanted brain, or if the brain would create a new consciousness.
Bernard Williams attempted to address the issue of personal identity in his article “The Self and the Future.” Williams’ theory is based on the idea that personal identity is not a matter of psychological continuity, but instead is closely linked to a person’s narrative. He believed that personal identity is not simply the sum of our past experiences, but rather it is our narrative that ties all of these experiences together. 
According to Williams, personal identity is rooted in the narrative of a person’s life. This narrative can include memories, experiences, and actions that have been integrated over time into a coherent whole. The person’s narrative defines who they are as a person and shapes their perceptions of themselves, their goals, and their aspirations. Williams’ theory addresses some of the criticisms of Locke’s theory. For example, Williams argued that it is not necessary to have a continuity of consciousness to maintain personal identity, as long as one’s narrative remains consistent.
Williams also addressed the issue of swapping bodies with another person. While he agreed with Locke that consciousness is necessary for personal identity, he argued that the body plays a crucial role in the formation of a person’s narrative. Therefore, swapping bodies with another person would result in a loss of the narrative that is tied to one’s original body. In Williams’ words, “I am this person, whose life is organized in a certain way, who has persisted through time and has had certain experiences. This is my narrative; it is an essential feature of who I am; and it is inseparable from my body.”
Williams’ theory provides a valuable insight into the concept of personal identity. By tying personal identity to a person’s narrative, Williams’ theory allows for greater flexibility when it comes to the continuity of consciousness. Williams’ theory also acknowledges the central role that the body plays in shaping a person’s identity. Unlike Locke’s theory, the body is seen as an integral part of the narrative that defines personal identity. 
In conclusion, John Locke’s theory of personal identity holds that personal identity arises from consciousness. He viewed personal identity as a matter of psychological continuity, which means that a person’s identity is defined by the conscious existence of thoughts and experiences over time. Based on this theory, it is not possible to swap bodies with another person and still maintain the same personal identity. However, there are valid criticisms that suggest the theory might not be sufficient to account for some scenarios. Bernard Williams’ theory of personal identity, on the other hand, ties personal identity to a person’s narrative, which acknowledges the central role that the body plays in forming a person’s identity. Therefore, both theories have limitations and offer different perspectives on personal identity.
