Introduction
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) can take many forms, but one of the most complex and challenging types of M&A is the conglomerate merger. A conglomerate merger is a merger between companies that are in different industries or markets. The purpose of this essay is to explain the concept of conglomerate mergers and to discuss their anti-competitive effects under European Community (EC) law. The essay will explore the criteria used to evaluate conglomerate mergers and the main concerns of European authorities. The different approaches taken before and after the Tetra Laval/Sidel case will be analyzed, and the standards of proof required to establish the potential harm of these mergers will be evaluated, particularly in relation to the portfolio effect and leveraging. Finally, the essay will discuss the role of courts in checking the conduct and decisions of the Commission and evaluate the criticisms raised by the Commission regarding the CFI settlement.
Characterization of Conglomerate Mergers
Conglomerate mergers are mergers between companies that operate in different markets or industries. Typically, these mergers are horizontal or vertical, which means that they involve firms that are either in the same market or industry or in related markets. However, conglomerate mergers often do not involve horizontal or vertical integration but instead involve the integration of companies in completely unrelated markets or industries. For example, a merger between an automobile manufacturer and a soft drink producer would be a conglomerate merger. The goal of conglomerate mergers is usually to diversify the business and to increase the market power of the combined firm.
The anti-competitive effect of conglomerate mergers is that they can lead to a reduction in competition in unrelated markets. This is because the merged company may have greater bargaining power in both the market in which it previously operated and the new market in which it has entered. This can lead to higher prices for consumers, reduced choice, and lower innovation.
Criteria used to evaluate conglomerate mergers
The criteria used to evaluate conglomerate mergers under EC law are similar to those used to evaluate other types of M&A. The primary criterion used by the EC is the impact of the merger on competition in the market. The EC evaluates the concentration of the merged firm in the relevant market and the potential for the merged firm to increase its market power. Other factors that may be considered include the entry barriers to the market, the bargaining power of customers and suppliers, and the effect on innovation.
In addition to the impact on competition, the EC may also consider the impact of the merger on employment, research and development, and other social issues. The EC will also consider whether the merger would cause any harm to consumers, such as higher prices, reduced quality, or reduced choice.
Main concerns of European authorities
The EC is the main European authority responsible for evaluating mergers and acquisitions. Its primary concern is the potential for the merger to have an anti-competitive effect on the market. This is because the EC is committed to ensuring that there is a competitive marketplace in the European Union (EU), which benefits consumers and promotes innovation.
The EC is also concerned about companies that may abuse their dominant position in the market. This means that the EC is concerned about companies that may use their market power to increase prices, reduce choice, and suppress innovation. The EC is also concerned about the potential for companies to engage in predatory pricing or other anti-competitive practices designed to exclude competitors from the market.
Different approaches taken before and after the Tetra Laval/Sidel case
Before the Tetra Laval/Sidel case, the EC had taken a relatively lenient approach to conglomerate mergers. The EC tended to focus on the potential for the merger to have an anti-competitive effect on individual markets, rather than considering the impact on competition in unrelated markets. However, the Tetra Laval/Sidel case changed the approach of the EC and led to a greater emphasis on the potential harm caused by conglomerate mergers.
In the Tetra Laval/Sidel case, the EC rejected the merger between Tetra Laval and Sidel, a maker of bottle production equipment. The EC found that the merger would have given the merged firm a dominant position in the market for aseptic packaging machines, which are used in the production of aseptic drinks. However, the EC also found that the merger could have a portfolio effect by giving the merged firm an advantage in the market for plastic packaging machinery, which is not directly related to aseptic packaging machines. The EC concluded that the merger would lead to a significant reduction in competition in both markets and that it should be blocked.
Since the Tetra Laval/Sidel case, the EC has taken a more aggressive approach to conglomerate mergers. The EC now considers the potential for a portfolio effect, which means that the merged firm may have an advantage in unrelated markets due to its increased market power. The EC also evaluates the potential for leveraging, which means that the merged firm may use its increased market power in one market to gain an advantage in another market.
Standards of proof required to establish the potential harm of these mergers
To establish the potential harm of a conglomerate merger, the EC must demonstrate that the merger would lead to a significant reduction in competition in the relevant markets. To do this, the EC will analyze the concentration of the merged firm in the relevant markets and the potential for the merged firm to increase its market power. The EC will also consider other relevant factors, such as entry barriers, the bargaining power of customers and suppliers, and the potential for the merger to lead to lower innovation.
In addition to demonstrating the potential harm to competition, the EC must also demonstrate that the harm would outweigh any potential benefits of the merger, such as increased efficiency, innovation, or economies of scale. The EC will evaluate the specific circumstances of the merger and consider whether there are any alternative ways to achieve the same benefits without reducing competition.
Portfolio effect and leveraging
The portfolio effect and leveraging are two of the key concerns associated with conglomerate mergers. The portfolio effect refers to the potential for the merged firm to have an advantage in unrelated markets due to its increased market power. For example, if a soft drink producer merged with an automobile manufacturer, the merged firm may have an advantage in both the soft drink and automobile markets due to its increased market power. The EC will evaluate the potential for a portfolio effect and may block the merger if it finds that the portfolio effect would reduce competition in the relevant markets.
Leveraging refers to the potential for the merged firm to use its increased market power in one market to gain an advantage in another market. For example, if a company that had a dominant position in the search engine market acquired a social media platform, it may use its dominant position in the search engine market to promote its social media platform at the expense of competitors. The EC will evaluate the potential for leveraging and may block the merger if it finds that the leveraging would reduce competition in the relevant markets.
Role of courts in checking the conduct and decisions of the Commission
The role of courts in checking the conduct and decisions of the EC is essential in ensuring that the EC is acting in accordance with the law. Companies have the right to appeal the decisions of the EC, and the courts will evaluate whether the EC has acted in accordance with the law. This includes evaluating whether the EC has followed the proper procedures and whether its decisions are consistent with EC law.
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued several significant decisions regarding the evaluation of mergers. In particular, the ECJ has clarified the scope of the EC's powers to review mergers and has emphasized the importance of maintaining competition in the European Union. The ECJ has also emphasized the need to balance the potential benefits of a merger against the potential harm to competition.
Criticism of the CFI settlement
The CFI settlement refers to the settlement between the Commission and the French oil company Total over Total's acquisition of the chemical company Elf Aquitaine. The settlement was controversial because it allowed Total to acquire Elf Aquitaine without any significant divestitures, which many critics believe led to higher prices in the market for polypropylene, one of the key products produced by the merged firm.
The EC has criticized the CFI settlement, stating that it was a mistake and that it did not adequately consider the impact of the merger on competition. The EC has also stated that the settlement was a one-time exception and that future mergers will be subject to a more rigorous review process.
Conclusion
Conglomerate mergers are complex and contentious transactions that can have significant anti-competitive effects. The EC is responsible for evaluating these mergers and ensuring that they do not reduce competition in the European Union. The criteria used to evaluate conglomerate mergers include the impact on competition in the relevant markets, the potential for a portfolio effect, and the potential for leveraging. The Tetra Laval/Sidel case led to a more aggressive approach by the EC, and the potential for a portfolio effect and leveraging are now key concerns. The role of courts is essential in checking the conduct and decisions of the EC, and the CFI settlement has been criticized for its failure to adequately consider the impact of the merger on competition. The EC is committed to ensuring that there is a competitive marketplace in the European Union, and the evaluation of conglomerate mergers is an essential part of this commitment.
