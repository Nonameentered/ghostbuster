Frozen foods are now an integral part of our lives as they are a convenient option for those who don't have the time to cook or for those who want to save time. Although the freezing process preserves its nutritional value, it can also be a cause of several quality issues.
The freezing process works by lowering the temperature of the food to below its freezing point, the water present in the food will freeze and preserve the food. The quality of the frozen food can be affected by several factors such as temperature fluctuations during shipping and storage, the rate of freezing, and ice crystal formation.
One method of freezing that is widely used in the industry is plate freezing, a technology that uses a series of flat plates that cool the food in layers. This method minimizes the formation of ice crystals and preserves the texture of the food.
Enzymatic activity is a significant concern when it comes to frozen foods. Enzymes can cause the deterioration of color, flavor, and texture of the food. Proteolytic enzymes, for instance, can cause meat to have a mushy texture when frozen. To prevent this, food processors use blanching or heat treatment before freezing.
The rate of freezing is crucial in maintaining the quality of the food. A faster rate of freezing will cause smaller ice crystals that will result in less damage to the cell structure of the food, thus preserving the texture and nutritional value. On the other hand, a slow rate of freezing will cause larger ice crystals that will harm the cell structure, resulting in a loss of flavor, texture, and nutrients.
In conclusion, the quality of frozen foods can be affected by several factors, and it is essential to take them into account when processing them. Plate freezing is a popular method of freezing that minimizes ice crystal formation and preserves the texture of the food. To prevent enzymatic activity, blanching or heat treatment is necessary. The rate of freezing is also crucial, and it is best to freeze foods as quickly as possible to minimize damage to their cell structure. By taking these factors into account, we can preserve the quality and nutritional value of frozen foods.
