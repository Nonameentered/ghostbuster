Business-IT alignment is an essential concept that determines the extent of success that firms can achieve in today’s competitive and dynamic business environment. As technological advancements continue to dominate the corporate world, organizations face numerous pressure and challenges to align their IT systems with business objectives. The idea behind business-IT alignment is to ensure that an organization’s IT strategy is consistent with its overall business strategy. The process requires firms to ensure that their technology infrastructure, resources, and processes are aligned with the company’s vision, objectives, and goals. Despite the significant contributions to organizations, business-IT alignment has been faced with numerous difficulties including the measurability of alignment and the commoditization of IT. This paper discusses the role of business-IT alignment in gaining a competitive advantage, how organizations can achieve alignment, contribution of IT to the success of organizations and the antecedents of alignment. 
Alignment between business and IT is essential to achieve a competitive advantage. Aligning business and IT strategies can help organizations to increase its efficiency, productivity, and competitive edge over its rivals. Through alignment, firms can gain both tangible and intangible benefits that can boost their performance in the market. Alignment can enable firms to leverage IT to create and capture value while meeting their business objectives and customer needs. Organizations that have successfully achieved business-IT alignment can use IT to minimize operational costs, enhance customer experience, improve decision-making processes, create new business models, and innovate new products and services. 
According to Chan and Reich (2007), business-IT alignment contributes to the success of organizations in three ways. The first is that it enhances better business process management. Business-IT alignment enables organizations to optimize business processes through the automation of routine tasks, which reduces operational costs, errors, and improves efficiency. The second contribution is that alignment enhances innovation and agility. IT provides a platform for organizations to innovate new products and services through the integration of information systems, which helps firms to respond quickly to the changing market needs. Thirdly, business-IT alignment contributes to the strategic development of organizations. Alignment enables organizations to anticipate future trends and changes in the market, which helps them to develop strategic plans that can increase their competitive edge. 
To achieve business-IT alignment, organizations need to implement various strategies. Some of these strategies may vary depending on the company's size, culture, and technology infrastructure. However, some common practices can be followed to achieve alignment. One strategy that organizations can use is through the creation of IT governance structures. IT governance structures help firms to create a framework for managing and aligning IT with business objectives. The governance framework ensures that IT resources are used effectively and efficiently to create value for the organization. Another strategy is through the alignment of IT investments with business objectives. IT investments should be based on the company's strategic objectives to avoid wastage of resources. By aligning IT investments with business objectives, organizations can ensure that their IT systems contribute to the company's overall goals. 
Furthermore, alignment can be achieved through the creation of cross-functional teams. Cross-functional teams can bring together individuals with diverse skill sets and knowledge and help integrate IT with business objectives. Also, organizations can implement training programs to enhance the IT skills of their employees. This helps the employees to understand how the IT systems work, and how it can be used to create value for the organization. Additionally, partnerships and collaborations can help organizations to achieve business-IT alignment. Partnerships with IT vendors and providers can help firms to acquire the necessary IT infrastructure and resources that can enhance the delivery of products and services to customers. 
The contribution of IT to the success of organizations has been widely discussed in the literature. IT has transformed the way organizations conduct business, and it has revolutionized the business processes and models. IT has become a critical component in the success of organizations, and it has gained immense importance in the corporate world. IT supports the various business functions such as marketing, finance, operations, and administration, which helps firms to carry out their activities more efficiently and effectively. IT systems can help organizations automate routine business processes, which reduces errors, improves efficiency, and frees up employees to concentrate on value-added activities. IT systems can also store and analyze data, which helps firms to make data-driven decisions that can increase their competitive edge. 
Furthermore, IT systems can help organizations to create and capture value. IT plays a vital role in the innovation process, which enables firms to develop new products and services that can meet the changing customer needs. By leveraging IT, organizations can create new business models, which can increase their profitability and competitiveness in the market. IT can also help firms to improve customer experience by providing personalized and customized services that meet their needs. 
Several antecedents have been identified that contribute to the success of business-IT alignment. One of the antecedents is the strategic orientation of the organization. Organizations that have a strategic orientation are more likely to align their IT systems with their business objectives. Organizations that have a clear vision, goals, and objectives are more likely to utilize IT systems that complement their strategic goals. The second antecedent is IT competency. Organizations that have IT competencies are more likely to align their IT systems with their business objectives. IT competency enables organizations to develop and implement IT systems that align with their business objectives, which improves their performance. 
The third antecedent is the organizational culture. Organizations that have a culture of collaboration and communication are more likely to achieve business-IT alignment. A culture that supports communication and collaboration can help individuals in the organization to understand the importance of IT in meeting business objectives. Additionally, the organizational structure can contribute to the success of business-IT alignment. Organizations that have a flat structure are more likely to align their IT systems with their business objectives. The flat structure enables individuals to interact with one another and share information, which reduces silos and encourages collaboration. 
Despite the potential benefits of business-IT alignment, organizations face several challenges and difficulties. One major challenge is the measurability of the degree of alignment. It is not easy to measure the extent to which IT systems are aligned with business objectives. A lack of a framework to measure alignment can make it challenging for organizations to evaluate the effectiveness of their alignment strategies. Additionally, with the commoditization of IT, it is becoming increasingly difficult for organizations to achieve differentiation through IT. As IT systems become more standardized, it is becoming more challenging for organizations to create unique value propositions from IT systems. 
In conclusion, business-IT alignment is essential for organizations that are looking to gain a competitive advantage in a dynamic and competitive business environment. Alignment between business and IT strategies enables organizations to increase their efficiency, productivity, and agility, which can help them to achieve their goals. Through alignment, organizations can leverage IT to create and capture value while meeting their business objectives and customer needs. Achieving business-IT alignment requires organizations to implement various strategies such as the creation of IT governance structures, aligning IT investments with business objectives, training employees, and collaborating with partners. Despite the challenges and difficulties faced by organizations, business-IT alignment remains a critical component in achieving business success.
