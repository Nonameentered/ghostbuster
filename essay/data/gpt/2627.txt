Bronze Age hoarding is a practice where individuals or groups of people bury valuable objects or artifacts with the intention of retrieving them later. Hoarding is a common phenomenon seen in various societies throughout history, including the Bronze Age. Archaeological excavations have unearthed numerous hoards of metal objects and artifacts belonging to the Bronze Age, leading to various theories about the purpose and significance of Bronze Age hoarding. This essay will explore the different theories behind Bronze Age hoarding and what can be learned from the different types of hoards found in archaeological excavations.
Bronze Age hoarding can be broadly categorized into two types- ritual hoarding and economic hoarding. According to the theory of ritual hoarding, there was a religious or ceremonial significance behind burying objects in the ground. The act of hoarding was considered as an offering to the gods or as a way of appeasing them. The objects buried in such hoards were usually expensive and luxurious, indicating that they were meant as special offerings.  The theory of economic hoarding, on the other hand, suggests that hoarding was done for practical reasons such as keeping the objects safe from enemies during times of war or times of socio-economic instability.
One example of an economic hoard is the Eberswalde hoard discovered in Germany in 1913. The hoard consisted of 81 individual objects, including axes, chisels, and other tools, made of copper and gold. The hoard was buried during the Late Bronze Age between 1000 and 800 BC, indicating that it was a time of instability and conflict. The hoard was discovered in a pit that had been deliberately dug, indicating that the hoard was intentionally hidden to keep the objects safe from the enemy. Similar hoards discovered in different parts of Europe, such as the Nebra Sky Disk found in Germany, suggest that economic hoarding was a common practice during the Bronze Age.
Another example of Bronze Age hoarding that supports the theory of ritual hoarding is the Mold Cape, discovered in Wales in 1833. The Mold Cape, dating back to the Early Bronze Age, is a delicate sheet of beaten gold shaped like a cape. The object was discovered buried in a stone cist with other objects such as a bronze spearhead, flint knives, and a bead necklace. The gold cape is covered with intricate patterns that suggest that it was an object of great value and rarity. The presence of other objects in the hoard indicates that it was not an economic hoard but a ritual offering. The delicateness of the gold, as well as the complex designs, suggest that the cape was not meant for everyday use but rather as a symbol of social status and religious significance.
One theory related to the ritual significance of Bronze Age hoarding is the idea of the cult of the sun. The cult of the sun was a religious belief system that was widespread during the Bronze Age. The people of that time believed that the sun was a god, and they practiced sun worship as part of their religious rituals. They believed that the sun was the source of all life and that it was to be revered and worshipped. The link between the cult of the sun and Bronze Age hoarding is that the hoards often contain objects that depict the sun or other celestial bodies. Many of the hoards have objects such as three-legged pots, which were believed to be symbolic of the sun, or objects decorated with sun-like motifs. This suggests that the hoards were intended as offerings to the sun god, as part of their religious practices.
Another theory related to the significance of Bronze Age hoarding is the idea of prestige goods. Prestige goods are goods that have a high value and are often used to demonstrate social status. Prestige goods were an important part of the Bronze Age economy, and hoarding may have been a way of acquiring such goods. The objects buried in hoards were often rare, expensive, and made of precious materials, indicating that they were intended to be used as prestige goods. By hoarding and burying such objects, the owners could demonstrate their wealth, status, and power. The discovery of hoards containing precious objects such as gold jewelry, bronze axes, and silver vessels supports this theory.
In conclusion, Bronze Age hoarding is a fascinating phenomenon that has left behind rich archaeological artifacts that reveal much about the society and beliefs of that time. The different theories behind Bronze Age hoarding, including the economic theory of hoarding for protection, the religious theory of ritual offerings, the prestige theory of acquiring and displaying wealth, and the cult of the sun theory, all provide valuable insights into the significance and purpose of these hoards. By examining the different types of hoards found in excavations, we can learn much about the societyâ€™s values, beliefs, and motivations during the Bronze Age.
