The focus of this material selection report is to determine the most suitable materials for a given engineering project. This report aims to provide the reader with information on a range of materials, including their properties, advantages, and disadvantages, to help them make a well-informed decision on which material to use.
The Cambridge Engineering Selector is an essential tool to aid in decision-making within this report. It helps in the selection of the right material by providing a systematic approach to evaluating materials against specific criteria. The use of this selector allows one to compare materials on a material property chart, which helps in identifying the most suitable material for the project.
An example from the report of the benefits of using the Cambridge Engineering Selector is in the comparison of steel and aluminum. The report notes that aluminum is a better material choice when it comes to weight-saving, as it is lighter than steel. By using the Cambridge Engineering Selector, an engineer can determine the properties of the two metals, such as their strengths, and decide on the best material choice based on the needs of the project.
Another example from the report is the use of the Cambridge Engineering Selector for selecting plastic materials. The report discusses various plastic materials, such as polycarbonate and ABS, and compares their mechanical properties, thermal properties, and environmental resistance. This allows for a well-informed decision on the best material for the project.
In conclusion, the focus of this material selection report is to provide a systematic and well-informed approach to selecting the best material for an engineering project. The use of the Cambridge Engineering Selector is an essential tool in aiding in decision-making and ensures the most suitable material is chosen for the project.
