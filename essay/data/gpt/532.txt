Ikea's main performance objectives are centered around providing its customers with low-priced and high-quality furniture products. In order to achieve this, the company focuses on three specific goals: cost-effective production, efficient supply chain management, and highly optimized store layout and design. These objectives have been set in order to ensure that Ikea can provide customers with the best value for their money.
Ikea's overall competitive strategy is centered around creating a unique brand image that appeals to budget-conscious customers. The company's focus on low-priced, high-quality products, along with its emphasis on design and style, has helped it to differentiate itself from traditional competitors. The company's competitive strategy has also been shaped by its focus on sustainability and environmentalism, which has helped it to appeal to socially conscious consumers.
In comparison to traditional competitors, Ikea's objectives are somewhat unique. While other furniture retailers focus on high-end furniture and premium prices, Ikea focuses on creating affordable furniture that is functional and stylish. This has led to Ikea's competitive advantage in the industry, as it has effectively segmented the market and created a unique brand image.
To achieve these performance objectives, Ikea has made several strategic decisions. For instance, the company focuses on minimizing production costs by using flat pack furniture and ensuring that manufacturing and supply chain processes are highly streamlined. Additionally, the company has invested heavily in its store design and layout, ensuring that customers can easily find what they are looking for and that they are compelled to purchase more products.
Ikea's objective of having a "Scandinavian feel" in its furniture designs does create tension between marketing and operations. This is because the company's marketing team must ensure that the company's products are appealing to consumers, while the operations team must ensure that the products can be produced efficiently and cost-effectively. To balance these conflicting objectives, Ikea focuses heavily on design and aesthetic, while also ensuring that manufacturing processes are highly optimized. This has enabled the company to continue to deliver its unique brand of affordable, functional, and stylish furniture products to its customers around the world.
