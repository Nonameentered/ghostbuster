The Ottoman Empire, once one of the most powerful global empires, eventually fell under the weight of numerous factors that affected its stability, security, and economic power. Historians have cited a range of causes such as political decline, weak leadership, military defeats, economic instability, ethnic disparities, and the rise of nationalism. One popular explanation is that the decline of European transit trade was the leading cause for the downfall of the Ottoman Empire. While this factor did play a role in the Empire's decline, it should not be deemed as the main cause. Instead, the primary factors behind the Ottomans’ decline were internal political, economic, and social factors that weakened the empire's ability to maintain its status as a world power.
Firstly, one of the factors that contributed to the Ottoman Empire's decline was its declining political power. By the 19th century, the Ottoman rulers' authority waned significantly. The decline in political power was augmented by ineffective rulers and weak institutions, leaving the empire in a vulnerable state. The Ottomans failed to adapt to modern governance mechanisms or maintain adequate infrastructure to support an advanced administration. Moreover, they failed to adopt an open-minded and secular approach to governance, unlike the French and British, which led to political and social upheavals within the empire. The Empire's governance system began to fall apart, with corruption and incompetence becoming rampant in administering the country.
Another crucial factor that led to the fall of the Ottoman Empire was the deteriorating economic conditions. Ottoman economy rested on an agricultural base, but by the 19th century, the economy had shifted towards trade and commerce. The Ottomans could not keep pace with economic advancements made by other European nations and remained relatively backward in the late 19th century. Additionally, they relied heavily on the production and export of raw agricultural products, but global market trends changed, and the Ottoman Empire was unable to adapt to the new conditions. Furthermore, the Ottomans failed to invest in national industries, further weakening the economy. This eventually left the empire heavily indebted to foreign powers.
Ethnic disparities and internal division further contributed to the decline of the Ottoman Empire. By the 19th century, ethnic nationalism was on the rise in various parts of the empire. The Ottomans found it difficult to manage the heterogeneity of the ethnic groups under their dominion, and nationalistic sentiments led to calls for independence in different regions. The empire also faced mounting pressure from the outside world with European powers adopting an aggressive colonization policy, and the Ottoman’s central administration was unable to keep up.
Military incapacity was another factor that contributed to the Ottoman Empire's decline. The Ottoman military enjoyed numerous victories in the early centuries, but by the 19th century, the army was outdated and its weaponry inferior compared to Europe's modern armies. The Ottomans were unable to match modern military advancements and faced mounting threats from the Russian Empire, who regarded themselves as traditional adversaries of the Ottomans. The Ottoman army was defeated in a series of wars, including the Crimean War in 1853 and the Balkan Wars in 1912-13, which further weakened the empire's already fragile state.
Various reasons can also shed light on why the loss of European transit trade was not the significant cause of the Ottoman Empire's decline. Firstly, transit trade was primarily limited to a few cities and ports, and the Ottomans did not generate substantial revenue from it. At the Empire's height in the early 17th century, the entirety of European transit trade contributed to less than 1% of the Ottoman GDP. Secondly, the Ottomans only controlled certain strategic positions that allowed them to impose transit fees on goods passing through their territory. The Ottomans held a monopoly over particular products, which meant that European traders had to pass through Ottoman-controlled trade routes if dealing in these commodities. However, Ottoman ports and routes were not the only means of trade, and overland and sea traders often bypassed them. Additionally, the Ottomans lacked access to modern vessels, increasing transit time and costs, making the trade route unattractive to European merchants.
Moreover, European transit trade was primarily a facilitator of European trade rather than a significant revenue generator for the Ottomans. The European powers exploited their dominance of international markets to control prices, leaving the Ottomans with little bargaining power. The traders would buy raw materials for low prices, process them into finished goods, and sell them at higher prices. By fulfilling this role, the Ottomans meagerly profited from the transit trade.  Besides, transit trade declined due to the rise of steamships, the opening of the Suez Canal, and the shift from traditional to modern production methods. These factors undermined the Ottoman economy by destroying the transit role that the Ottomans once enjoyed. 
In conclusion, the decline of the Ottoman Empire did not result from the decline of European transit trade, but myriads of factors influenced it. The internal political, economic, and social factors that weakened the empire's governance caused the falling authority while the loss of national industries was an economic setback. Also, military weakness made the empire vulnerable to external threats and further laid the foundation stone to the Empire's decline. While it is true that the loss of transit trade affected the Ottoman empire, it was not the primary factor that caused the Empire's collapse. It was significant but relatively insignificant to the internal factors that weakened the Ottoman’s ability to keep pace with the rapidly changing international environment.
