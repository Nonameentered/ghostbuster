Gambling is a prevalent activity that has been practiced by human societies for centuries. The thrill and excitement of this activity have attracted millions of people worldwide, making it a significant contributor to the entertainment industry. However, gambling has been associated with various consequences, including addiction, negative financial outcomes, and mental health problems. In recent years, researchers have shown a growing interest in investigating the relationship between mood state and gambling behavior. Gee, Coventry, and Birkenhead (2005) conducted a study to examine this relationship. In this essay, I will discuss the findings of their research and evaluate its advantages and disadvantages, specifically in terms of internal validity, external validity, structure validity, and reliability. Moreover, I will suggest possible improvements that can be made on their experiment to increase its overall quality.
Gee, Coventry, and Birkenhead (2005) conducted a quasi-experimental design to identify the relationship between mood state and gambling behavior. They used a sample of 48 participants who were recruited based on their level of gambling engagement. The participants were required to complete a mood measure before entering a simulated casino environment. The researchers manipulated the participants' mood state by exposing them to either a positive or negative mood-related video clip. The participants were then given a specific amount of money to use for gambling. The study aimed to explore how mood state influenced gambling behavior, specifically through the amount of money spent and the frequency of betting.
The results of the study showed that participants in a positive mood state gambled significantly more compared to those in a negative mood state. The participants in the positive mood state also reported higher levels of enjoyment and arousal while gambling. These results suggest that positive mood states increase the likelihood of risky gambling behavior.
However, despite the findings, the researchers faced some challenges related to the design of their experiment. Firstly, the quasi-experimental design used did not include a control group. The lack of a control group prevented the researchers from establishing the baseline behavior of the participants before implementing the intervention. Additionally, the sample size was relatively small, which reduced the generalizability of the findings. The use of a simulated casino environment also meant that the study may not reflect actual gambling behavior, as the participants were not gambling with their money.
Concerning internal validity, the quasi-experimental design used in the study had several limitations. The research design did not control many extraneous variables that may have influenced the results, such as the participants' previous experiences with gambling, age, gender, and ethnicity. This lack of control limits the researchers' ability to infer causality between mood state and gambling behavior. Moreover, the study's reliance on self-reported measures may have resulted in social desirability bias, where participants may have provided answers they deemed socially appropriate rather than the truth.
In terms of external validity, the study's sample size was small, making it difficult to generalize the findings to the larger population. Furthermore, the study's use of a simulated environment raises questions as to whether the study's findings would translate to actual gambling environments. As previously mentioned, the participants did not gamble with their money, which may have influenced their gambling behavior. Therefore, the external validity of the study is limited.
Concerning structure validity, the study's quasi-experimental design allowed for the manipulation of certain variables that may have impacted the results. The simulated casino environment and the videos shown to the participants were specific to the study, and their manipulation added evidence to the relationship between mood and gambling. However, as noted, the study did not control for several extraneous variables, limiting the study's structure validity.
Concerning reliability, the study's findings are consistent with other research conducted in the same field, where individuals in a positive mood state are more likely to display risky behavior. Moreover, the study's methods were well-documented, thereby increasing the study's reliability. However, as discussed, the sample size was small, which may have reduced the reliability of the findings.
Overall, the quasi-experimental design used by Gee, Coventry, and Birkenhead (2005) has unique advantages and disadvantages. The study's design allowed for the manipulation of specific variables, which enhanced the research's ability to establish the relationship between mood state and gambling behavior. However, the use of a simulated environment and the lack of a control group may have limited the study's internal validity. The small sample size and lack of representativeness limit the external validity of the study. Moreover, the study's reliance on self-reported measures may have introduced bias, reducing its reliability.
To improve the study's overall quality, several changes could be implemented. Firstly, the use of a control group to establish the participants' baseline behavior before implementing the intervention could improve the study's internal validity. Secondly, increasing the sample size and using a more representative sample could enhance the external validity of the study. Thirdly, the study's reliance on self-reported measures should be balanced with objective measures, such as physiological measures. Fourthly, controlling extraneous variables such as age, gender, and ethnicity could improve the structure validity of the study. Lastly, the use of actual gambling environments and gambling with real money could increase the ecological validity of the study.
In conclusion, Gee, Coventry, and Birkenhead (2005) conducted a study to examine the relationship between mood state and gambling behavior. The results of the study showed a positive correlation between a positive mood state and increased risky gambling behavior. However, the quasi-experimental design used had several limitations related to internal validity, external validity, structure validity, and reliability. Possible improvements to the study include the use of a control group, increasing the sample size, and using more objective measures. By implementing these changes, the study's overall quality and generalizability could be significantly improved.
