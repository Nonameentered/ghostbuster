Revenue management is a critical aspect of the hospitality industry. It is a strategic approach to optimize revenue by adjusting prices, managing inventory, and forecasting demand. Revenue management emerged in the airline industry in the 1980s, where airlines had to adopt new strategies due to deregulation. As a result, the hospitality industry has also adopted this approach to maximize revenue and profits. While revenue management has many advantages for hotels, there are also issues that surround this practice. Hotels must ensure that their revenue management practices are perceived as fair and reasonable by all types of customers. This essay will explore these issues and offer recommendations for integrating customer relationship management with revenue management to ensure customer loyalty is not compromised.
Revenue management is known for its benefits to the hospitality industry. First, revenue management allows hotels to optimize prices according to different customer segments, seasons, events, and other factors that affect demand. By utilizing data and analytics, revenue management can predict demand in advance and adjust prices accordingly, providing the hotel business with an opportunity to increase revenue. Additionally, revenue management can help hotels increase their occupancy rate. When the hotel has a high occupancy rate, it can increase its revenue from guests, as well as from other services such as room service, spa treatment, and other amenities.
However, revenue management has its drawbacks. Often, the pricing strategies employed under revenue management lead to price discrimination. Differential pricing is common, and it is understandable, as hotels are trying to make up for costs and maximize profits. However, customers that pay more often feel cheated when they discover that someone who booked the same room for a lower price.
Moreover, revenue management can have an adverse effect on the customers’ view of the hotel's quality. For example, hotels may offer lower quality services to customers who book through third-party booking sites such as booking.com or Expedia. This could cause frustration for consumers who might feel that they have paid for high-quality service that they do not receive.
Given that revenue management affects customers’ perception of quality and has the potential for pricing discrimination, it is imperative that hotels ensure that their revenue management practices are perceived as fair and reasonable by all types of customers. 
Transparency is crucial when it comes to revenue management. Hotels need to be upfront about their pricing strategy, including any promotions and discounts, and how they are managed. Furthermore, hotels must be more transparent about the room inventory which is available and discuss why they must differ room pricing. With that transparency, consumers will understand and appreciate the reason for pricing differences.
One way of ensuring transparency is through education. Hotels need to educate customers about revenue management and how pricing works. Customers who understand these processes are more likely to appreciate the hotel's pricing strategies, lower prices, and discounts. Customers who know that they are getting a good deal are more likely to remain loyal and recommend the hotel to other people.
Hotels can also optimize revenue management by integrating their customer relationship management strategies. By doing this, they can ensure customer loyalty is not compromised. Hotels must provide customers with a personalized experience to keep them coming back. Personalization is made possible through a range of technological and data-driven solutions, including the use of customer data systems (CRMs).
CRMs enable hotels to manage customer data efficiently and get insights into customer preferences and behaviors. For example, hotels can use CRM data to offer tailored promotions and loyalty programs to customers. These programs help in engaging customers, increasing their satisfaction and promoting loyalty. Hotels can use their CRM data to segment customers into groups, offering different types of promotions, discounts, and experiences based on the customers' preferences and behaviors.
Another way to integrate revenue management with customer relationship management is by offering customer loyalty programs, offering exclusive deals, discounts, and benefits for members. This move will attract more customers and keep the hotel at the forefront of customer's minds when looking for accommodation options.
In conclusion, revenue management is a crucial aspect of the hospitality industry, helping hotels optimize revenue by adjusting prices, managing inventory, and forecasting demand. Revenue management has many advantages to hotels, such as optimizing prices according to different customer segments. However, there are also issues that surround this practice, such as price discrimination and customers' perception of quality. Hotels must ensure that their revenue management practices are perceived as fair and reasonable by all types of customers by providing transparency, educating customers, and integrating customer relationship management strategies, in particular through customer loyalty programs. With these tactics, hotels can optimize their revenue management and maintain customer loyalty, making them competitive in the industry.
