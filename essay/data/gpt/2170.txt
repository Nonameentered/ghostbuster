In Catullus' poetry, love appears as a complex and often troubling experience. The characters involved are entangled in relationships full of contradictions, where the ideal and the real are often drastically different. More specifically, marriage and friendship relationships reveal the two-facedness of love, its ability to shift from an idealized version of itself to a frustrating and sometimes painful everyday reality. Catullus' use of marriage in his poems showcases beautifully how he emphasizes the gap between the ideal and the actual experience of love.
To begin with, it is critical to understand the cultural context of Catullus' poetry. Roman society highly valued marriage as a social institution, and marriage was often seen as a duty to produce legitimate children and secure family honor. At the same time, Roman men widely practiced extra-marital affairs and prostitutes were frequent in Rome. Thus, the contradictions of Roman marriage are apparent in Catullus' poem. He highlights the idealized vision of marriage and how it is contradicted by the real experience of it. For instance, in Poem 64, Catullus takes the mythical story of Jason and Medea to delineate the two sides of love and marriage. On the one hand, love brings a husband and wife together, creating a sense of romantic unity under the banner of marriage. Jason's pursuit of Medea and her eventual betrayal of her family for the sake of their love exemplify the quintessential passion of romance. They've bounded themselves by marriage, their passion, and commitment (Lines 27-30), creating an idealized notion of it. However, on the other hand, Catullus' poems also reveal the flip side of this romantic fantasy.
In Poem 64, for example, Jason abandons Medea, and this abandonment serves as a microcosm of the contradictions of marriage in Roman society, where marriage was often nothing more than a contract that ensured proper inheritance and property ownership. Such an experience undermined the idealized Roman notion of marriage and revealed the treacherous nature of relationships. Thus, it is evident that Catullus is highly critical of the social order that engenders such contradictions, hypocrisy and falsehood at the heart of marriage. As a result, he uses the myths of love and marriage to create an ironic gap between ideal and reality to highlight the many two-faced aspects of love relationships.
Beyond marriage, Catullus also shows that father-son relationships undergo the same contradictions between the ideal and the actual. In Poem 68, Catullus shows a father of a son who has died by suicide. The father stands in front of Altars seeking revenge against his own son. The irony here is self-evident: a supposed sign of love and respect, the relationship between father and son has gone so awry that revenge has replaced all else. Through the gap between the idealization of father-son relationship versus the reality of that relationship, Catullus shows the two-faced nature of love relationships. The father wants to see revenge, but the son is already dead. This gap between hope and reality is a common theme throughout Catullus' poems. The idealization of familial relationships and the dissonance created by the realities of life in Roman society embody the poet's criticism of that society itself.
Apart from marriage and familial relationships, Catullus also examines the contrasting nature of male friendships. In Poem 16, a friendship between two males is depicted as a tension between ideals and realities, the pure and the dirty, and the friendship is cast in erotic terms, serving to emphasize the two-facedness of love relationships. Catullus shows how a male friendship can be picked apart by imperfections and desires. In particular, he shows that male-female eroticism can pollute and corrupt male friendships. In this way, Catullus speaks to very real concerns about the workings of human passion, highlighting the fragile and contradictory nature of love in its many forms.
In conclusion, Catullus' poetry showcases how love relationships can transform over time, how they can shift between the ideal and the frustratingly real. He takes the idealized version of relationships, such as marriage, family, and friendship, and contrasts them with the contradictory experience of living with them. In the process, he criticizes the many two-faced aspects of love and its relationship with Roman society. His poetic discourse on the gap between the idealized vision of love and its real-life experience is provocative and shiningly honest, highlighting the often-unexplored depths of human passion. Through this, Catullus serves as a reminder of the deep psychological and social truths that love relationships embody, and how those relationships are governed by "two-faces" that may never be fully reconciled.
