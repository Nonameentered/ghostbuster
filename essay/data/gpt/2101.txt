Politics has always been an interesting subject for linguistic analysis. As politicians speak publicly, they engage with different speech acts to communicate their messages with the audience. Language plays an important role in achieving their communicative ends, and the pronoun usage is one particular aspect of linguistic variation that is in high use in the political context. This essay will explore the research question and methodology used in examining the use of first-person singular and first-person plural pronouns in British political speeches compared to a larger corpus, and the results of the analysis.
Research Question
The research question that is explored in this study relates to the usage of the first-person pronouns in political speeches and aims to investigate how British politicians use first-person singular and first-person plural pronouns in their speeches compared to a larger text corpus. The study seeks to answer three critical questions related to the use of first-person pronouns in political speeches. First, what is the frequency of usage of first-person singular and first-person plural pronouns in political speeches? Secondly, what is the distribution of these pronouns across political party affiliations? Thirdly, what is the pattern of usage of these pronouns in different speech contexts, such as during election campaigns or parliamentary debates?
Methodology
The methodology used in this study involves a corpus-based approach to analyze the use of first-person pronouns in political speeches. The corpus was compiled from speeches made by British politicians across different political party affiliations, including Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrats, and UKIP. The speeches were collected from the official party websites, newspapers reports on speeches, speeches delivered during parliamentary debates, and speeches given during election campaigns. The speeches were selected based on their availability and relevance to the research questions. The corpus included a total of 120 speeches, comprising 43 speeches from Conservative party politicians, 39 from Labour party, 20 from Liberal Democrats, and 18 from UKIP.
For comparative purposes, a larger corpus consisting of general text material was also compiled for analysis. The comparison corpus comprised a total of 1,200,000 words drawn from newspaper articles and academic journals. The general text material was selected to represent a range of topics and perspectives to provide a broader context for examining the use of first-person pronouns in British political speeches.
To analyze the data, the study used two main techniques. First, the study used concordance analysis to explore the frequency of usage of first-person pronouns in the political speeches corpus. The study extracted the first-person singular pronouns (I, me, my, mine) and first-person plural pronouns (we, us, our, ours) for analysis. The concordance analysis was done using AntConc, a software tool used for corpus analysis. Second, the study used the Chi-square test to examine the distribution of first-person pronouns across political affiliations and speech contexts.
Results
The results of the study show that British politicians use first-person singular and first-person plural pronouns at different frequencies in their speeches. The analysis of the political speeches corpus shows that the first-person singular pronouns appeared more frequently than first-person plural pronouns. In total, the corpus contained 1,679 first-person singular pronouns and 1,190 first-person plural pronouns.
The study also found a significant variation in the distribution of first-person pronouns across different political affiliations. Conservative politicians used first-person singular pronouns more than any other group, followed by Labour, Liberal Democrats, and UKIP. The Liberals and UKIP used the first-person plural pronouns more than any other group, while Labour and Conservatives used less frequently. These findings indicate that certain political parties tend to use different types of narrative styles in their speeches, depending on the political ideology they represent.
Another important finding is that the frequency of first-person singular pronouns in political speeches increased during election campaigns compared to other speech contexts. The analysis shows that the frequency of first-person singular pronouns in election campaigns was the highest, followed by parliamentary debates and political rallies. In contrast, the frequency of first-person plural pronouns was lower during election campaigns than in other contexts.
Finally, the study found that the use of first-person plural pronouns in British political speeches is significantly lower than in general text material from newspapers and academic journals. In the comparison corpus, the frequency of first-person plural pronouns was three times higher than in the political speeches corpus, reflecting a difference in narrative styles used in different text types.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the study explored the research question related to the use of first-person singular and first-person plural pronouns in British political speeches, the methodology used for the analysis, and the results of the analysis. The study revealed that British politicians use first-person pronouns in different frequencies and styles across different political affiliations and speech contexts. The findings highlight the role of language in political communication, and how the use of language can convey different narrative styles depending on the political ideology and context. Future research can build on the findings of this study by exploring the role of other linguistic features in political speeches, such as metaphor, rhetoric, and discourse markers.
