Assessing food intake over a five-day period aimed to provide a comprehensive and accurate measurement of a person's diet. This includes not only the quantity but also the quality of food consumed. By recording food intake for five days, it eliminates the bias of one day's food selection. The Bomb calorimeter was used to determine the gross energy content of a biscuit sample by burning the sample in a chamber with oxygen and measuring the heat release. The heat released was then multiplied by an appropriate conversion factor to calculate the gross energy content. This provides an accurate measurement of the energy content of the food item, which is essential in determining the nutritional value of a diet.
