In 1953, Edward Tatum and George Beadle conducted an experiment to establish the order of important genes in amino acid metabolism and sugar catabolism. The aim of the experiment was to determine the sequence of steps in metabolic pathways of Neurospora crassa, a bread mold. The researchers used a combination of classical genetic techniques such as mutagenesis, conjugation, and selective media to determine the order of the genes involved in these metabolic pathways.
The experiment had two main parts, which included establishing the order of genes involved in amino acid metabolism and sugar catabolism. In the first part of the experiment, Tatum and Beadle used X-rays to mutate the N. crassa cells, which resulted in several auxotrophic mutants that could only grow on media supplemented with specific amino acids. Using these mutants, the researchers were able to deduce that each mutant strain lacked the ability to synthesize a specific amino acid because of mutations in specific genes. Thus, by analyzing the ability of different mutant strains to grow on different media, the researchers were able to establish the order of genes involved in amino acid metabolism.
In the second part of the experiment, Tatum and Beadle used another genetic technique known as conjugation to establish the sequence of genes involved in sugar catabolism. They first identified two strains of N. crassa that could not independently grow on minimal media, but could grow together on the same media. One of the stains was deficient in the ability to metabolize arabinose sugar while the other was deficient in the ability to metabolize xylose sugar. The researchers then used a fine tungsten wire to join the two cells of different stains and left them to mate overnight. The conjugation resulted in the formation of diploid cells that contained both sets of genetic information.
The diploid cells were plated on selective media that contained both arabinose and xylose sugars, as well as nalidixic acid. Nalidixic acid was included to prevent the growth of any non-conjugated parent cells and to select for the growth of only the transformed cells. The selective media allowed only the diploid cells that had both genes for sugar catabolism to grow. By analyzing the different combinations of sugars metabolized, the researchers were able to establish the order of genes involved in sugar catabolism.
The results of this experiment were groundbreaking as they established the “one gene-one enzyme” theory, which suggested that each gene codes for a specific enzyme that catalyzes a specific metabolic pathway. However, the researchers were surprised to observe that some genes could code for multiple enzymes that catalyze different reactions in the same pathway. This observation led to the modification of the “one gene-one enzyme” theory to the “one gene-one polypeptide” theory, which suggests that each gene codes for a specific polypeptide that can contain multiple enzymatic activities.
The conjugation process was carried out by physically joining the cells of the different strains using a fine tungsten wire. The purpose of including nalidixic acid in the selective plates and sample preparation salts medium was to prevent the growth of any non-conjugated parent cells and to select for the growth of only the transformed cells. Nalidixic acid is a DNA gyrase inhibitor that targets gram-negative bacteria, which are present in the N. crassa microbiome. Therefore, including nalidixic acid in the media allowed only the transformed cells to grow and eliminated any background noise from non-conjugated parent cells.
In conclusion, the aim of the experiment conducted by Tatum and Beadle was to establish the order of genes involved in amino acid metabolism and sugar catabolism using classical genetic techniques such as mutagenesis, conjugation, and selective media. The results of the experiment established the “one gene-one enzyme” theory and led to the discovery of the “one gene-one polypeptide” theory. The conjugation process was carried out by physically joining the cells of different strains using a fine tungsten wire and nalidixic acid was included in the media to prevent the growth of non-conjugated parent cells and to select for the growth of only the transformed cells. This experiment paved the way for advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of metabolic pathways and continues to influence current research in genetics and molecular biology.
