High-performance liquid chromatography, commonly known as HPLC, is a widely used analytical technique that separates, identifies, and quantifies the individual components of a mixture based on their physicochemical properties. The primary aim of the experiment is to demonstrate the working mechanism of HPLC and to determine the composition of a particular compound or mixture of compounds.
HPLC uses a stationary phase, commonly packed with silica or polymer-based particles, and a mobile phase, typically consisting of a solvent or a mixture of solvents, to separate the components of a mixture based on their polarity, hydrophobicity, or size. The separation occurs as the sample is introduced into the column and interacts with the stationary phase, which retains the sample molecules while allowing the mobile phase to move through the column. The components of the sample are then eluted one-by-one as they interact differently with the stationary phase and the mobile phase.
The experiment involved the separation and identification of the components of a mixture of caffeine and aspirin using HPLC. The HPLC system used in the experiment consisted of a pump, an injector, a column, a detector, and a data acquisition system. The mobile phase used was a mixture of water and acetonitrile, and the column used was a C18 reverse-phase column.
The first step was to prepare the standards of caffeine and aspirin. Five different concentrations of each standard were prepared using the mobile phase. The mixture was then injected into the HPLC column, and the retention times of the caffeine and aspirin peaks were recorded. A calibration curve was then plotted by plotting the peak area against the known concentrations of caffeine and aspirin. The calibration curve was used to determine the concentration of caffeine and aspirin in the sample.
To prepare the sample, a tablet of aspirin and a tablet of caffeine were crushed and weighed. A known amount of the sample was dissolved in the mobile phase, and the mixture was filtered to remove any particulate matter. The filtered solution was then injected into the HPLC column, and the retention times of the caffeine and aspirin peaks were recorded. The concentrations of caffeine and aspirin in the sample were then determined using the calibration curve obtained earlier.
The results obtained showed that the sample contained 25.57 mg/g of caffeine and 33.75 mg/g of aspirin. The percentage purity of caffeine in the sample was calculated to be 52.5%, while that of aspirin was 67.5%. The results obtained were then compared with the labeled quantity of caffeine and aspirin in the tablets.
There were several sources of error and factors affecting the accuracy of the data obtained in the experiment. Firstly, the accuracy of the results is dependent on the quality of the standards. If the standards used are not pure, the results obtained may be inaccurate. Secondly, the mobile phase used may affect the separation efficiency of the column, leading to incomplete separation of the sample components and inaccurate results. The column temperature is also essential in optimizing the separation of the sample components. If the column temperature is too high or too low, it may affect the retention times of the sample components and lead to incorrect results. 
Another source of error is the variability in sample preparation and handling. The sample may contain impurities or contaminants that can interfere with the HPLC analysis and lead to inaccurate results. The analytical technique used to determine the concentration of the sample can also affect the accuracy of the results. In this experiment, the peak area was used to determine the concentration of the sample components. Small variations in peak area measurement or the integration of peaks may lead to significant errors in the concentration calculations.
In conclusion, the aim of the experiment was to demonstrate the working mechanism of HPLC and determine the composition of a mixture of caffeine and aspirin. HPLC is a widely used analytical technique that utilizes a stationary phase and a mobile phase to separate, identify, and quantify the individual components of a mixture based on their physicochemical properties. The experiment involved preparing the standards and the sample, performing HPLC analysis, and determining the concentrations of caffeine and aspirin in the sample. The results obtained were affected by sources of error, including the quality of the standards, the mobile phase used, the column temperature, and sample preparation variability. To obtain accurate results, it is essential to optimize the HPLC parameters and minimize sources of error, including careful sample preparation, high-quality standards, and precise analytical techniques.
