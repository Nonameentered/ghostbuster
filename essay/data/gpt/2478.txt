Biomass is the organic matter derived from plants and animals, which can be converted into usable forms of energy such as electricity, heat, and fuel. Biomass is a renewable source of energy as it can be replenished by the growth of organic material. It contributes to global primary energy use by providing an alternative to non-renewable resources such as coal and oil. Biomass is the largest source of renewable energy, accounting for 10% of global primary energy use. 
Mankind's intervention of the natural biomass system affects the carbon cycle and climate change. The carbon cycle involves the exchange of carbon between living organisms, the atmosphere, and the ocean. Burning biomass releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Additionally, deforestation, which is necessary for biomass production, removes trees that would otherwise absorb and store carbon dioxide. This increases the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, causing further climate change. 
To mitigate the negative effects of using biomass as an energy source, sustainable solutions should be explored. Using agricultural waste, such as straw and husks, and forestry waste, such as branches and twigs, for biomass production reduces the need for deforestation. Additionally, using energy crops, such as switchgrass and willow, that can be grown on non-arable land can provide renewable energy without the negative effects of land-use change. Furthermore, advanced biofuels technology, such as production from algae and waste products, can reduce emissions by improving the efficiency of biomass conversion. 
In conclusion, biomass is a valuable source of renewable energy that contributes to global primary energy use. However, the negative effects of mankind's intervention in the natural biomass system must be addressed to mitigate its negative impact on the carbon cycle and climate change. Sustainable solutions, such as using agricultural and forestry waste and energy crops, and developing advanced biofuels technologies, can help ensure that biomass remains a viable energy source in the future.
