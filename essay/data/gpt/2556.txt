Love is a topic that has captivated the imaginations of writers throughout history. Two such writers, Virgil and Propertius, are no exception, exploring the complexities of love in their works. Virgil, the famous Roman poet, and Propertius, one of the great elegy poets of the Augustan era, both delve into the fraught nature of love in their writing. In this essay, I will examine how Virgil and Propertius portray love in their works, with particular focus on how Virgil presents love as a destructive force through his depiction of the doomed romance between Dido and Aeneas. I will also analyze how Propertius' subversive stance elevates the powerful and dangerous effects of love on the individual.
Virgil's depiction of love in the Aeneid is both nuanced and complex. At times, Virgil romanticizes love, such as when Aeneas is portrayed as "burning with desire" for the unattainable Dido. However, Virgil ultimately stresses the negative consequences of love. This is evident in his tragic portrayal of the relationship between Aeneas and Dido, which is a textbook example of how love can be a destructive force. When Aeneas first arrives in Carthage, Dido, the queen of the city, immediately falls in love with him and does everything in her power to keep him there with her. She throws lavish parties and feasts, gives him gifts, and tries to convince him that he should forget his duty to found a new city in Italy and stay with her in Carthage instead.
The tragedy of Aeneas and Dido's relationship comes in large part from their different goals and desires. Aeneas is destined to found a new city in Italy, and everything he does is driven by this goal. Dido, on the other hand, is driven by her love for Aeneas and her desire to keep him by her side. When Aeneas finally decides that he must leave Carthage and continue his journey, Dido is heartbroken and consumed by despair. She even contemplates suicide, saying " Shall I, then, die unavenged? But let me die!/ Thus, thus I'll go, my lord, to meet thee in the sky" (IV.705-706). Ultimately, the relationship between Aeneas and Dido ends in tragedy; Dido kills herself and Aeneas goes on to found the city of Rome, but never forgets the love he once had for Dido.
By portraying love as a destructive force, Virgil seems to be highlighting the importance of duty over personal desire. For Virgil, duty is something that must be fulfilled, regardless of personal cost. Aeneas ultimately chooses duty over love, but this choice comes at a great price, as he must live with the knowledge that his actions led to the tragic death of his lover. In this way, Virgil's portrayal of love can be seen as a reflection of Augustan social norms, which valued duty and responsibility over the whims of individual desire.
In contrast to Virgil's tragic portrayal of love, Propertius' work often takes a subversive stance on love, emphasizing its dangerous and powerful effects. In one of his poems typical of his style, "Elegy 3.11," Propertius speaks of the destruction that love can cause, using his own tumultuous love affair as an example. He writes, "I've lived unthinkingly, and feel the pain/Of having struggled to chain the lightning" (3.11.1-2). Here, love is portrayed as a destructive force that is difficult to control, much like a bolt of lightning.
Propertius' work is known for its subversive stance, and this is evident in how he portrays love. He is critical of the idealized love portrayed in the poetry of his contemporaries, instead emphasizing the power that love has to disrupt and cause chaos in the lives of individuals. In "Elegy 3.11," Propertius laments the destruction that love has wrought in his own life, saying "a wound that's concealed is more powerful than one that's revealed" (3.11.11-12). Here, he suggests that the hidden pain caused by love is often more powerful than the pain that is openly expressed.
Propertius' subversive stance on love can be seen as a challenge to Augustan social norms, which valued stability and order above all else. Propertius, like many of the Augustan poets, was concerned with the idea of amor, or passionate love, and its effects on individuals. By highlighting the dangers of love, he was challenging the societal norms that placed duty and responsibility above personal desire.
In conclusion, Virgil and Propertius both explore the complexities of love in their works, with Virgil emphasizing its destructive potential and Propertius taking a subversive stance. Through his depiction of the tragic relationship between Aeneas and Dido, Virgil portrays the dangers of love when personal desire conflicts with duty. Propertius, on the other hand, challenges the Augustan social norms that valued duty and responsibility over individual desire, emphasizing the powerful and often harmful effects that love can have on the individual. Ultimately, both writers offer nuanced and complex portrayals of love that continue to captivate and resonate with readers to this day.
