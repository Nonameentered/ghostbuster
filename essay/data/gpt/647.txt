Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition that affects the hand and wrist. It is caused by compression of the median nerve that runs from the forearm to the hand through the carpal tunnel. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passageway located on the palm side of the wrist that is formed by the bones of the wrist and a ligament.
One case of carpal tunnel syndrome was that of a 40-year-old female administrative assistant who complained of intermittent numbness and tingling sensation in her right hand and fingers. The symptoms were worse at night and caused her to wake up frequently. She had no history of trauma or injury to her wrist or hand. However, her job required her to type on a computer keyboard for several hours daily.
The patient was referred to a hand specialist who conducted several tests to diagnose carpal tunnel syndrome. The first test was Tinel's sign, which involved tapping the median nerve in the wrist to check for any tingling or numbness. The second test was Phalen's test, which involved flexing the wrist for 60 seconds to check for any symptoms. The third test was the two-point discrimination test, which involved measuring the patient's ability to distinguish between two points on the hand.
Her hand specialist then ordered an electromyogram (EMG) to confirm the diagnosis. The EMG involved inserting fine needles into the muscles of the hand and forearm to assess the functioning of the median nerve. The test showed reduced nerve conduction velocity, confirming the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome.
The patient was then scheduled for surgical management, which involved a carpal tunnel release. The procedure was performed under local anesthesia, and a small incision was made in the wrist. The ligament that forms the roof of the carpal tunnel was cut to relieve the pressure on the median nerve. The incision was then closed with sutures.
After the surgery, the patient reported immediate improvement in her symptoms. The numbness and tingling sensation in her hand and fingers disappeared, and she was able to sleep better at night. She was advised to rest her hand for a few days and perform exercises to strengthen her hand and wrist.
If left untreated, carpal tunnel syndrome can lead to permanent damage to the median nerve, resulting in weakness, loss of grip strength, and atrophy of the muscles in the hand. It can also cause chronic pain and interfere with daily activities. Therefore, it is essential to seek timely medical attention and undergo appropriate diagnostic tests to confirm the diagnosis and receive appropriate treatment.
In conclusion, carpal tunnel syndrome is a common condition that affects the hand and wrist. The diagnostic process involves several tests, including Tinel's sign, Phalen's test, two-point discrimination test, and electromyogram. Surgical management, such as carpal tunnel release, can provide significant relief from the symptoms and prevent long-term complications. It is vital to seek medical attention and undergo appropriate treatment to avoid permanent damage to the median nerve and other associated consequences of leaving carpal tunnel syndrome untreated.
