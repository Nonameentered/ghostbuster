Introduction
Economic cooperation is the collaboration of countries to enhance economic growth, development, and integration. The East Asia region has been a subject of interest regarding economic cooperation for the past decades due to the prospects of an economic power bloc. However, despite the ample opportunities for cooperation, institutionalization has been slow, and regionalism remains weak. This paper analyses the internal and external factors that have affected the institutionalization of economic cooperation in East Asia. The paper also discusses how realist approaches, economic disparity, and political antipathy have prevented successful progress in cooperative institutionalization in the region. Lastly, the paper recommends possible solutions to the challenges faced and how to hasten economic cooperation in East Asia. 
Internal and External Factors that have Affected Slow Progress in Institutionalization of Economic Cooperation in East Asia
East Asian Countries have a unique mix of economic, political, and cultural factors that have impacted cooperative institutionalization efforts in the region. Internal factors include economic growth, domestic political systems, culture, nationalism, and regionalism. However, external factors such as international trade frameworks, global economic shocks, and geopolitical influences add complex dynamics to the institutionalization of economic cooperation in East Asia. 
One significant internal factor that has affected the slow progress of institutionalization is nationalism. The region's cultural identity and history of conflicts reflect the difficulty in fostering a shared identity of economic cooperation. Nationalism poses a threat to deeper integration and has sometimes been used to justify trade barriers and bilateral relationships, which undermine the regional economic cooperation. 
Economic disparities between rich and poor nations in East Asia have also curtailed regionalism initiatives. Unlike in the European Union, the income disparities between countries in the region are large, which raises implementation challenges for regional policies and programs. Discrepancies in institutions, infrastructure, human capital, and governance have caused disparities in interest and capacity, which adversely impacted the institutionalization of economic cooperation. 
The third internal factor impacting institutionalization is political antipathy. Despite the prospects of economic gains, favor has sometimes been given to political and security benefits over economic gains. Disagreements and distrust between countries have often led to the failure of plans and negotiations. It is necessary to overcome various political hurdles among nations in the region for them to reach a common ground and work towards mutual benefit. 
Similarly, external factors like global economic shocks have impeded cooperation. The 1997 Asian financial crisis had a significant impact on the region. The crisis resulted in Asian countries reducing their reliance on exporting to their markets, which worsened the economic disparity across the region. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic setbacks for countries and reduced the capacity to allocate resources to regional initiatives. 
Realist approaches have also played a critical role in the slow progress of institutionalization. Realism promotes the political and strategic interests of states, which sometimes competes with economic cooperation interests. Realists view integration as a tool of hegemony, which reduces intentional cooperation efforts. When a country assumes that their interest comes first before others, this creates a lack of trust among the partner states.
Realist Approaches, Economic Disparity, and Political Antipathy in Preventing Successful Progress of Cooperative Institutionalization in the Region
Realist Approaches
A realist approach to international relations prioritizes states' national interests above other considerations. Cooperation is therefore primarily a tool of economic power for the interested parties, instead of genuine interest in regional integration. This view creates suspicion among countries trying to integrate, limiting effective cooperation. 
The realist approach is evidenced by instances of trade wars in the region. The trade dispute between China and the US had a worldwide economic impact, and it reduced regional integration progress. The two economic giants engaged in a tariff trade war, which halted economic cooperation efforts and dismantled collaborative initiatives. 
Economic Disparity
The economic disparity between countries remains a significant challenge in the region. Countries with more significant economies have more significant capabilities than others, making it difficult to deepen regional economic integration. Economic disparities have made it possible for some countries to dominate the region's economy, limiting collaborative policies that can benefit the region as a whole.
The economic disparity is evidenced by the political and economic circumstances in countries like North Korea, Mongolia, and Myanmar. These countries have minimal resources that inhibit their abilities to participate in regional economic efforts. 
Political Antipathy
Political antipathy is the absence of agreement between countries that are attempting to institutionalize economic cooperation. Political engagement is an essential element of regional cooperation. Issues of territorial disputes, rivalries, historical biases, and geopolitical tensions continue to sabotage economic cooperation. 
One exemplary case of political antipathy is the relationship between Japan and Korea. The two countries have had a long-standing rivalry, affected by historical, territorial, and security issues. This rivalry has halted bilateral negotiations, limiting the scope for economic cooperation. 
What can be done to Eliminate These Obstacles and Hasten Economic Cooperation in East Asia?
To hasten economic cooperation in East Asia, countries must address issues that inhibit cooperation. The following are possible solutions to the obstacles of nationalism, economic disparity, political antipathy, and realist approaches. 
Nationalism
Nationalism is a significant internal challenge to economic cooperation in East Asia. It is essential to recognize that the region's culture is a unique aspect that can contribute to economic cooperation, rather than work against it. Nationalistic tendencies that undermine regionalism need to be addressed by policy solutions that foster a shared identity of common interests in the region. 
Economic Disparity
Countries that are more economically advanced must have policy interventions that support the development of the countries struggling. This can entail mechanisms that offer technical assistance, education, and skill acquisition programs. Addressing economic disparities involves the transfer of knowledge, which usually results in economic growth, employment generation, and poverty alleviation. 
Political Antipathy
Political antipathy has a profound impact on economic cooperation. Governments must establish confidence-building measures aimed at building trust among nations. It is crucial to address the root problem that leads to political antipathy, which is often territorial disputes and geopolitical tensions. When political antipathy issues are addressed, countries can work towards common goals, and economic cooperation can be established. 
Realist approaches
A cooperative institutionalization approach would increase the trust factor among countries. The promotion of economic interdependence, transparency, and increased dialogue would encourage states to leave behind realist approaches, reducing competitive tendencies in matters of trade and commerce. There is no possibility of success for cooperation through force or coercion, only through voluntary participation. The promotion of mutually beneficial agreements is key. 
Conclusion
The institutionalization of economic cooperation in East Asia has been hindered by different internal and external factors. This paper discussed how the obstacles of nationalism, economic disparity, political antipathy, and realist approaches have slowed progress in the region. In addressing these obstacles, nations in the region can cooperate to resolve mutual challenges of economic growth, development, and integration. Addressing these challenges is a critical factor for the successful institutionalization of economic cooperation in East Asia.
