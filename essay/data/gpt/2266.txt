Introduction
The Charpy Impact Test is a widely used method to measure the toughness of materials, especially steels. The test measures the amount of energy needed to fracture a sample and the ductile to brittle transition temperature of the sample. It is important to understand how temperature, carbon content, and heat treatment affect the toughness of steel and how this information can be used to select the appropriate material for a certain application.
The Charpy Impact Test
The Charpy Impact Test involves striking a notched sample of the material with a hammer to calculate the amount of energy needed to fracture it. The sample is placed in a fixture with the notch facing towards the hammer, which then rotates to raise the hammer to a specified height. The hammer is released to strike the sample, and the resulting energy is recorded with a scale. The test calculates the amount of energy needed to fracture the sample, which represents the toughness of the material.
Ductile to Brittle Transition Behavior
The ductile to brittle transition temperature is the temperature where the behavior of the material changes from ductile to brittle.  For steels, the change in behavior is due to the effects of temperature on the crystal structure of the metal. As the temperature decreases, the crystal structure changes and becomes more brittle.  The Charpy Impact Test can be used to measure the change in behavior in different steels as a function of temperature.
Factors Affecting Toughness
Temperature, carbon content, and heat treatment affect the toughness of steel. As the temperature increases, the toughness of steel decreases, and the ductile to brittle transition temperature shifts to higher values. High carbon content decreases toughness, as increased carbon reduces the amount of ductile material present in the metal. The effects of heat treatment on toughness can vary depending on the specific type of heat treatment applied.
Implications on Maximum Impact Energy
The maximum impact energy a steel can withstand is affected by these factors. Steels with high toughness can absorb more energy before failure than steels with lower toughness. Steel with a lower carbon content can absorb more energy because there is more ductile material present. Heat treatment can also affect maximum impact energy, as some heat treatments can cause embrittlement of the steel.
Implications on Material Selection
The investigation of steels using the Charpy Impact Test can help designers choose the appropriate material for their application. Data on toughness and the ductile to brittle transition temperature can aid in selecting the appropriate material for use at a specific temperature or in a specific environment. For example, a material with a low ductile to brittle transition temperature would be unsuitable for use in cold environments, as it may become brittle and fail. A material with high toughness would be more appropriate for use in applications where it may be subject to high impact loads.
Conclusion
The Charpy Impact Test is a valuable method to measure the toughness of metals, particularly steels. Understanding the effect of temperature, carbon content, and heat treatment on toughness and the ductile to brittle transition behavior of steel is important in selecting the appropriate material for a given application. The investigation of steels using the Charpy Impact Test can offer insights into the performance of materials in certain environments and aid in the selection of materials based on their maximum impact energy and ductile to brittle behavior.
