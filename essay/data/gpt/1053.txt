Parity conditions are the fundamental economic theories that coordinate the operation of international financial markets. These conditions are the cornerstones of financial market analysis, as they help to explain the behavior of various economic variables, such as interest rates, exchange rates, and inflation, in different regions across the globe. Specifically, parity conditions enforce an equilibrium in global financial markets, ensuring continuous arbitrage opportunities. There are numerous types of parity conditions, such as the law of one price, absolute purchasing power parity, and relative purchasing power parity, and each plays an essential role in analyzing international finance.
The theory of purchasing power parity (PPP) is a vital concept in international finance, as it compares goods and services costs between countries, thereby finding gaps in exchange rates. Specifically, the theory seeks to reconcile the exchange rate between two different currencies to their respective purchasing powers. In effect, purchasing power parity is an economic concept that suggests that the quantity of money needed to purchase goods or services in one country should be equal to that in any other country. Thus, whenever there is an underestimation of a currency's purchasing power, the theory suggests that there ought to be an upward correction of exchange rates to correspond with local costs. 
To further illustrate this concept, consider the following example. Suppose an ebook that is sold in the United States for $12.99 is also available for purchase in the United Kingdom for £8.99. If the exchange rate is $1.3 per £1, then the book's UK price should be $11.69 ($1.3*8.99), indicating a 10% difference in the exchange rate's expected purchasing power. Therefore, based on PPP theory, the U.S. dollar is overvalued by 10% against the UK pound, and the book's price is consequently different in the two jurisdictions.
However, the validity of PPP under real-world scenarios is a subject of contention, as the economic conditions necessary for PPP may not exist. PPP assumes that trade between two countries must extend to all goods and services, which doesn't always happen due to existing trade barriers and restrictions. Additionally, PPP assumes that certain requirements, such as transaction costs, taxes, and transportation costs, are constant across different countries or that they are incorporated in exchange rates. However, exchange rates don't always account for these factors. 
The Law of One Price (LOP) is an essential element of PPP, relating to the notion that, over time, the price of any international trade item should be identical in different markets. In economics, the LOP theory suggests that the price of a basket of goods must be the same in different geographies, when adjusted for currency exchange rates. In the absence of market segmentation, differences in prices may allow for arbitrage opportunities. In other words, if the price of a specific commodity is cheaper in one jurisdiction than it is in another jurisdiction, we would expect the arbitrage to balance these disparities until the LOP is achieved.
Therefore, whenever international markets have market imperfections, transactions costs, or other barriers to efficient market functioning, the prices of identical goods can vary from COUNTRY to COUNTRY. Based on LOP, when compared to PPP, the LOP theory is more comprehensive, as flows or investments can also impact exchange rate values. Nonetheless, LOP is an imperfect theory due to several factors, such as transaction costs, income distribution, and price differentiation.
Empirical evidence indicates that the PPP concept is indeed valid to forecast exchange rate movement. For instance, a study conducted by Rogoff (1996) revealed that PPP exhibits predictive capacity after long-period forecasts (30 years or more) and that the consequences were more precise when analyzing developed countries. Even so, it is suggested that PPP is better toned for the long run and can exhibit relevant momentary deviations from short-term price differentials.
Stationarity refers to a condition in which a probability distribution of an application remains stable over time. In short, stationarity is the probability of a process or a system remaining unchanged over time.
Regarding long-term exchange rate movements, PPP assumes that exchange rates converge towards their equilibria, resulting in exchange rate convergence, a state where there is no significant long-term trend in the exchange rate. However, this hypothesis is only valid under the condition of stationarity of the applicable economic variables. On the other hand, if stationarity does not exist in exchange market variables, PPP may not hold.
The existence of unit roots, which is the presence of non-stationarity, can challenge PPP validity. Therefore, the need arises to investigate the stationarity of international exchange rates the same way as other economic variables. If the variables concerned are deemed non-stationary, PPP may not be valid in the long run or may only be valid for specific timeframes.
PPP testing requires a range of analytical approaches, with the most extensively used being the unit root and cointegration tests. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, the Phillips-Perron (PP) test, and the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test are the most common examples of the unit root test. These models assess the stationarity of the time-series data used in the PPP analysis and tackle issues that various variables within the equation may show persistent deviations from their yearly or quarterly averages.
Cointegration analysis, also known as the Engle-Granger approach, is a method used to estimate PPP's validity by investigating whether two or more non-stationary time series variables form a stable or long-term relationship. The cointegration approach is an econometric method that examines the stability or long-term relationship between two non-stationary time series variables. It assumes that the relationship, or equilibrium, between two or more variables is not transitory but permanent.
In conclusion, parity conditions such as PPP play a vital role in international markets, serving as a guide for exchange rate behavior. While the validity of PPP and LOP is subject to scrutiny for specific ideal market conditions, empirical evidence indicates that these theories are indeed valuable in predicting long-term exchange rate trends. Therefore, stationarity and cointegration analyses play a crucial role in testing PPP's validity, given that it requires stable long-term relationships between non-stationary economic variables for the theory to hold.
