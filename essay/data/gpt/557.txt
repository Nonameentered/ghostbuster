Customary international law has been a cornerstone of the international legal system for centuries, and it remains an essential source of international law. Customary international law can, however, be a complicated and uncertain source of international law due to two core elements: state practice and opinio juris. Despite these inherent complications, custom remains a significant source of international law today, particularly in three key areas: international conventions, the use of force, and peremptory norms.
International Conventions: International conventions are agreements reached between states to create international law. They can take a variety of forms, such as treaties, protocols, and agreements. However, international conventions are only binding on states that have agreed to them through the process of ratification. Customary international law can play an important role in the formation and interpretation of international conventions, as it can provide a framework or common understanding of the norms and principles that underlie shared state behaviour. Customary international law can also be used to determine the scope and practical application of international conventions, which can help states to comply with their obligations.
The Use of Force: Customary international law can be particularly important in determining when states are allowed to use force in international relations. The UN Charter states that states may only use force in self-defence or with Security Council authorisation. However, the meaning of self-defence and the legitimacy of Security Council resolutions can be informed by customary international law. Customary international law might establish that an armed attack is required before self-defence is allowed, that anticipatory self-defence is permissible only in limited circumstances, and that Security Council authorisations must be taken seriously. Customary international law can also be used to assess the legality of specific uses of force, such as humanitarian interventions or pre-emptive strikes. Although breaches of customary international law might not have the same legal implications as breaching an international convention, they can have significant political and diplomatic consequences.
Peremptory Norms: Peremptory norms are a category of customary international law that are considered to be fundamental principles that create obligations for all states, regardless of whether they have consented to them. Examples of peremptory norms include prohibitions on genocide, slavery, torture, and aggression. These norms are of paramount importance to the international legal system and can justify the imposition of legal consequences, such as criminal sanctions or reparations for victims. Customary international law is often used to identify and establish peremptory norms, although the bar for creating a new peremptory norm is high and requires widespread acceptance and consistent state practice.
While the role of customary international law remains significant, there are problems with the two core elements of custom: state practice and opinio juris. State practice refers to how states behave or act in a particular way, while opinio juris refers to the belief of states that a particular practice or behaviour is required by international law. Establishing both state practice and opinio juris can be challenging, as it requires a clear and consistent pattern of behaviour that is widely accepted and seen as legally required. It can also be challenging to distinguish which elements of state behaviour reflect international law, as opposed to political or strategic considerations.
Soft law, such as United Nations Resolutions, can also have an impact on the formation and interpretation of customary international law. While soft law is not binding, it can be used to create expectations or norms of behaviour that can eventually become customary international law. United Nations Resolutions on topics such as climate change, child soldiers, and human rights have helped to create new international norms that have subsequently been reflected in customary international law.
In conclusion, despite its inherent complications and uncertainties, customary international law remains a significant source of international law today. It is particularly important in areas such as international conventions, the use of force, and the creation of peremptory norms. However, the problems with establishing state practice and opinio juris mean that it may be of limited importance in some areas or situations. Soft law can also have an impact on the formation and interpretation of customary international law. Ultimately, the role of customary international law will continue to evolve alongside the changing needs and priorities of the international legal system.
