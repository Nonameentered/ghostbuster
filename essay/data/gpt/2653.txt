Commercial polymers are widely used in different fields such as medicine, energy, and electronics among others. One type of these polymers is those with an inorganic backbone, such as cyclopolysiloxanes. There are various types of commercial polymers with an inorganic backbone, including polyphosphazenes, polysilazanes, and polyoxometalates to name a few. These polymers are produced through different methods, including polycondensation and ring-opening polymerization.
The production of cyclopolysiloxanes relies heavily on concentration. The concentration of the reactants affects the rate of the reaction and the size of the rings formed in the polymerization process. Low concentrations result in larger ring sizes, whereas high concentrations lead to smaller ring sizes. An experiment using dichlorodiphenylsilane demonstrated the effect of concentration on the ring size. Low concentrations of this compound led to the formation of large rings, whereas high concentrations resulted in the creation of smaller rings.
During the production of these polymers, impurities may be encountered due to contamination of the reactants or undesirable side reactions. For instance, the presence of moisture in the reactants can lead to the formation of oligomers, which are shorter than the desired polymer chains. Insufficient purification of the reactants can also introduce impurities into the final product, which can affect the performance of the polymer.
In conclusion, commercial polymers with an inorganic backbone play a crucial role in various fields. Cyclopolysiloxanes are one type of these polymers that rely on the concentration of the reactants for their production. However, impurities can affect the quality of the final product and must be minimized through appropriate purification.
