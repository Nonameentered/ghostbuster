Introduction 
Publishing industries have traditionally been considered to play a vital role in cultural conservation and gatekeeping. These industries have often been tasked with preserving works of literature, selecting authors to publish, and distributing these works to the wider audience. However, post-structuralist theory has proposed a significant challenge to this traditional role, arguing that the meaning and significance of literature are subjective and cannot be monopolized by the publishing industry. 
This essay will examine how post-structuralist theory challenges the traditional role of publishers as cultural gatekeepers and conservationists of literature. It will also discuss whether the publishing industry and its products can be reconciled with post-structuralism in our modern world. 
Post-Structuralist theory and the role of publishers 
Post-structuralist theory emerged in the late 1960s and 1970s as a response to structuralism. Structuralism was a theoretical approach that posited that human culture can be explained through underlying structures that can be uncovered through various techniques of interpretation. Post-structuralism, on the other hand, disavowed the idea of underlying structures and focused instead on the subjectivity of meaning. This theory argues that meaning is not fixed but is instead a product of various cultural forces and contexts that are constantly in flux. 
Post-structuralism challenges the traditional role of publishers as gatekeepers and preservers of culture in several ways. First, post-structuralists argue that meaning is not fixed but is instead subject to constant negotiation and reinterpretation. This means that the role of publishers in conserving literature is limited since the works they are trying to preserve can have different meanings to different readers depending on their individual context. This shows that the work of publishers in preserving texts as part of a cultural canon is an impossible task as there can never be a stable understanding of what can be considered 'timeless' literature. 
Second, post-structuralism emphasizes the importance of individual interpretation in the production of meaning. This emphasis on individual interpretation has further challenged the role of publishers, who are traditionally understood to play an important role in shaping how texts are understood. This is because according to post-structuralism, any individual can be considered an expert interpreter of a text, which then makes the role of the publisher in determining the meaning of a text moot. 
Finally, post-structuralism's critique of fixed meanings and focus on subjectivity has challenged the exclusivity and elitism of traditional publishing industries. By emphasizing the role of context in the production of meaning, post-structuralism has opened up the field of literature to include those whose voices have historically been excluded or marginalized, such as women, the working class, and minorities. This means that publishing becomes more inclusive, and the industry can no longer serve as a cultural gatekeeper in the traditional sense. 
Reconciliation between post-structuralism and the publishing industry 
The relationship between post-structuralism and the publishing industry is complex, and it is not clear if the two can be reconciled. One approach that has been proposed involves a shift in the way publishers engage with texts. This approach involves publishers treating texts as open-ended rather than fixed, which means that they allow readers to have a range of interpretations and actively engage with the text's meaning in their own way. This shift would require publishers to be more open to alternative voices and interpretations and would accommodate a diversity of perspectives on literature. 
Another approach involves the democratization of the publishing industry, whereby the industry is opened up to more diverse voices and perspectives. This would involve publishers actively seeking out and promoting works by authors from historically marginalized groups and potentially opening up space for alternative modes of publishing, such as self-publishing and online distribution. 
While these approaches offer a possible way forward, there are significant challenges to be addressed. For example, the shift towards an open-ended approach to text interpretation risks creating a lack of coherence and a loss of criteria by which works can be assessed. Additionally, the democratization of the publishing industry may require significant changes in the way the industry operates, which may be resisted by established publishers and their distribution channels. 
Conclusion 
Post-structuralist theory has fundamentally challenged the traditional role of publishers as cultural gatekeepers and conservationists of literature. This challenge is based on post-structuralism's emphasis on the subjective and open-ended nature of meaning and its potential for democratizing the production and interpretation of literary works. While there are challenges to reconciling post-structuralism with the publishing industry, finding a way forward that embraces these critiques offers an opportunity to create a more inclusive, diverse, and potentially transformative literary landscape.
