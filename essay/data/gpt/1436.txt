Slavery is a sensitive issue that has plagued human civilization for centuries. It arose from the idea that human beings could be owned and traded as property. Despite the abolishment of slavery in many countries, its remnants still linger today, and it remains a part of the collective memory. One of the ways through which this memory has found expression is in Romantic Literature, specifically in works such as Jane Austen's Mansfield Park and Olaudah Equiano's writings. These works delve into the theme of slavery through sublimation and disruption, which allows us as readers and audiences to acknowledge the issue without being overwhelmed by it.
Jane Austen's Mansfield Park is a novel that is primarily set in the British Regency period. It follows the story of Fanny Price, a young girl who grew up in a poor family and is subsequently adopted by her wealthy aunt and uncle. The novel explores themes such as marriage, social status, and power dynamics. However, the theme of slavery is also touched upon, albeit in a subtle way. At the time of the novel's setting, the transatlantic slave trade was still ongoing, and wealthy British aristocrats were among the beneficiaries. Sir Thomas Bertram, Fanny's uncle, is one of such aristocrats. The novel highlights the hypocrisy of the wealthy and powerful who espouse values of freedom and justice while simultaneously benefiting from slavery. Sir Thomas' wealth is built on the profits made from the slave trade, yet he is portrayed as a benevolent and just figure throughout the novel. Austen also does not shy away from pointing out the moral rot that can arise from benefiting from the suffering of others. The novel's antagonist, Mrs. Norris, shows that even well-meaning individuals can become corrupted by the mere association with slavery. She is shown to be callous and selfish, and her moral corruption is due in part to her association with Sir Thomas.
Another example of Romantic Literature that explores the theme of slavery is Olaudah Equiano's writings. Equiano was a former slave who penned one of the most popular slave narratives of the 18th century, titled "The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano." The book describes Equiano's experiences as a slave, his freedom, and his eventual travels across the Atlantic. The work is a powerful and graphic portrayal of the atrocities of slavery, and it describes in great detail the mistreatment of slaves and the conditions under which they lived. However, what sets Equiano's narrative apart is its use of sublimation and disruption to address the issue of slavery. Rather than merely describing the horrors of slavery, Equiano centers his narrative around his own life story, which emphasizes the humanity of slaves. He paints a vivid picture of himself as a young boy playing with friends and learning how to read in his village. By highlighting the commonalities between himself and his readers, he underscores the fact that slaves are human beings who have been denied their basic human rights. In this way, Equiano's narrative is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and a rebuke to the dehumanization of slavery.
In conclusion, the issue of slavery has found expression in Romantic Literature through the sublimation and disruption of the theme. Works such as Jane Austen's Mansfield Park and Olaudah Equiano's writings provide a window into the atrocities of slavery while also allowing us to appreciate the humanity of slaves and the moral decay that can arise from benefiting from their suffering. Slavery is a sensitive issue that continues to echo through the ages, and literature remains one of the most powerful tools we possess to engage with it.
