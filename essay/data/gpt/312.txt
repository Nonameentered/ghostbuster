The time consistency problem refers to the dilemma faced by policymakers in committing to an optimal monetary policy over time. It arises because the optimal policy path may change over time, but once a commitment to a policy is made, it may be difficult to modify it later. This problem is further compounded by the fact that the actions taken by policymakers may have different effects during different periods. The problem is particularly acute in the case of monetary policy, where it is well-known that there are significant lags between policy decisions and their effects on the economy.
One way to reduce the time consistency problem is to delegate monetary policy to an independent central bank. This approach has gained popularity over the past few decades and is now widely adopted by most major economies. Delegating monetary policy to an independent central bank involves giving the central bank the authority to set interest rates and control the money supply without interference from politicians or other parties. The rationale for this approach is that it reduces the incentive for policymakers to pursue short-term goals, such as stimulating the economy before an election, at the expense of long-term goals, such as inflation control.
The analytical framework developed by Kydland and Prescott and Barro and Gordon provides a theoretical basis for understanding why delegating monetary policy to an independent central bank can help to reduce the time consistency problem. According to the framework, there are two key factors that determine the time consistency of monetary policy: the policymaker's time horizon and the expectations of the public.
Kydland and Prescott argue that the optimal policy requires a long-term commitment to maintaining low inflation. However, in the absence of independent central banks, policymakers face the temptation to deviate from the optimal policy in the short run to benefit politically. This leads to higher inflation expectations, which in turn lead to higher inflation rates. Once this happens, a policy change is required to bring inflation back under control, which leads to output variability. This vicious circle creates a time inconsistency problem that is difficult to solve.
Barro and Gordon provide a similar explanation for the time consistency problem, but they highlight the importance of public expectations. They argue that the public's expectations about future inflation play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of monetary policy. In particular, if the public expects policymakers to pursue expansionary policies in the short run, this expectation will be incorporated into their economic behavior, leading to higher inflation. This, in turn, makes it more difficult for policymakers to maintain price stability in the long run.
Both frameworks suggest that delegating monetary policy to an independent central bank can help to reconcile the policy trade-offs between inflation and output variability. The idea is that by giving the central bank the freedom to set policy, it can focus on maintaining price stability in the long run, without being distracted by short-term political considerations. This, in turn, helps to anchor inflation expectations and reduce the likelihood of output variability.
The contribution of Rogoff's conservative policymaker is particularly relevant for understanding the potential trade-offs between inflation reduction and output variability. Rogoff argues that a conservative central banker who is committed to maintaining low inflation can help to reduce output variability in the short run as well. The reason is that if the public believes that the central bank is committed to low inflation, they will anticipate future monetary policy decisions and adjust their behavior accordingly. This reduces the need for the central bank to make frequent policy changes and leads to greater output stability.
However, there is a potential trade-off between inflation reduction and output variability. If the central bank is overly conservative, it may sacrifice output stability in the short run for the sake of inflation reduction in the long run. This can lead to higher unemployment and slower economic growth. Therefore, the optimal strategy for central banks is to strike a balance between price stability and output variability, taking into account the specific economic conditions prevailing in each country.
Empirical evidence suggests that there is a strong relationship between central bank independence and conservativeness. A study by Cukierman et al. (1992) showed that central bank independence is positively correlated with inflation control, suggesting that delegating monetary policy to an independent central bank can help to reduce inflation. Similarly, a study by Alesina and Summers (1993) found that independent central banks are more likely to pursue conservative monetary policies than those that are subject to political interference.
However, there is also evidence to suggest that greater central bank independence can lead to higher output variability. For example, a study by Blinder and Reis (2005) found that independent central banks in the US and the EU were less effective in stabilizing output during the 2008 financial crisis than those that were subject to political pressures. This suggests that while central bank independence is important for reducing inflation, it may not always be beneficial for output stability.
In conclusion, the time consistency problem is a major challenge facing policymakers in the formulation of monetary policy. Delegating monetary policy to an independent central bank is one way to mitigate this problem by reducing the incentive for policymakers to pursue short-term goals at the expense of long-term goals. The analytical frameworks developed by Kydland and Prescott, Barro and Gordon, and Rogoff provide a theoretical basis for understanding why delegating monetary policy to an independent central bank can help to reduce the time consistency problem. However, there is a potential trade-off between inflation reduction and output variability, and the optimal strategy for central banks is to strike a balance between the two, taking into account the specific economic conditions prevailing in each country. Empirical evidence suggests that there is a strong relationship between central bank independence and conservativeness, but central bank independence may not always be beneficial for output stability.
