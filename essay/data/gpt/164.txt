In A Midsummer Night's Dream and Plato's Republic, two different views on truth are presented. Both authors explore the idea of truth as an essential aspect of the human experience, but they differ in their understanding of what truth is and how it interacts with our lives. In Shakespeare's play, truth is presented as a subjective and elusive concept, while in Plato's Republic, truth is seen as objective and external to human experience. These contrasting views have a significant impact on how the authors approach poetry and the arts.
Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream portrays a world where truth is subjective and difficult to pin down. The play is filled with multiple layers of deception and illusion, where characters constantly misunderstand each other's motives, emotions, and intentions. The most notable example of this subjective view of truth is embodied in the character of Puck, the mischievous fairy who delights in playing tricks on mortals and causing confusion. Puck's famous line, "What fools these mortals be!" (Act III, Scene 2), attests to the play's underlying premise that love, desire, and magic all conspire to blur the lines between truth and falsehood. The fairies' world, with its shifting identities and fluid boundaries, challenges the notion of truth as something absolute or objective.
Shakespeare's conception of truth also allows for the possibility of multiple truths, each of which has its own validity. This is exemplified in the contrasting stories of the four lovers: Hermia, Lysander, Demetrius, and Helena. Each of them has their own version of the truth, and their stories intersect and overlap in complex ways. For instance, while Lysander and Hermia believe they are in love with each other, Demetrius and Helena's love is much less reciprocal. This multiplicity of truths suggests that truth is not a fixed or immutable entity but rather something that is contingent upon our experiences, perspectives, and emotions.
Plato's Republic, on the other hand, presents a very different view of truth. For Plato, truth is not something that is subjective or relative to our individual experiences but rather something that exists outside of ourselves and can be accessed through reason and philosophy. Plato's famous allegory of the cave illustrates this point. In this allegory, people are chained in a cave and can only see the shadows of objects projected on the wall. They mistake these shadows for reality and are unaware of the true nature of the world beyond the cave. According to Plato, this allegory represents the human condition, where people are trapped in a world of illusions and falsehoods, unable to access the true reality that lies beyond.
Plato's view of truth has important implications for how he thinks about poetry and the arts. In the Republic, Plato is famously critical of the arts, arguing that they are not only useless but also actively harmful to the soul. Plato believes that the arts are a form of imitation that appeals to the emotions and senses rather than reason and intellect. This makes them unreliable and misleading, since they cannot give us access to the objective truth that is the realm of philosophy. In Book X of the Republic, Plato even suggests that the arts should be censored and banned from the ideal society he envisions.
These contrasting views of truth have important implications for how Shakespeare and Plato approach poetry and the arts. In A Midsummer Night's Dream, Shakespeare is much more sympathetic to the arts, viewing them as a vital part of human experience. The play is full of references to poetry and music, which characters use to express their emotions and to connect with each other. Shakespeare seems to believe that art has the power to convey truths that are more complex and nuanced than anything that can be expressed through reason alone. In fact, the very fact that the play is built around a set of fictional stories suggests that fiction and imagination can be a source of truth in their own right.
Plato, on the other hand, is deeply suspicious of the arts and believes they are a source of moral and intellectual corruption. In his view, the arts are a form of imitation that appeals to the emotions and the senses, rather than the intellect and reason. This makes them unreliable and misleading, since they cannot give us access to the objective truth that is the realm of philosophy. Plato's hostility towards the arts reflects his belief that the pursuit of truth requires us to move beyond our subjective experiences and to seek out knowledge that exists outside of ourselves.
In conclusion, A Midsummer Night's Dream and Plato's Republic present two different views of truth that have important implications for how the authors approach poetry and the arts. Shakespeare's play presents truth as a subjective and elusive concept that is contingent upon our emotions and experiences. This allows him to view the arts as a vital means of expressing complex truths that cannot be conveyed through reason alone. Plato, on the other hand, sees truth as an objective and external entity that can only be accessed through reason and philosophy. This leads him to view the arts as unreliable and misleading, since they are based on subjective experiences rather than objective knowledge. These contrasting views suggest that the way we understand truth has a profound impact on how we approach the world around us, including the ways in which we create and appreciate art.
