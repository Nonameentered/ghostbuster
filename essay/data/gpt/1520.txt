G.E.M. Anscombe was a British philosopher who argued that our understanding of morality must move beyond the language of obligation and duty. In her influential article, “Modern Moral Philosophy,” Anscombe challenges the traditional notion of moral obligation and instead proposed that we should focus on the details of moral action rather than abstract rules. This essay aims to analyze Anscombe’s thesis, her ideas on moral obligation, and the strengths and weaknesses of her argument. Ultimately, I will argue that moral obligation is a necessary component of any ethical theory as it provides a foundational structure that allows for the resolution of moral issues.
At the beginning of her article, Anscombe draws attention to the language of morality as it is often used today, focusing on terms such as “ought,” “duty,” and “obligation.” She argues that these words have lost their efficacy in contemporary discourse because they do not explain the reason behind moral rules. In many ways, Anscombe’s argument is one that challenges the ideas of consequentialism, deontological ethics, and virtue ethics, arguing that we need to look beyond these theories for a more comprehensive understanding of morality.
Anscombe believes that the language of moral obligation is problematic because it operates within a framework of moral command. This framework assumes that there is an objective standard of morality that is independent of individual feelings or cultural norms. Anscombe argues that this is not the case. Instead, she suggests that morality should be considered within the framework of moral agent, in other words, focusing on the specific actions of individuals rather than general rules. 
Anscombe believes that the traditional framework of ethics, which relies on the concept of moral obligation, is derived from religious commandments. She notes that the concept of “duty” relies on the notion that there is a God who commands certain actions. In the absence of this God, there is no reason to obey these commands. Therefore, moral obligation is not a reliable tool for grounding our actions.
Anscombe believes that our understanding of morality must move beyond the language of obligation and duty. Instead of focusing on abstract rules, we should be more precise and detailed in our language. We should concentrate on the specificity of the situation and the actions that need to be taken. According to Anscombe, this focus on the particulars is what distinguishes moral theories that are grounded in reality, and that is what is required for moral thinking.
One of the most significant strengths of Anscombe’s argument is her challenge to theories of moral obligation that assume an objective standard. She argues that morality cannot exist outside of individual agents and their actions, which highlights the importance of individual responsibility. The focus on the individual, not only as a moral agent but also as someone who can only act within a specific context, ensures that morality is not reduced to a theoretical framework. 
Another strength of Anscombe’s argument is that it emphasizes the need for moral thinking to be precise and context-specific, which can prevent biases or harmful generalizations. Instead of relying on abstract rules that can be applied universally, Anscombe urges us to consider the specific details of a situation. This approach lays the foundation for moral thinking that is more nuanced, flexible, and adaptable to complex issues.
Despite the strengths of Anscombe’s argument, her critiques of moral obligation have been challenged by many philosophers. One of the most significant criticisms of Anscombe is that her focus on the particulars ignores the fact that we often need to rely on abstract rules to make ethical decisions. Without rules, we lose a foundational basis on which to construct our ethical beliefs, which can lead to unethical or arbitrary outcomes.
Another weakness of Anscombe’s argument is that it can lead to moral relativism, where every act is seen as permissible or impermissible depending on the context in which it occurs. While morality must be context-specific, it cannot be subjective to the point where no objective standard can be established. This would lead to an ethical vacuum, making it difficult to establish any moral framework that could guide our actions.
Finally, Anscombe’s argument takes a very different perspective from normative ethics that many philosophers believe is necessary for guiding ethical behavior. Normative ethics aims to establish a standard of behavior, whether it be consequentialism, deontological ethics, or virtue ethics, that can help individuals make ethical decisions. By rejecting the framework of moral obligation and duty, Anscombe’s proposal seems to disregard any attempt to establish an ethical standard.
While Anscombe’s proposal challenges much of what we take for granted in our moral language, her thinking can be instrumental in prompting us to refine our ethical theories and recalibrate our approach to moral thinking. She encourages us to be more precise in our thinking, and to consider the specifics of each situation when making ethical decisions. However, her rejection of the notion of moral obligation and duty ultimately falls short as it does not recognize the importance of foundational rules in guiding ethical thought.
In conclusion, G.E.M. Anscombe’s influential article, “Modern Moral Philosophy,” argues that we should move beyond the language of obligation and duty to focus on context-specific details. While this approach has some strengths, it fails to recognize the importance of foundational rules in ethical thought. Moral obligation provides a structure within which ethical dilemmas can be resolved, and adherence to moral standards constitutes a necessary precondition for ethical conduct. Thus, moral obligation should not be abandoned, but instead refined and rethought in light of the arguments presented by Anscombe. Ultimately, it is essential to preserve a proper balance between the specificity of the context and the overarching moral principles that bind it together.
