The Citroen C4 advertisement, which portrays the car as a dancing robot, is a perfect example of how a multimodal approach to discourse and semiotics helps analyze advertisements and understand how meanings are created through interpretation. This approach is crucial since texts are complex and can be interpreted differently depending on the context, personal experiences, and values of the audience.
Firstly, a multimodal approach allows analyzing the advertisement beyond its verbal content. It is essential to consider how different modes such as images, music, and colors contribute to the creation of meaning. The ad begins with a yellow robotic hand transforming into a car, which is accompanied by electronic music. The use of technology and futuristic music creates an idea of innovation and advancement. Additionally, the robot appears to be dancing gracefully and fluidly, which has a positive impact on the viewers' perception of the car. Therefore, the advertisement's multimodal elements work together to communicate the message that Citroen C4 is a car that is advanced, innovative, and elegant.
Secondly, the advertisement uses semiotics to convey its message. Semiotics deals with signs and symbols and their interpretation. In this ad, the signifiers, such as the robot and its dance, are combined to convey the signified message of the car's features. The signs used in the ad are culturally specific; therefore, the interpretation of such signs can vary depending on the audience. The dance of the robot signifies fluidity and agility, which is associated with the car's performance. The robot mimics human movements and emotions, which suggests that the car and robot are similar in some ways. The Citroen C4, according to the ad, is not just a car, but a friend or a companion, which is achieved by the use of anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism, which is the attribution of human characteristics to animals or inanimate objects, is used to create a connection between the car and the audience.
Finally, analyzing the Citroen C4 advertising campaign reveals how meanings are created through interpretation. The advertisement is designed to create specific meanings through the use of visual and audio elements. However, the audience can interpret the message differently based on their experiences and values. For instance, the robot dance may be interpreted as an environmental degradation symbol by an environmentally conscious audience, as it signifies the carbon emissions prevalent in cars. Another interpretation could be that the robot dance communicates brand reliability in the sense that the dancing robot transforms into the Citroen C4, which fulfills the promise that the robot dances to convey: that the car is advanced, innovative, and elegant. 
In conclusion, the multimodal approach to discourse and semiotics helps analyze the Citroen C4 advertisement, which portrays the car as a dancing robot, and reveal how people understand texts through interpretation. Semiotics allows one to understand that signs in advertisements can have different meanings based on cultural, social, and personal factors. The multimodal approach helps analyze the nonverbal elements of the ad, which contribute to creating meaning. Interpretation, on the other hand, though it varies based on different factors, reveals the ad's underlying message that the Citroen C4 is an advanced, innovative, and elegant car, which is both reliable and environmentally conscious.
