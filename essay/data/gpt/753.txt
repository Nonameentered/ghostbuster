Conflict is a growing issue in today's world and takes various forms, including civil wars. Civil wars are armed conflicts that occur between different groups within a country. These wars cause significant damage to a country's economy and result in a loss of lives, displacement of people, and destruction of infrastructure. Conflict resolution is, therefore, a crucial aspect of creating peace and economic development in a country. The economic theory of conflict and peace resolution provides an insight into the causes and possible solutions to civil wars. This theory examines how economic variables such as income, growth, and structure affect the likelihood of conflict and how subjective grievances may not be the determining factor in whether a country experiences civil war.
Firstly, economic variables such as income, growth, and structure affect the likelihood of conflict. Poor economic conditions such as low per capita income, income inequality, and unemployment increase the likelihood of conflict. In low-income countries, people are more likely to protest against the government, which may lead to civil war. Similarly, income inequality is a significant contributor to conflict. Countries with a high concentration of wealth in a few individuals or groups are more likely to experience civil wars. This is because the lack of economic opportunities for the majority of the people creates a sense of injustice, which fuels conflict.
In addition to income and inequality, economic growth plays a role in the likelihood of civil wars. Countries with higher economic growth rates are less likely to experience conflict than those with low economic growth rates. Economic growth creates opportunities for employment, increases the quality of life, and reduces the sense of injustice among people, which reduces the likelihood of conflict. It is, therefore, essential for countries to focus on sustainable economic growth to prevent civil wars.
Another economic variable that affects the likelihood of conflict is economic structure. Countries with an export-oriented economy are more likely to experience civil wars than those with a diversified economy. This is because export-oriented economies are susceptible to external shocks such as changes in commodity prices, which leads to economic stagnation. Similarly, countries with a high dependence on primary commodities such as oil or diamonds are more likely to experience civil wars. The resource curse theory argues that countries with an abundance of natural resources are more likely to experience conflict, as the government and other groups compete for control over the resources.
Furthermore, subjective grievances may not be the determining factor in whether a country experiences civil war. The subjective feeling of the injustice of government policies or repression is often cited as a primary cause of civil wars. However, economic variables play a more significant role in the likelihood of civil wars. For example, in countries with high levels of poverty and inequality, the subjective grievances may not be the primary cause of civil wars. The sense of injustice that leads to conflict is a result of economic conditions rather than specific government policies.
The Collier-Hoeffler econometric model of civil war provides an insight into the relationship between primary commodity exports, ethnic domination, and conflict risk. The model suggests that countries with a high proportion of primary commodity exports are more likely to experience civil wars. The reason is that the dominance of one or a few primary commodity exports creates a vulnerability to external shocks, which leads to economic stagnation and conflict. Additionally, ethnic domination is another significant predictor of civil wars. Countries with a history of ethnic domination or exclusion are more likely to experience civil wars, as ethnic groups compete for political power and resources.
In conclusion, the economic theory of conflict and peace resolution provides an insight into the causes and possible solutions to civil wars. Economic variables such as income, growth, and structure affect the likelihood of conflict, and subjective grievances may not be the primary cause of civil wars. The Collier-Hoeffler econometric model of civil war suggests that primary commodity exports and ethnic domination are significant predictors of conflict. It is, therefore, essential for governments to focus on sustainable economic growth, income distribution, and ethnic inclusion policies to prevent civil wars and promote economic development.
