In Gustave Flaubert’s novel Madame Bovary, the protagonist Emma Bovary is depicted as a woman with an insatiable desire for romanticism and passion, leading her to make decisions that ultimately lead to her tragic end. Emma’s decision to live her life as if it were a fictional romance novel results in her unfortunate destiny. While some readers may sympathize with Emma due to the societal constraints of her time, it is ultimately her dangerous lifestyle and inability to accept reality that leads to her downfall.
Emma Bovary’s desire to live a fictional life is deeply rooted in the lack of excitement and desire that she faces in her mundane day-to-day life. She longs for adventure and passion, which she believes only exist in the romantic novels she often reads. Her lack of satisfaction with her life leads her to make irrational decisions such as her affair with Rodolphe, a wealthy landowner. Her fantasies and desires for cliché happiness cloud her judgment, causing her to put aside her moral code and act recklessly. In reality, Emma’s expectations of constant passion and excitement are unrealistic and should never be taken as an accurate representation of real life. Through the character of Emma Bovary, Flaubert highlights the danger of allowing our fantasies and desires to govern our actions and decisions.
Moreover, Emma’s discontent with her marriage to Charles Bovary is a key factor in her tragic fate. She fantasizes and romanticizes an ideal relationship, one that is completely different from her daily life with Charles. She sees her husband as a weak and inadequate partner unable to provide the passionate and romantic connection that she craves. Emma’s lack of satisfaction in her married life leads her to seek the affections of other men, leading ultimately to her ruin. The environment of her time, where women were unable to divorce and could only marry once, made it easy to understand Emma Bovary’s frustration. However, instead of addressing these feelings with her husband and, in turn, working to create a more satisfying relationship, Emma chooses to look for fantasies and fulfillments outside of her marriage.
In addition, Emma’s inability to accept reality further contributes to her downfall. She is unable to acknowledge the conformity of her position and her actions, leading her to make uninformed and reckless decisions. Emma’s vanity ultimately leads to her financial ruin as she spends beyond her means. She is unable to accept the cruelty of reality, and she fails to understand the consequences of her actions. Her indulgence in fiction and fantasy led her into a deep debt, which only added to the turmoil in her life. Emma’s inability to accept reality is a direct consequence of her isolation from society, she did not pursue friendships and relationships that could have strengthened her moral compass and her sense of reality.
Emma Bovary’s lack of accountability further leads to her tragedy. She constantly blames and is frustrated by outside factors that contribute to her situation, such as her husband’s inadequacies and her financial constraints. Emma’s lack of agency and responsibility over her choices leads to her demise. Instead of seeking guidance and help from her community, she isolates herself and attempts to find her own way, which only leads to her ruin.
 Flaubert’s portrayal of Emma Bovary is not to be understood as heroic or a role model. Emma’s actions are self-centered and dangerous, and her inability to accept reality and her accountability shrouds her judgment. Flaubert aims to warn the reader of the dangers of not staying grounded in reality and seeking false expectations, leading to ruin and heartbreak.
In conclusion, Emma Bovary’s decision to splurge on her passion for living as if in a romance novel ultimately ends in her tragic end. Her character highlights the dangers of putting fantasy and desire above reality, and even with the sobbing tragic end, it is hard for the reader to fully sympathize with her. Her escapades from reality and refusal to accept the consequences paved the course of her downfall. While we sympathize with her societal constraints, Emma’s inability to take responsibility for her actions and her dangerous decisions result in her tragic fate. Flaubert’s portrayal of Emma Bovary as flawed aims to teach and warn readers of the harsh consequences of not living in reality. Life may not always be awe-striking, but it is nonetheless real and must be faced with acceptance and bravery.
