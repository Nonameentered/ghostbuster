The debate surrounding the mind-body problem has been a central topic in philosophy since the ancient Greeks. At the core of this debate is the question of the nature of the relationship between the mind and the body. For centuries, the dominant view was that the body and mind were intertwined, and the soul, as an Aristotelian concept, was seen as a mediator between them. In contrast, the Cartesian philosophy of Ren√© Descartes proposed that there was a real distinction between mind and body, and each operated independently. In this essay, I will explore Descartes' argument for this distinction, its differences from traditional views of the soul and Christianity, its premise, and its origin within the Meditations. Finally, I will consider the potential problems that arise from this argument.
The idea of a distinction between mind and body can trace its roots back to Ancient Greece, where it was first proposed by Heraclitus. He introduced the idea that there was a tension between the world of physical things and the world of mental entities, causing these two realms to operate independently. This idea was later expanded upon by Plato, who added a new dimension to the discussion, proposing that the soul could exist independently of the body. For Plato, it was the soul that gave the body life, and he placed the soul in a higher order of existence than the body. This view gained a new perspective with the advent of Christianity, which adopted the Platonic view of the soul. Christianity endowed the soul with religious significance, and it saw the natural world as temporary while the soul carried on after death.
In contrast, Descartes argues for a separation between mind and body while denying the existence of the soul. He proposed that the essence of the human being was the mind or the self-aware entity, which is created through reason and visible to introspection. Descartes saw the mind as entirely distinct from the physical world, where it was subject to doubt due to sensory errors. According to him, the mind is indivisible, eternal, and non-extended. In contrast, the body is divisible, situated in the physical world, and subject to the laws of physics. The mind-body relationship, for Descartes, is akin to that between a sailor and their ship, as described in his Meditations.
To understand Descartes' arguments for the real distinction between mind and body, it is essential first to examine his methodological doubt. Descartes used this method to shed light on the foundations of knowledge by questioning every idea that could be doubted. He asserts that he saw error in the opinions based on sense, where he found nothing that could not be doubted. Descartes believed that one could only have certain knowledge if they started from basic self-evident truths and deduced propositions from there. In his Meditations, he affirmed his existence as an absolute certainty, stating that, "I am, I exist, is necessarily true every time I conceive of it in my mind." Here, Descartes identified the ego, or the self, as a thing distinct from the body and a foundation for a philosophical system.
Descartes then asserted that the concept of the mind relied on his understanding of the self, just like an identical idea to the self. The self, he suggested, was distinct from the body and the mind, which are both subject to doubt. He believed that the mind is a separate entity from the body, and the two operate independently from one another. Descartes needed to establish this separation since it is key to his explanation of how humans can have knowledge beyond just sensory information.
One argument often employed by Descartes was the argument from doubt, where he suggested that the mind and body have separate natures. Descartes reflects that he had a definite experience of himself as thinking, that, in all of his thoughts, he was simply a thing that is thinking. He argues that this experience of mind is incompatible with bodily life, including extension and divisibility, which can be doubted. According to him, the only way to know anything about the body was through the mind.
Another supporting argument was the argument from imagination. Descartes employed the argument from imagination by proposing that the mind could conceive any ideas that it can create just by contemplating them. The body could not do this because it was constantly moving, and its limitations were set by the laws of physics. The mind operates through ideas, and it is the generator of all concepts. Descartes envisioned that the mind could create an idea of itself even without the body's assistance, which, to his mind, proved that it existed independently.
Another argument for the mind-body distinction was his discussion about the body's physical pain, where he argued that there was a clear difference in how the mind perceives it. According to Descartes, all mental states could be measured, whereas bodily pains could not. Therefore, there must be some other force that causes bodily pain, and the spiritual state of the self is the most likely candidate.
One other argument Descartes used was the argument of the wax. He used this analogy to explain that our knowledge of physical things is not purely sensory but relies on intuition. He created an imaginary scenario where he melted a piece of wax. The senses would tell us that the wax would change shape, color, texture, and temperature. However, our knowledge that the object is wax is beyond our sensory perception, which shows that there is a clear distinction between the mind, which grasps the essence of an object, and the body, which is subject to sensory-based reasoning.
The key premise underpinning Descartes' argument for mind-body dualism is that the mind and body are entirely separate entities governed by different sets of rules. The mind is made up of ideas that are clear and distinct, whereas the body is material and operates on the principles of physics. Additionally, the mind is the source of all knowledge, whereas the body is the machine that carries the mind around. Finally, the mind is immortal, whereas the body is constantly changing and thus has an expiration date. Descartes arrived at this conclusion through his methodological doubt, his understanding of consciousness, his theory of knowledge, and his arguments about the soul's existence.
However, there are potential problems or unanswered questions that arise from this conception of the mind-body distinction. These include how the mind and body come into contact with one another, how the mind can move the body, and how mental events correspond to physical events. This leads to the perplexing issue of the interaction between the two entities, as Cartesian dualism does not present a logical explanation for how such an interaction would occur. Furthermore, Descartes denied the existence of the soul, thus leaving a materialist theory of self that leaves unanswered questions regarding the nature of the self.
In conclusion, the Cartesian philosophy of the mind-body distinction challenged the Aristotelian concept of the soul and Christianity's interpretation of the self. Descartes argued that the mind and body were separate entities operating autonomously, with the mind creating knowledge beyond sensory experience. Descartes arrived at this conclusion through his method of doubt, his understanding of consciousness, his theory of knowledge, and his arguments about the soul's existence. Nonetheless, problems remain in this conception of the mind-body distinction, including the unresolved question of interaction between the entities and the absence of a logical explanation for how such interaction would occur.
