Joseph L. Mankiewicz's film, Dragonwyck, released in 1946, follows the story of a young woman, Miranda Wells (Gene Tierney), who is thrilled when she is invited to stay with Nicholas Van Ryn (Vincent Price), a wealthy aristocrat, and his family at their mansion in Upstate New York. The ball scene in the film is a key moment in the narrative and has several Classical Hollywood Cinema characteristics. Mise-en-scène, or the arrangement of everything that appears in the framing, is effectively employed to enhance the scene. This essay will explain how the ball scene conforms to the characteristics of Classical Hollywood Cinema and how mise-en-scène is used to create a visual feast.
Classical Hollywood Cinema is a term that refers to the style of filmmaking that dominated American cinema from the 1920s to the 1960s. It is characterized by a set of conventions and stylistic devices that are designed to make the film experience as engaging and immersive as possible for the audience. Some of the key characteristics of Classical Hollywood Cinema include a clear narrative structure, a focus on character development, the use of continuity editing, a reliance on stars, and an emphasis on creating a sense of realism.
The ball scene in Dragonwyck conforms to several of these characteristics. Firstly, the clear narrative structure is evident in the scene. The ball is a significant moment in the narrative because it marks the turning point for the relationship between Miranda and Nicholas. As the scene unfolds, it becomes clear that Nicholas is attracted to Miranda, and this is a crucial moment in the development of their relationship. Secondly, the focus on character development is evident in the ball scene. As Miranda becomes more comfortable in her surroundings, her confidence grows, and she begins to interact more confidently with the other guests. This character development is crucial for the audience to understand her growth as a character throughout the film.
Thirdly, the use of continuity editing is employed to good effect in the ball scene. The editing is seamless, and the cuts between shots are fluid, creating a sense of coherence and continuity in the scene. Fourthly, the scene relies on the presence of stars to engage the audience. Gene Tierney and Vincent Price are both well-known actors, and their presence in the scene adds to the allure and glamour of the sequence.
Lastly, Classical Hollywood Cinema is known for creating a sense of realism through its use of mise-en-scène. The ball scene in Dragonwyck is no exception. The exquisite attention to detail in the composition of the scene, including the location, set design, costumes, and lighting, creates a sense of realism that transports the audience to the early 19th century.
Mise-en-scène, or the arrangement of everything that appears in the framing, is used to great effect in the ball scene. The lighting, in particular, is worth discussing. The scene takes place at night, and the use of low-key lighting creates a sense of mystery and intrigue. The lighting also highlights the beauty of the costumes and decor. The chandeliers and candelabras in the ballroom are illuminated, casting a warm, flickering glow on the scene. This creates depth and dimensionality in the shot, which adds to the visual appeal of the sequence.
The set design is another aspect of mise-en-scène that enhances the scene. The ballroom has been meticulously designed to create an authentic 19th-century setting. The ornate, high-ceilinged ballroom is decorated with period furnishings, including chandeliers, candelabras, and draperies. The costumes and hairstyles of the guests are also carefully chosen to convey the social and economic status of the characters.
The camera angles and composition of the shots also contribute to the mise-en-scène. The shots are usually mid to long, creating a sense of space and grandeur in the scene. The camera is also often stationary, which allows the audience to fully appreciate the set design and the movements of the characters in the scene. The camera movement is used sparingly, but when it is, it adds a dynamic quality to the shot, such as when Miranda dances with Nicholas.
The use of music in the scene is another aspect of mise-en-scène that enhances the experience. The ballroom is filled with music from an orchestra, which adds to the festive atmosphere of the scene. The music is carefully chosen to match the period setting and the mood of the scene. At key moments in the dance, the music swells, signaling a change in the tone of the scene. This use of music effectively manipulates the emotions of the audience, adding to the dramatic impact of the scene.
In conclusion, the ball scene in Dragonwyck conforms to the characteristics of Classical Hollywood Cinema, and the mise-en-scène is employed effectively to enhance the scene. The attention to detail in the set design, costumes, lighting, and music all contribute to creating a sense of realism and authenticity in the film. The camera angles, composition, and camera movement are also used effectively to create a visually engaging sequence. The ball scene is a key moment in the narrative of the film and is one of the highlights of the Classical Hollywood Cinema era, showcasing the technical prowess and the creative vision of Mankiewicz and his team.
