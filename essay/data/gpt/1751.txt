Geisha, a traditional Japanese female entertainer, has long been a topic of fascination and curiosity for people all over the world. Though widely recognized, most of our knowledge about geisha has been derived from movies, television shows, or other forms of media, which tend to present a misleading and often inaccurate picture of the profession. Thus, Liza Dalby's ethnography, "Geisha," has been a landmark book that has changed people's perceptions of the geisha profession and rectified many cultural misinterpretations around it. In this essay, I will examine some of the most significant cultural misinterpretations around geisha and explain how Dalby's ethnography has rectified them. I will also discuss how the post-war era has impacted the geisha profession.
One of the most common misinterpretations around geisha is the notion that they are prostitutes. The word "geisha" itself translates to "art person," and geisha are not prostitutes but highly accomplished artists who entertain their clients through music, dance, conversation, and games. They undergo rigorous training to master various skills, including traditional Japanese music, dance, tea ceremony, flower arranging, and calligraphy. Dalby's ethnography offers a comprehensive and detailed account of the training, skills, and routines of geisha, thereby rectifying this common misconception.
Another misinterpretation about geisha is that they are women who are sold into slavery by their families. This is a myth that dates back to the Edo period when young girls from low-caste families were sold into slavery and forced into becoming mizuage, which means selling their virginity to the highest bidder. Mizuage was banned in 1959, and it was a practice that has not been a part of the geisha profession for decades. In her ethnography, Dalby examines the history of mizuage and its impact on the geisha profession, effectively dispelling this common myth. She explains that becoming a geisha is a chosen profession and that the women who enter the profession do so willingly.
Another cultural misinterpretation is that geishas' work is purely recreational and that their clients are only men. Dalby argues that this misinterpretation has arisen because of the focus of media on the geisha's entertainment aspect. She contends that the geisha profession has been more varied in the past than that and that it has been dependent on various clientele. Traditionally, geisha entertained at tea houses and teahouses exclusively for male customers. However, the post-war era saw geishas permitted to work in hotels, dance in public, and dress as ordinary women when not working, which broadened the clientele base and opened the possibility of female clients. Thus, Dalby's exploration of the geisha profession provides insight into the organization's varied past.
Finally, an important cultural misinterpretation about geishas is that they are women who are subservient to male clients and function as arm candy. Geishas perform an array of artistic and creative tasks and have a unique role in Japanese society. They are well-respected professionals who have served as confidantes, scholars, and entertainers to Japanese clientele for centuries. As Dalby notes, geisha have been prominent people within Japanese society and have existed in the grey area of prostitution definitions, making them significant participants in Japanese socio-cultural transformations. Therefore, it is essential to reframe not only our understandings of geisha and the work they do but also to consider the profession's historical legacy and the cultural significance of ones who are at the frontier of representing Japan's unique culture.
The impact of the post-war era on the geisha profession has been significant. The Allied Occupation saw the decline of traditional Japanese culture, and the geisha profession was not left out. The United States' presence meant that the profession of geisha, which was once a well-respected profession and an art form, was associated with prostitution. In addition, GIs were eager to see the geisha women dance and were willing to pay them a hefty amount for an evening's entertainment. This impact was a turning point in the profession of geisha, where they were allowed to function in hotels in front of multiple audiences and became more like hostesses than traditional geisha. This transition shows how the geisha profession had evolved with time, taking on aspects of modernization, with more focus on entertainment, and the intellectual side of their work fading away.
In conclusion, geisha has long been a subject of fascination and curiosity for outsiders. However, the information we have about geishas has often been inaccurate and steeped in stereotype. "Geisha," Liza Dalby's ethnography, offers a comprehensive study of the geisha profession, debunking many of the myths and misinterpretations that surround the profession. The book provides an insight into the rich cultural heritage of Japan and provides a window into an exceptional profession that has been evolving over centuries. The post-war era has significantly changed the profession, and although some aspects have survived, it remains a valuable and fascinating work of art to be celebrated and respected.
