Introduction
Health and wellbeing are critical aspects of any individual's life. However, the definition of health and wellbeing varies depending on one's perspective, cultural beliefs, and societal setting. The World Health Organisation (WHO) defines health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. Health and social care practitioners, including doctors, nurses, social workers, and other healthcare professionals, work with patients from different cultural backgrounds, beliefs, and social standings. As a result, they encounter various perspectives of health and wellbeing that significantly affect communication and care quality. This essay analyzes the complexities of different perspectives of health and wellbeing, their impact on communication in health and social care, evaluates WHO's definition of health, identifies barriers to good practitioner/patient relationships and multidisciplinary teamwork, and suggests strategies for improvement.
Perspectives of Health and Wellbeing
Health and wellbeing can be viewed from multiple perspectives, including biomedical, social, cultural, and spiritual perspectives. The biomedical view of health states that health is the absence of disease or injury, and the cure is medical intervention. It emphasizes the importance of medical diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. However, the social perspective of health recognizes that health is not only related to individual biology but also to social, economic, and environmental factors. Social determinants of health, including poverty, education, employment, and housing, influence an individual's health status.
The cultural perspective of health recognizes that health and wellbeing vary across different cultures and belief systems. It emphasizes the importance of spirituality and cultural practices in medicine. For instance, in African cultural settings, disease is often believed to be caused by supernatural powers and can only be treated through traditional methods such as rituals, sacrifices, herbs, and healers. Therefore, understanding cultural beliefs is critical in bridging the gap between healthcare providers and patients.
The spiritual perspective of health recognizes the placebo effect of spiritual interventions such as mindfulness, meditation, prayer, and religious beliefs in healthcare. Scientists note the positive correlation between spirituality and well-being, and its incorporation in formal healthcare practices is gaining momentum.
Impact of Perspectives on Communication in Health and Social Care
The different perspectives of health and wellbeing affect communication in health and social care practice. Communication is a critical aspect of healthcare as it ensures that patients' health concerns are heard and addressed, and the treatment administered is effective. Effective communication ensures that patients are involved in decision-making regarding diagnosis, treatment, and recovery.
However, communication in health and social care is problematic due to the varying perspectives of health and wellbeing. For instance, when communicating with patients from different cultures, language barriers, cultural barriers, and misunderstandings arise, leading to ineffective communication. In addition, some patients may prefer traditional healthcare practices, causing a conflict between cultural beliefs and modern medicine. Communication with patients who view health and wellbeing from a spiritual perspective may also be compromised as some healthcare providers may not be comfortable with spirituality's integration into healthcare practice. Effective communication is required to bridge the cultural and spiritual divide, ensuring effective treatment.
Evaluation of WHO's Definition of Health
WHO's definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity has been a subject of criticism. Critics argue that the definition is vague, utopian, and unrealistic. First, the definition fails to recognize the limitations of human beings in achieving total wellbeing, especially since there are genetic and environmental factors that are out of human control.
Secondly, the definition is criticized for being Western-centric, insensitive to the cultural diversity that exists in the world, and fails to consider cultural beliefs and values that influence one's perspective of health and well-being. Finally, the definition focuses on the physical body's state of wellbeing at the expense of the psychological, emotional, and spiritual aspects.
Despite the criticisms, the WHO's definition highlights the importance of addressing social and economic factors that affect an individual's wellbeing. It provides a framework for healthcare providers to look beyond the physical condition of an individual and explore the social, economic, and environmental factors that influence the individual's health status. However, limitations of the definition require healthcare providers to look beyond WHO's definition and incorporate cultural and spiritual perspectives in healthcare.
Barriers to Good Practitioner/Patient Relationships and Multidisciplinary Teamwork
Effective communication in health and social care requires good practitioner/patient relationships and multidisciplinary teamwork. However, several barriers affect such relationships, including cultural differences, language barriers, and lack of trust between healthcare providers and patients.
Cultural barriers arise where healthcare providers are unfamiliar with the cultural practices and beliefs of their patients leading to cultural insensitivity. Language barriers also hamper effective communication, especially with patients who cannot speak the language of the healthcare team, increasing the chances of misdiagnosis or wrong treatment. Lack of trust between the healthcare provider and patient arises from past experiences, where patients feel that the healthcare provider does not give them personalized attention or does not involve them in decision-making.
In addition to the barriers between healthcare providers and patients, multidisciplinary team communication can also be challenging. Healthcare providers from different disciplines may have different terminologies, jargon, and paradigms leading to misunderstandings and delayed treatment.
Strategies for Improvement
To address barriers to effective communication in health and social care, healthcare providers should adopt culturally responsive communication techniques. Healthcare providers need to understand the cultural practices and beliefs of their patients. Language barriers can be addressed through the provision of interpretation services or through hiring healthcare providers with diverse cultural backgrounds. Patient-centered care, an approach whereby healthcare providers involve patients in decision-making, can build trust between healthcare providers and patients.
Multidisciplinary team communication can be improved through regular inter-professional communication and consultations. Standardizing the use of medical terminologies within and across disciplines is also important in ensuring effective communication. Documenting medical terminologies using a medical dictionary also ensures that healthcare providers can access the same information regardless of their discipline.
Conclusion
In conclusion, understanding diverse perspectives of health and wellbeing in healthcare is critical in ensuring that healthcare providers are culturally responsive. Effective communication between healthcare providers and patients is also critical to ensure effective diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. WHO's definition of health provides a useful framework for healthcare providers, but it requires supplementing with cultural and spiritual perspectives. Healthcare providers must adopt communication skills that promote trusting relationships with patients and multidisciplinary teamwork. Investing in measures that enhance communication and cultural sensitivity will help healthcare providers effectively care for patients from different perspectives of health and wellbeing.
