Introduction
Social identity is a construct that plays a significant role in literature, and through the narrative and characters, readers can understand its dynamics. The politics of space and place are critical in shaping social identity, and this has been demonstrated in Charles Dickens' Great Expectations and Alan Warner's Morvern Callar. In these two novels, the characters face various challenges that impact how they see themselves and how they are perceived by the society around them. In this essay, we will examine how the politics of space and place shape social identity in these two literary works and how they address the contemporary dilemma of self-identity in literature.
The Politics of Space and Place in Great Expectations
Charles Dickens' Great Expectations is a novel that explores social identity in the Victorian era. The novel follows the life of the protagonist, Pip, who grows up in a poor family in a village in England. He is later adopted by a wealthy woman, Miss Havisham, who lives in a grand mansion, and this changes his life significantly. The politics of space and place are evident in this novel, and they play a central role in shaping Pip's social identity.
For instance, when Pip is adopted by Miss Havisham, he moves from a poor working-class family to the upper class. This change in social status impacts his identity, and he develops a sense of entitlement and arrogance. He starts to view himself as superior to those in his previous social class, and this is evident when he treats his old friend, Joe, with contempt when he visits him. Pip's social identity is thus constructed through the politics of space and place in this novel.
Furthermore, the different settings in Great Expectations also play a significant role in shaping social identity. The novel is set in various locations such as the village where Pip grows up, London, and Miss Havisham's mansion. Each of these settings has a different social class, and Pip's interactions with people in each setting impact his social identity. For instance, when Pip moves to London, he is exposed to a city that is more diverse than his village, and this changes his perceptions of social class as he starts to realize that not all wealthy people are benevolent.
The Politics of Space and Place in Morvern Callar
Alan Warner's Morvern Callar is a novel that explores the life of a young Scottish woman, Morvern, who is struggling to come to terms with her identity. Like in Great Expectations, the politics of space and place play a significant role in shaping social identity.
The novel is set in various locations, and these locations impact Morvern's social identity. For instance, when Morvern goes on a trip to Spain with her friend, Lanna, she is exposed to a different culture, and this changes her perceptions of identity. She starts to question the societal norms that have been imposed on her and starts to imagine herself in different roles. The politics of space and place are thus critical in shaping Morvern's social identity as she navigates through different settings and encounters different people.
Furthermore, the settings in Morvern Callar also impact Morvern's sense of self. For instance, when Morvern discovers her boyfriend's dead body, she feels a sense of loss and confusion that forces her to re-evaluate her identity. This event leads Morvern to take control of her life and become more independent. The politics of space and place are thus crucial in shaping Morvern's social identity as she tries to separate herself from her past and forge a new identity.
Contemporary Dilemma of Self-Identity in Literature
The contemporary dilemma of self-identity in literature is evident in both Great Expectations and Morvern Callar. In both novels, the characters struggle to find their place in society and make sense of their identity. This is a prevalent theme in contemporary literature, and it is often a result of the changing social, economic, and cultural landscape.
For instance, the rise of globalization and the resulting multiculturalism have led to a rethinking of identity and belonging. In Morvern Callar, Morvern struggles to reconcile her Scottish identity with the new experiences and cultures she encounters. The same is evident in Great Expectations, where Pip's exposure to the upper-class society challenges his working-class identity.
Similarly, the increasing complexity of modern society has led to a questioning of traditional gender roles and stereotypes. In Morvern Callar, Morvern defies traditional gender roles as she takes control of her life and becomes more independent. In Great Expectations, the gender roles are also challenged as Miss Havisham takes on a male role and controls Pip's life.
Conclusion
In conclusion, social identity is a construct that plays a significant role in literature, and the politics of space and place are critical in shaping it. The novels Great Expectations and Morvern Callar demonstrate how different settings impact social identity and how characters navigate through these spaces to shape their sense of self. Furthermore, both novels address the contemporary dilemma of self-identity in literature, which is often a result of the changing social, economic, and cultural landscape.
