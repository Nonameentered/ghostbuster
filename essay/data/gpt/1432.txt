The aim of the experiment conducted on the reaction between Bromate and Bromide ions is to determine the activation energy barrier for the reaction and investigate the effect of temperature on the rate of the reaction. This experiment is important because it provides an understanding of the fundamental principles of chemical reactions and can help to explain the behavior of complex systems.
To determine the activation energy barrier for the reaction, the rate of the reaction at various temperatures is measured. This is done using a spectrophotometer to measure the absorbance of the solution over time. The rate constant, k, is then determined using the equation ln(A/A0) = -kt, where A is the absorbance at time t, A0 is the initial absorbance, and k is the rate constant.
Using the Arrhenius equation, k = Ae^(-Ea/RT), where A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin, the activation energy can be determined. By measuring the rate constant at multiple temperatures and plotting ln(k) vs 1/T, the activation energy barrier can be determined from the slope of the line.
However, there are sources of error and uncertainty in the experiment that can affect the accuracy and precision of the results. One source of error is the accuracy of the temperature measurement. If the temperature of the solution is not precisely controlled, the rate of the reaction may be affected, leading to inaccurate results. Additionally, the time at which the absorbance is measured must be consistent between trials to ensure accurate results.
Another source of uncertainty is the quality of the chemicals used. Impurities in the chemicals can affect the rate of the reaction, leading to inaccurate results. Additionally, the spectrophotometer must be calibrated properly to ensure accurate readings of absorbance, as any errors in the instrument can affect the results of the experiment.
To improve the accuracy and precision of the results, several steps can be taken. The temperature of the solution should be precisely controlled using a temperature-controlled bath or thermostat. Additionally, the timing of the absorbance measurements should be consistent between trials to reduce variability. Calibrating the spectrophotometer and using high-quality chemicals can also improve the accuracy of the results.
In conclusion, the aim of the experiment conducted on the reaction between Bromate and Bromide ions is to determine the activation energy barrier for the reaction and investigate the effect of temperature on the rate of the reaction. The activation energy barrier can be determined using the Arrhenius equation and measuring the rate constant at multiple temperatures. Sources of error and uncertainty in the experiment include the accuracy of temperature measurement, the quality of the chemicals used, and calibration of the spectrophotometer. To improve the accuracy and precision of the results, precise temperature control, consistent timing of absorbance measurements, and use of high-quality chemicals and calibrated instruments can be employed. Understanding the fundamental principles of chemical reactions is important for explaining the behavior of complex systems and can have broad applications in fields such as medicine and materials science.
