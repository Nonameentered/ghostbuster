The landscape of North America has been through a long history of transformation and change, from the arrival of the European colonizers to the present day. The attitudes towards this transformation have been varied and complex. On the one hand, the pastoral attitudes encouraged a romantic and sentimental view of the landscape that emphasized its natural beauty and rural charm. On the other hand, the progressive attitudes aimed for a rational and scientific approach to the landscape, emphasizing its utilitarian value and potential for economic development. These two attitudes often seemed incompatible and led to significant debate and conflict among writers and artists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Nevertheless, a third, middle way was possible, blending the pastoral and progressive attitudes to create a more nuanced and balanced perspective on the landscape of North America.
The pastoral attitude towards the landscape emerged as a reaction to industrialization and urbanization in Europe and America. It celebrated the simplicity and purity of rural life and the natural beauty of the landscape. This attitude found expression in literature, art, and architecture, with notable works including British Romantic poetry, American transcendentalist essays, and Georgian architecture. The idealization of rural life and the celebration of nature was particularly strong in the United States, where the frontier promoted a sense of adventure and possibility in the wilderness. American writers such as Washington Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, and Henry David Thoreau celebrated the beauty and majesty of nature, while artists such as Thomas Cole and Frederic Edwin Church used oil paintings to capture the sublime landscapes of the frontier.
However, while the pastoral attitude aimed to preserve the natural landscape, it often ignored the reality of social and economic change in North America. The United States was rapidly industrializing and urbanizing, and the pastoral ideal failed to provide a practical solution to the pressing challenges of this transformation. It was this realization that led to the emergence of the progressive attitude towards the landscape.
The progressive attitude towards the landscape saw it as a resource to be exploited for economic development and progress. This attitude found expression in the scientific and technological advancements of the nineteenth century, including new farming methods, land surveys, and railroad construction. The progressive attitude believed that the natural landscape was not a static or fixed entity, but something that could be optimized for human benefit. Prominent progressive writers and intellectuals, such as Henry George and John Wesley Powell, saw the landscape as a resource to be used for the public good, rather than for the enrichment of private interests. Progressive artists, such as Albert Bierstadt and William Henry Jackson, used oil paintings and photography, respectively, to capture the landscape in a realistic and objective manner.
Despite these different attitudes towards the landscape, a third, middle way was possible. This approach saw the landscape as a complex and dynamic entity, with both natural and human elements. It recognized the value of preserving certain natural areas for their aesthetic, cultural, and environmental significance, while also acknowledging the need for economic progress and development. This approach was exemplified by the landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted, who argued that the landscape had both utilitarian and aesthetic value. Olmsted designed public parks such as Central Park in New York City, which combined the necessities of practical urban planning with the romantic ideals of the pastoral landscape.
Other writers and artists also embraced this nuanced perspective on the landscape. American writer, Mark Twain, criticized the sentimental portrayal of rural life while also recognizing the need for practical economic progress. English writer, Charles Dickens, was critical of the industrialization taking place in England, but also saw the positive aspects of this transformation in creating jobs and wealth. Similarly, artists such as Winslow Homer and Thomas Eakins captured the complex social and economic changes taking place in America, while still maintaining a sense of natural beauty and romance in their works.
In conclusion, the pastoral and progressive attitudes towards the landscape in North America were often seen as incompatible, yet a middle way was possible. This middle way saw the landscape as a complex entity that required both preservation and development. American and English writers and artists in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries expressed this nuanced perspective, recognizing the need for practical progress and economic development without sacrificing the natural beauty and cultural significance of the landscape. Ultimately, this approach represents a more balanced and sustainable attitude to the landscape, one that can continue to guide us in our relationship with the land in the present day.
