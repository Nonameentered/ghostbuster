Marxism, as a political and economic ideology, has been one of the most influential theories in shaping the modern world. Even though the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, and China's approach to Marxism is more pragmatic, the ideas that Marx put forward are still pertinent to the current social and economic landscape. In this essay, we will explore what aspects of Marxism are still relevant in modern politics and economics, and how they inform our understanding of society and social progress.
Marxism's relevance in modern politics and economics is best understood by examining its core philosophy. The central idea of Marxism is the existence of a capitalist class that exploits the labor of the working class. Marx argued that the bourgeoisie, the capitalist class, controlled society and maintained their power through the ownership of the means of production. The proletariat, the working class, were oppressed by the bourgeoisie, being forced into drudging labor for little pay, with no agency in their work or their lives. Marxism espouses the belief that the exploitation of the working class by the bourgeoisie is morally wrong and that economic systems should be changed to achieve a fairer society.
One of the key aspects of Marxism in modern politics and economics is its emphasis on class struggle. Marx believed that class struggles were a driving force in human history, with different classes competing for resources, power, and influence. He believed that the working class, who had nothing to lose but their chains, should be the ones to take control of society from the bourgeoisie and create a fairer, more equitable society. This idea of class struggle is still relevant today, as income inequality continues to grow, and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few has become more pronounced. Class struggle is behind many of the political and economic tensions we see today, such as income disparity, gentrification, and political polarization.
Another aspect of Marxism that is still relevant is its critique of capitalism. Marx argued that the capitalist mode of production exploited workers by extracting value from their labor. The capitalist could then accumulate wealth by paying the workers less than their labor is worth. This idea is still visible in modern political and economic systems, in the form of low wages, job insecurity, and widening income inequality. Marx argued that capitalism was inherently flawed because it generated inequality and instability, causing crises of overproduction, economic recessions or depressions that disproportionately harm the poor.
Marxism's critique of capitalism has influenced several social and economic movements in modern times, including socialist movements, labor unions, and social justice movements. In response to rampant income inequality and lack of social mobility, the idea of socialism has become more popular in recent years to provide a more equitable approach to resource allocation by the state rather than the free market. Marxism is also associated with labor movements, such as the Fight for 15 campaign that calls for a minimum wage of $15 for all workers and the international movement of political parties such as Democratic Socialists of America. Marx's analysis of society has proven valuable in understanding how capitalism functions, and how its effects can be mitigated via state intervention in expanding social welfare programs or progressive taxation.
Marxism's influence in modern politics and economics also extends to its approach to history. Marx argued that history was the story of class struggle, as dominant classes sought to maintain their power and exploit the less powerful classes. This idea has been taken up by historians, anthropologists, and sociologists. They have used Marxist approaches to history to demonstrate the power dynamics at play in the making of society and culture, exploring the unequal distribution of power within political, economic, and social spheres. Marxist historians have critiqued the dominant narrative of history, often portraying it as biased and incomplete as it glorifies the ruling classes. Instead, Marxist approaches to history emphasize the contributions of the working classes, people of color, and women who have been marginalized in the dominant versions of history.
Another essential feature of Marxist ideology is the focus on equal distribution of resources and a belief in social progress. Marx believed that communism was the ideal social arrangement, in which all people would have equal access to resources and be able to live without fear of oppression. Although this ideal has never been achieved, it remains a powerful force in contemporary social movements. The idea of equity is central to the Black Lives Matter movement, which seeks to end systemic racism that denies social opportunities to African Americans due to inequality in education, employment, and wealth redistribution. Similarly, the Movement for Black Lives has made demands that serve to reduce income inequality and progressive taxation as one method to address the wealth gap between black and white Americans.
Marxist philosophy has also informed the feminist movement with an emphasis on equal opportunity and the end of gender discrimination. Marxism has argued that the oppression of women is rooted within capitalist society and its structure of work and politics. Women are paid less and face institutional barriers that prevent a path to economic status and political representation while being unfairly burdened with many reproductive and domestic activities. This structural oppression of women has historically been used by the ruling class to exploit women's cheap labor, and Marxists believe that feminism must be part of the larger fight against capitalism in the struggle for a more equitable society.
In conclusion, Marx's philosophy remains relevant in modern politics and economics, informing our understanding of society, social progress, and inequality. Marxism's criticism of capitalism and its emphasis on class struggle are still visible today in contemporary social and economic movements. While the ideal of communism has been criticized, Marxist approaches to history have been utilized to show the systemic inequality and bias in the dominant narratives of history. The Marxist belief in equal distribution of resources has inspired social and political movements fighting against systemic oppression, such as the Black Lives Matter and feminist movements. Thus, the Marxist approach of understanding economic, social, and political exclusion due to lack of power has been foundational in calling for more equal participation in all aspects of society.
