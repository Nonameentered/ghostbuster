Introduction
Research is critical in various fields, including nursing, as it helps in identifying and addressing various concerns and issues in the practice. Researchers adopt various methodologies that inform how they gather, analyze, and interpret data. Single-strategy and multi-strategy research are two common methodologies employed in nursing studies. Single-strategy research involves applying one methodology, while multi-strategy research involves combining several methodologies to answer a research question. Virtues of single-strategy research include its simplicity and ease of use, while its drawbacks include its inability to address complex research questions fully. Multi-strategy research, on the other hand, offers more comprehensive insights, but its complexity and time-consuming nature are some of its drawbacks. This essay critically discusses the virtues and drawbacks of single- and multi-strategy research in nursing by comparing two studies: 'The delivery of quality nursing care: a grounded theory study of the nurse's perspective' by Anne M. Williams and 'Integrating quantitative and qualitative methodologies for the assessment of health care systems: emergency medicine in post-conflict Serbia' by Brett D. Nelson and colleagues.
Single-Strategy Research
Single-strategy research involves using one particular methodology to answer a research question. It is known for its simplicity and ease of application. Single-strategy research enhances the collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data for nursing research. Single-strategy research can incorporate various methods, such as surveys, questionnaires, or interviews, and is useful in explaining phenomena that are readily measurable or visible.
One example of single-strategy research in nursing is 'The delivery of quality nursing care: a grounded theory study of the nurses' perspective' by Anne M. Williams. This study sought to explore the experiences and perceptions of nurses about quality nursing care. The study utilized a grounded theory approach by using one method, which is data collection through in-depth interviews with nurses working in medical-surgical and critical care units in two hospitals. The study's virtues include its purposive sampling method that selects participants based on specific criteria to ensure the study's relevance and meaningful results. Additionally, utilizing a single-strategy method made data collection and analysis easier and more straightforward, allowing for more robust, more precise, and focused results. However, one of the study's drawbacks was the lack of comprehensive data when analyzed using a single methodology, constraining the breadth and depth of data collected.
Multi-Strategy Research
Multi-strategy research involves the use of two or more methodologies to study a research topic. Multi-strategy research is often employed in cases where a single methodology cannot collect all the required information or if the application of one methodology leads to data loss or gaps. The study aims to balance the perspectives of using different methodologies to appreciate and analyze the research subject matter from multiple views. Using more than one approach increases the reliability, validity, and trustworthiness of the data. Multi-strategy research may be used to define and elaborate complex problems, particularly in nursing research, by adopting a mixed-methods approach to analyze quantitative and qualitative data.
One example of multi-strategy research in nursing is 'Integrating quantitative and qualitative methodologies for the assessment of health care systems: emergency medicine in post-conflict Serbia' by Brett D. Nelson and colleagues. The study utilized questionnaires, patient exit interviews, patient charts, and key informant interviews. The input from various sources occurs in several stages to ensure their correct integration. The first stage used a quantitative method aimed at identifying patient demographic data, emergency department (ED) utilization, and health care system factors utilizing a retrospective population-based survey. The second stage used qualitative data from patient exit surveys to establish patient perspectives. The third stage used key informant interviews to identify health care provider perspectives. Finally, the authors integrated the data obtained from various sources to establish the interactions among the different data sources and how they contribute to the critical research question. Utilizing multiple-method approaches increase the probability of accuracy and completeness of analysis and provide a comprehensive picture of study outcomes. 
However, this methodology has some drawbacks, such as the need to use different scientific methods, which requires several sets of equipment and well-trained personnel, increasing costs and time required for research. Moreover, integrating data from several different methods can become complex and time-consuming, especially because the merging, analyzing, and synthesis steps can be challenging, especially in cases where analysis hierarchies are not well established. The natures of quantitative and qualitative modes also differ, and the researchers must extremely cautious to avoid contradictory findings from the methodology.
Epistemological and Methodological Complexities of Multi-Strategy Research
Multi-strategy research is associated with numerous epistemological and methodological complexities, which must be considered when choosing a research methodology. The complexities of multi-strategy research involve issues of ontology, epistemology, ethics, and methodology. Ontology refers to the nature of reality and how it is perceived, while epistemology refers to knowledge and how it is acquired. Methodology, on the other hand, addresses how research questions are addressed and which tools and techniques are utilized.
Complexity analysis requires the measurement of research models according to the diversity and diversity of the systems under analysis. A methodology methodology, which involves the study of a unique object limited by the initial hypothesis and outlined in a specific context, is appropriate for conducting single- and multi-strategy research. The choice of methodology depends on the research question, objectives, and context. Consequently, when conducting multi-strategy research, the researcher must pay significant attention to selecting the appropriate method to meet the research objectives.
The appropriateness of a methodology can significantly affect the success of multi-strategy research. The integration of quantitative and qualitative data necessitates the attention of the researchers to ensure compatibility between the methodologies employed. In the study by Nelson and colleagues, the use of questionnaires, patient charts, and patient exit interviews helped to integrate the data effectively, thus resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of the research problem. However, the study required well-trained personnel and various equipment to run the multiple methodologies, highlighting the challenges associated with multi-strategy research. Similarly, single-strategy research requires extensive attention to detail the selected methodology, vital in ensuring successful research outcomes. Williams' study proves effective in exploring and understanding the nurses' perspective regarding quality nursing care, thanks to the well-planned technique used, making the research simpler.
Conclusion
In conclusion, both single- and multi-strategy research in nursing have their virtues and drawbacks, and the choice depends on the context, research questions, and objectives. Single-strategy research is easy to use, simple, and provides a focused view of research problems. On the other hand, multi-strategy research is more comprehensive but requires careful planning and execution and can be time-consuming and costly. Furthermore, multi-strategy research has numerous epistemological and methodological complexities such as ontology, epistemology, ethics, and methodology, which must be considered when choosing a research methodology. The studies used in this essay demonstrate the use of both single- and multi-strategy research in nursing and emphasize the importance of choosing the appropriate methodology, which can reinforce the research outcome's validity and leverage the benefits of multi-strategy research. Researchers need to be careful when choosing their research methodology, considering the inherent complexities and their ability to explore the research problem and provide appropriate solutions.
