The Model of Human Occupation (MOHO) is a well-established framework in the field of occupational therapy that seeks to explain how people participate in daily activities and how human occupation can be altered or improved through interventions. It is based on the idea that human occupation is influenced by three main factors: the person, the environment, and the occupation itself. This model holds great significance as it shapes the way occupational therapists approach intervention goals for their clients. In this essay, I will explore how the MOHO was used to create intervention goals for Greg, a 29-year-old man who was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia, and how his cultural and religious beliefs affected his treatment plan. 
Greg's case was referred to me by his psychiatrist, who had diagnosed him with schizophrenia six months ago.  At the time of assessment, Greg was highly symptomatic, with significant disruptions in his daily activities. His social functioning had been greatly affected, and he had also been struggling with finding and maintaining employment for the past few years. Greg's case was particularly challenging since it involved addressing his unique cultural and religious beliefs, which significantly influenced his views on mental health.
Initially, I used the MOHO to assess Greg's ability to engage in daily life activities. I conducted a thorough evaluation of his personal characteristics, environment, and the different occupations he was participating in. I also examined his performance patterns, including the daily routine and habits, skills and habits for discontinuing or initiating activities. Through this evaluation, I was able to identify Greg's strengths and limitations, which served as a foundation for developing strategies to improve his functional participation in life activities.
I utilized MOHO to create interventions goals for Greg, with a focus on improving his social functioning, work participation, and self-care. His treatment plan was developed with the aim of helping him achieve these goals, improving his mental state, and helping him achieve a better quality of life. Greg was actively involved in his treatment plan, contributing to the goal-setting process, and ensuring that they aligned with his values and beliefs.
Greg's cultural and religious beliefs played a significant role in his goal setting process. Being a person of South Asian descent, religion, and spirituality were of great importance to him. After gaining his trust, I learned about how his cultural and religious beliefs were affecting his perceptions of mental health, particularly with regards to taking medication. According to Greg, his religion did not promote the use of medication, and he was hesitant to take them. 
Therefore, the goal planning process had to be modified, taking into consideration Greg's cultural and religious beliefs. To help overcome his medication resistance in the short term, a plan was devised to educate Greg on the benefits of medications. The information would be tailored to address his cultural and religious beliefs and the risks and benefits of different types of medication, but was presented objectively by myself. Greg would then make his own informed decisions based on the values and cultural significance of his religion and family traditions.
Over time, in order to deal with ongoing compliance and concerns, a long-term plan was also established to address his reliance on medicine. In this approach, we focused on developing alternative and complementary therapies that complemented psychological therapy, medication, and Greg's beliefs. Applying art or music therapy, mindfulness and meditation, religious and spiritual guidance and traditional South Asian approaches to relaxation and mindfulness were discussed as possible alternative solutions to reliance on medication.
In the long-term plan, it was decided that Greg's faith leaders, family members, and friends would be educated on mental health and the importance of following prescribed medication guidelines. This approach recognized the significant role of the family in South Asian culture and their authority and influence over many decisions made by the individual and community.
The cultural and religious beliefs of Greg presented significant barriers for access to mental health care. It was therefore, imperative to include his family, faith leaders and inform them on the benefits of seeking medical help that would enable them to support him in his treatment. Without effective cultural competence and sensitivity, Greg would have discontinued his psychiatric medication without our knowledgeable guidance causing secondary effects of his schizophrenia to become more severe and eventually impacting his work and daily activities.
Legal and policy documents impact on the care of any patient, including Greg. Medical ethic codes, guidelines on medication and state laws, nursing care standards, and healthcare policies and regulations are all integral legal and policy documents that must be accounted for in his treatment. As a licensed occupational therapist, it is my responsibility to ensure that I adhere to these legal and regulatory frameworks.
One policy that affected Greg's care was the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This act outlines the way healthcare providers protect patient information, ensuring confidentiality and privacy with regard to medical records. To ensure this, confidentiality and empathy were reinforced with all interactions explicitly informing Greg of what information could to be shared with whom, and how his privacy and confidential records would be protected.
The Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act also played key roles in how Greg's care was accessed. These laws prevent discrimination against individuals with disabilities and ensure that reasonable accommodations are provided to allow equal access to services, housing, education, and employment. It is essential for healthcare providers to be mindful of these legal obligations, especially for those living with mental health conditions that affect their ability to participate in work-related activities. 
In conclusion, the MOHO framework was instrumental in shaping Greg's intervention goals, with a focus on understanding his occupation participation patterns and routines. To be successful, cultural beliefs and religious values had to be integrated into the treatment plan. The involvement of Greg, his family and faith leader created a consensus that allowed for custom care with alternative approaches and support of pharmacological interventions for his schizophrenia.  Legal and policy documents impacted regular communication with Greg effectively throughout his treatment, ensuring his privacy and the delivery marked with professional responsibilities and standards. Eventually, by appropriately supporting Greg, we could ensure that he was better equipped to take control of his life, mental health needs, have better social functioning and cope with the disappointments of everyday life.
