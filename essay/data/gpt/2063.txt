Marks and Spencer (M&S) is a renowned British retail store that caters to consumers from various socio-economic backgrounds. The external attributes of a product such as price, brand, store name, and country of product origin play a significant role in consumer behavior. These attributes have a substantial influence on the decision-making process of a consumer while shopping at M&S.
Price is one of the most essential external attributes of a product as it determines the affordability of the product for consumers from different socio-economic backgrounds. Consumers often have a perception that quality products come at a higher price. Therefore, consumers associate high prices with high-quality products, which leads them to expect better quality from products sold at M&S.
Brand reputation is another external attribute that influences the purchasing behavior of consumers. Consumers are more likely to trust a well-established brand and are more likely to purchase products from reputable brands. M&S has developed a strong brand reputation by providing high-quality products, which has established a sense of trust among consumers that the products sold by M&S are reliable and of good quality.
The store name is another essential external attribute that has a significant impact on consumers' purchasing behavior. A well-known store like M&S with a good reputation assures consumers of quality and reliability of the products sold. It also influences consumers to switch from competitors to a well-established retailer like M&S.
The country of product origin influences consumers' purchasing behavior, such as consumers from different socio-economic backgrounds prefer products that come from specific countries. For example, consumers from affluent backgrounds prefer products from high-end brands that come from developed countries, while consumers from less affluent backgrounds might prioritize inexpensive products, even if they are from developing countries. M&S offers a range of products made in the UK, which gives consumers the confidence that the products are of high quality.
The survey method chosen for studying the impact of external attributes on consumer behavior plays a vital role in obtaining accurate results. The chosen survey method should be reliable and valid to ensure that the results obtained are precise. Additionally, the sampling strategy also plays a crucial role in the study. The sampling strategy should be representative of the target population to avoid selection bias. For example, if the survey is meant to target all the consumers who shop at M&S, the sampling strategy should ensure that the results obtained are representative of the entire population of consumers who shop at M&S.
In conclusion, external product attributes like price, brand, store name, and country of product origin are vital factors that influence consumer behavior when shopping at Marks and Spencer (M&S). These attributes play a crucial role in consumer decision-making, and retailers can leverage them to craft effective marketing strategies. The choice of survey method and sampling strategy plays a crucial role in obtaining accurate results. Therefore, retailers like M&S must pay attention to these external attributes, as they can have a significant influence on their consumers.
