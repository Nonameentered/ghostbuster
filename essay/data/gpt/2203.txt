Introduction
Baby formula is a critical product for infants who require extra nutrition due to a host of health reasons. The industry is highly regulated, with several ethical standards in place to ensure that companies do not engage in unethical marketing. However, while there are guidelines, implementation is not universal globally. Nestle, the world's largest food company, has faced criticism over its baby formula marketing practices, particularly in developing countries. This essay evaluates the criteria that companies should be evaluated on in regards to marketing baby formula and the entity that should set ethical guidelines. Furthermore, it analyses the pros and cons of using national governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and market/consumer influence to set ethical standards in the baby formula industry, using the case of Nestle as an example to support the argument.
Criteria for Evaluating Ethical Marketing Practices in the Baby Formula Industry
The baby formula industry relies on accurate information and ethical marketing practices to inform professionals and parents/guardians to make informed purchasing decisions. To maintain ethical marketing practices, companies must adhere to established set criteria. Firstly, companies should base their marketing claims on scientific research and legitimate evidence. Second, marketing communications should be honest and transparent to provide adequate and factual information for parents/guardians to make informed purchasing decisions. Thirdly, companies should disclose all product information, including side effects and known risks. Fourthly, companies should strive to avoid marketing to vulnerable populations such as low-income families. Finally, companies should avoid making false claims regarding the superiority or comparative advantages of their products to discourage misleading information.
While most companies abide by these guidelines, some still violate them, especially in developing countries, where stringent regulations are not enforced. For instance, some baby formula manufacturers directly target low-income families in low-income countries, making unfounded and erroneous claims regarding the product's superiority that misleads the public. To mitigate these unethical marketing practices, regulatory bodies and entities must be established to oversee and evaluate a company's marketing and advertising practices. As such, the question of who should set the ethical guidelines for an industry arises.
Setting Guidelines for Ethical Standards in the Baby Formula Industry
Regulating bodies are critical to ensure that companies comply with ethical marketing principles and guidelines. Therefore, the question of who should oversee the ethical standards in the baby formula industry is significant. Three entities can foster ethical standards in the industry: national governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and market/consumer influence.
National Governments
National governments can impose regulations to set a comprehensive framework for ethical standards regarding the marketing of baby formula to ensure companies' compliance with local laws. Governments play a considerable role in regulating not only how products are sold but also how they are made and advertised. By enforcing these regulatory standards, companies are held accountable for advertising baby formula ethically. National governments work with regulatory bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) to establish universal standards for the marketing of baby formula. For instance, the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, created by the WHO and UNICEF, establishes ethical marketing guidelines and protects breastfeeding.
While government regulation aids in fostering ethical standards in the baby formula industry, several barriers hinder its efficacy. In some countries, regulatory frameworks are weak, and companies can manipulate regulatory councils through lengthy legal proceedings. Additionally, political conflicts and corruption can incentivize government officials to overlook critical marketing and advertising regulations.
Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs)
NGOs such as the Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) and Save the Children work alongside the WHO to establish ethical standards in baby formula marketing. NGOs engage in several projects to encourage breastfeeding and improve nutrition in infants in developing countries. For instance, the BFHI promotes the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative Program, a project that helps hospitals become certified as 'baby-friendly, ensuring all mothers receive unbiased information about infant nutrition and breastfeeding. NGOs also establish breastfeeding support groups, educate families on mother-to-mother care for breastfeeding support, and provide resources for training and education to healthcare professionals.
NGOs operate without political influence and prioritize the needs of infants and their mothers. They complement the work of national governments by providing alternate voices in situations where regulatory councils are not implementing ethical standards for wholesome business practices. However, while NGOs can foster ethical standards in the baby formula industry, their influence is limited to individual projects and is not permanent. Furthermore, NGOs lack the authority to impose enforceable standards across the entire industry.
Market/Consumer Influence
Market/consumer trends can also shape ethical standards in the baby formula industry. Companies recognize that consumers' purchasing patterns directly correlate with their marketing and advertising practices, and therefore, adapt their practices accordingly. Market forces shape the regulation of such industries by encouraging ethical practices that demonstrate wholesome business practices. For instance, in response to Nestle's unethical baby formula marketing practices in the 1970s, consumer boycotts of Nestle products helped spark the implementation of ethical marketing regulations.
However, market/consumer trends carry the risk of setback because they rely on individual and sporadic acts of spontaneous consumer behavior. Moreover, these strategies depend on buy-in from a smaller segment of consumers, and they may not effectively impact larger public opinion regarding the product. Additionally, in situations such as getting vital nutrition for infants, relying on market/consumer trends may not suffice without an established regulatory framework to evaluate and implement ethical standards in the industry.
Nestle Case Study
One of the primary proponents of unethical marketing practices in the baby formula industry is Nestle, the world's largest food company. Nestle faced backlash in the 1970s for promoting unethical baby formula marketing practices in low-income countries. For instance, Nestle directly targeted low-income mothers with infant-formula samples and, in some cases, disguised the formula samples as gifts. Consequently, mothers would purchase the formula when they could not afford it later, leading to malnutrition in infants because they could not sustain the purchase. To mitigate these disturbing marketing practices, the WHO developed the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes in 1981, which banned many of Nestle's unethical marketing practices.
Despite the existence of regulations, Nestle has been accused of subsequent unethical advertising and marketing practices. Such practices include falsely promoting baby formulas as "superior" or "recommended by experts." These claims harm infantsâ€™ health by influencing the public against breastfeeding, leading to increased infant mortality rates. Nestle continues to face criticism, especially in developing countries, for its unethical marketing practices.
Conclusion
The baby formula industry heavily relies on ethical marketing practices to inform consumers about their products. The industry must abide by clear ethical standards, limiting unethical advertising practices that mislead parents and negatively impact infant nutrition. Government regulation, NGOs, and market/consumer influence are the top contenders to foster ethical standards in the baby formula industry. However, all three approaches face specific drawbacks that require clear and distinct considerations to establish global standards. Ethical standards must prioritize the health and well-being of infants and mothers above all else. Nestle's experience with unethical marketing practices highlights the need for stringent regulations that global entities can enforce to prevent damaging business practices. Ultimately, companies must prioritize ethical marketing practices in the interest of maintaining the good health of infants and their mothers.
