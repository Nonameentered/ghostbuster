The Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) system is a system used to determine the quality of water by giving a numerical score to the biological communities discovered in rivers and other bodies of water. It aims to provide an indication of the health of the aquatic ecosystem by identifying and evaluating the presence and abundance of different species of invertebrates that live in the water.
The BMWP system was initially developed in the United Kingdom in the 1970s and has since become a standard method for assessing the quality of water. It is based on the principle that the presence of certain types of invertebrates in a river or stream is an indicator of the water quality, and the absence of some species can be used to infer that the water quality could be negatively impacted by certain pollutants. This system is popular among many water monitoring agencies because it's easy to understand and apply.
The BMWP system relies on the collection of small invertebrates from the water and their examination under a microscope to determine their identity. These invertebrates include different types of mayflies, stoneflies, and caddisflies, which are known to be sensitive to pollution and environmental changes. The scores given to each species are produced by counting the number of individuals of each species present and multiplying it by a weighting factor that reflects its sensitivity to environmental change and pollution.
The species score is then combined to give an overall score for the water system. The higher the score, the better the water quality of the river or stream, and vice versa. A score of 100 would be given to a site where sensitive invertebrate species, such as the Baetis mayfly, are present in large numbers. On the other hand, a low score of 0 would be given to a site where almost all the invertebrates present belong to tolerant or pollutant-tolerant species such as the chironomid midge.
A major limitation of the BMWP system is that it's primarily designed to detect specific pollutants that are known to harm water quality. This system could miss other pollutants that don't affect the species of invertebrates being monitored. For example, water systems that have high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, which can promote the growth of algae that choke water systems, may still score highly on the BMWP system, making it difficult to detect these pollutants.
Another limitation of the BMWP system is that it may not detect some toxic materials. It only detects living organisms and their sensitivity to pollution. This means that if there are toxins in the water that have affected the invertebrate population and killed them, the BMWP score may not be as low as it should. In simple terms, if the invertebrate population is low or absent for unknown reasons, including possible poisoning, there is no way to know for sure if the water quality is poor.
Lastly, the BMWP system can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the populations of the invertebrates. This makes it challenging to use the system precisely in areas where the weather and climate change drastically. During seasons when the population of different species increases, the BMWP score could rise even in water systems with high levels of pollution, making it difficult to determine the impact of different pollutants.
In conclusion, the BMWP system is an important tool for water quality assessment, and its significance cannot be overemphasized; however, the system does have some limitations that need to be taken into account when relying on it. The BMWP system's application also highlights the need for innovative ways of evaluating water quality, especially as water pollution continues to pose a significant threat to the environment and the organisms that depend on it. New systems should address the shortcomings of the BMWP system, which include the need to detect additional pollutants, factors that can reduce the invertebrate population like poisoning, and the changing climate and environments. Ultimately, improving water quality management would prevent hindered growth and development of humans and aquatic life dependent on water bodies.
