Introduction
The conquest of the Inca Empire by the Spanish in 1532 marked a significant period in the history of evangelization in South America. The indigenous people of the Inca Empire, who had their own unique religion and spiritual beliefs, were exposed to Christianity by the Spanish colonizers. The role of evangelization during the conquest changed from being solely religious to being a political expedient for the Spanish colonizers. This essay explores how the role of evangelization changed during the conquest and why it became a political expedient for the Spanish colonizers.
Evangelization before the conquest
Before the arrival of the Spanish, the Inca Empire was a vast and powerful civilization that had its own religion and spiritual beliefs. The Incas believed in a pantheon of gods who protected them and provided them with bountiful harvests. The Inca religion was very hierarchical, with the emperor at the top of the religious hierarchy. The emperor was considered to be the son of the sun, and his role was to ensure that the Inca people were in harmony with their gods.
The Spanish colonizers arrived in the Inca Empire with the intention of converting the Inca people to Christianity. The Catholic Church had sent missionaries to South America with the mission of bringing Christianity to the indigenous people of the region. The missionaries saw the Inca religion as pagan and idolatrous, and they believed that the Incas needed to be converted to Christianity before they could be saved.
The role of evangelization during the conquest
During the conquest of the Inca Empire, the role of evangelization changed from being solely religious to being a political expedient for the Spanish colonizers. The Spanish realized that the conversion of the Inca people to Christianity would be an effective way to control them. The Spanish colonizers understood the importance of religion to the Inca people and used it to their advantage. The Spanish offered Christianity to the Inca people as a way to live peacefully and enjoy the protection of the Spanish crown.
The Spanish also realized that the conversion of the Inca people would be an effective way to create a new social order. The Inca Empire was a highly stratified society, with the emperor at the top of the social hierarchy. The Spanish used their religion to create a new social order, with the Spanish at the top of the social hierarchy. The Spanish justified their rule over the Inca people by saying that they were the chosen people of God and had a divine right to rule.
The Spanish also used evangelization as a way to extract resources from the Inca Empire. The Spanish colonizers saw the Inca Empire as a source of wealth, and they used their religion to justify their conquest. They claimed that they were bringing Christianity to the Inca people, and in exchange, the Inca people should give the Spanish colonizers their gold and silver. The conversion of the Inca people to Christianity was an effective way to justify the exploitation of the Inca Empire.
Furthermore, the Spanish used military conquest and religion to establish their rule over the Inca people. The Spanish quickly realized that they could not conquer the Inca Empire with force alone. The Incas were skilled warriors, and they had a well-organized army. The Spanish used their religion to gain the support of the Inca people and to weaken the Inca army. The Spanish promised the Inca people protection in exchange for their conversion to Christianity. The Spanish also promised to protect the Inca people from their enemies, including rival tribes and neighboring empires.
