Angela Carter's The Magic Toyshop employs a range of mythological and fairytale elements to criticize and challenge the male-dominated world prevalent at the time. Through her characters, particularly Uncle Philip and Finn, and by utilizing the myth of Leda and the Swan, Carter subverts stereotypical roles of men and women, and highlights the patriarchal nature of societal norms. The novel recognizes traditional fairytale conventions and tweaks them to deliver a pointed message. While some argue that Carter fails to provide an alternative to the patriarchal society, I believe her purpose was to establish that the first step to change is recognizing the need for change itself.
The Magic Toyshop is set in a distinctively patriarchal society, and Uncle Philip, the primary male character, exemplifies its typical characteristics. Uncle Philip is a wealthy and influential man who governs the behavior, attitudes, and prejudices of the characters. In this sense, he is a father figure who represents the controlling patriarchy. He exercises authority and control over the women in the story, including his wife, Margaret, and his teenage nieces, Melanie and Victoria. Uncle Philip's tyranny is exemplified by his creation of the toyshop, a place where all the characters are forced to work, and from which there is no escape. The toyshop's enclosed environment symbolizes the oppressive patriarchal society within which the women are trapped, unable to escape from their daily routines or explore the world outside. Uncle Philip also embodies the repressive and cold-hearted male-dominated society, where men are preoccupied with power and authority and women are expected to be submissive and accommodating.
In contrast to Uncle Philip, Finn represents a subverted male identity. He opposes and challenges traditional male roles and exercises patriarchal authority through violent behavior. He is initially an outlaw who breaks into the toyshop, contrasting with Uncle Philip's habit of locking people in. Finn's disruptive presence in the toyshop sheds light on the novel's political aspect by showing that resistance is essential for change. Unlike Uncle Philip, who is ashamed of his physical appearance and seeks to hide, Finn is proud of his strength and masculinity. However, his masculinity is slightly subverted when he is painted as a vulnerable male who depends on the love and care of women. His masculinity isn't a threat like Uncle Philip's, but rather a force to be celebrated and nurtured. Finn's non-conformity to expected societal expectations for men is a significant deviation from his peers.
The story Leda and the Swan further emphasizes the novel's feminist critique of a male-dominated world. The myth of Leda and the Swan places the male at its center and represents it as a symbol of masculinity. The mythologized male swoops in, disrupts the peaceable reproductive orders, and subjects Leda to a violent, coercive act. The myth, like patriarchal society, is criticized by the book. However, Carter alters the role of the male in the myth by challenging the conventional male identity. Finn replaces the swan, which dispels the violent, masculine, and sexually dominant male archetypes. Instead, Carter presents a male character who advocates for love, nurturing, and supporting the female characters and representing society's better aspects.
Angela Carter subverts the traditional fairytale conventions in The Magic Toyshop remarkably. Typically, fairytales follow literary trends of having a beautiful and kind-hearted young woman who requires rescuing by an attractive prince. The prince is often ruggedly masculine, displaying heroic status by rescuing the damsel in distress. Carter upends the conventional roles by having Melanie save Finn from a tiger at a circus, with Finn in a weakened and vulnerable state. Finn's masculinity is thus subverted, exhibiting a different male archetype contrary to traditional masculine roles.
While Carter does not explicitly provide an alternative to the male-dominated society she critiques, she provides clues through her text. Her purpose is not to indicate or provide answers, but rather to provoke questioning and thought. In essence, her critique seeks to show that the first step in effecting change is to recognize a problem. By subverting traditional fairytale tropes and presenting complex male characters that challenge traditional masculinity, Carter highlights that society needs to expand its definitions of normalcy. She suggests alternative ways of redefining gender roles so that women are not bound by conventions that hinder their development. Carter shows that it is critical to seek for non-conventional and alternative ways of thinking and living but does not provide an explicit blueprint for this.
In conclusion, Angela Carter's The Magic Toyshop uses mythological and fairytale elements to expose and challenge the male-dominated society. The novel's two male characters, Uncle Philip and Finn, stand out as representations of traditional male archetypes and a subverted version of masculinity, respectively, to highlight societal norms and attitudes. Carter also tweaks traditional fairytale tropes to subvert expected gender roles and demonstrate the necessity of change. While some may critique Carter for not providing an alternative, her book's purpose was to get people questioning assumptions, conventions, and gender roles, ultimately contributing to societal progress. The Magic Toyshop does not offer a particular direction, but it plants a seed of thought that eventually blooms into meaningful societal change.
