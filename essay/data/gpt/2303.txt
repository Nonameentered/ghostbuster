Introduction
The pre-cautionary principle is an approach used in decision-making that advocates for the use of caution in the face of uncertainty with the aim of protecting public health and the environment. The World Trade Organization's Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement outlines this principle's application in international trade regarding food safety and animal and plant health. The principle is viewed by proponents as imperative in mitigating risks that could adversely affect public health or environmental quality. However, the approach has also been met with criticism, mainly by those who argue that it may lead to trade barriers and could be used as a guise by some countries to execute trade protectionism. This paper will delve into the precautionary principle in the framework of the SPS Agreement, exploring how it relates to international trade policies and public health and environmental concerns, providing examples of situations where the principle has been applied and explain how the principle is viewed by both proponents and critics.
The Precautionary Principle in the SPS Agreement
The SPS Agreement is a critical component of the World Trade Organization (WTO) that outlines food safety, plant health, and animal health standards governing international trade. Members are mandated to ensure that their food safety measures, including inspection, testing, labeling, and certification requirements, are based on science. In essence, they must meet the minimum standards of food safety applicable globally. The SPS Agreement provides a framework for addressing health concerns associated with agricultural commodities traded internationally. It ensures that any new or existing food safety standards are based on clear and verifiable Scientific evidence. In cases where scientific evidence is lacking, the WTO outlines the use of the precautionary principle.
The precautionary principle is articulated in Article 5.7 of the SPS Agreement, which states that; " In cases where relevant scientific evidence is insufficient, a Member may provisionally adopt risk management measures on the basis of available pertinent information, including *** that of a scientific nature." This article provides that members may adopt provisional measures based on limited scientific evidence with the aim of mitigating potential health risks to humans, animals, and plants. Although provisional measures adopted under the pre-cautionary principle are subject to review, they can potentially impact trade because they represent trade barriers aimed at protecting the environment or public health within a country. For countries to impose trade barriers based on the pre-cautionary principle, they must comply with the WTO's rules to avoid trade discrimination or breaches of the SPS Agreement.
Relationship between the Pre-Cautionary Principle and International Trade Policies and Public Health and Environmental Protection
The application of the pre-cautionary principle raises issues relating to public health and environmental protection, as well as international trade policies. Food safety is one of the most crucial areas where the principle is applied under the SPS Agreement because food products are traded globally, exposing consumers to potential health risks. Implementation of the pre-cautionary principle in the food industry has resulted in trade restrictions that have had an impact on international trade policies and public health.
The pre-cautionary principle's adoption globally has allowed the implementation of strict food safety measures, especially in developed countries. For example, following the BSE crisis in the UK in the 1990s, the EU imposed a ban on the sales of beef produced in the UK. The ban was lifted after almost six years after the UK adopted measures to address the BSE situation (European Commission, 1997). The application of the pre-cautionary principle resulted in trade restrictions, demonstrating how the principle has been used to restrict the flow of some agricultural commodities from one country to another. In this case, the UK's beef ban cost the country's economy billions of pounds, and it highlights the impact of the pre-cautionary principle on international trade. 
The pre-cautionary principle's application has also been seen in environmental protection measures. In the case of GMO's in the EU, the pre-cautionary principle was applied to justify the EU's regulatory approach towards GMO's. In 1998, the EU established the "Novel Foods Regulation" aimed at regulating GMO products' production and marketing in the EU. The pre-cautionary principle was used as a basis for the regulation, arguing that the existing information on the safety of GMO's was not sufficient, and the EU could not unravel the long-term effects of GMO's (Andersen et al., 2012). Critics argue that the EU's approach to GMO's under the pre-cautionary principle is more due to political reasons than any scientific evidence. Nonetheless, the EU has continued to implement the pre-cautionary principle, with the regulation being an essential part of the EU's environmental protection measures.
Examples of Pre-Cautionary Principle Applications
The pre-cautionary principle has been applied in various areas, including climate change, food safety, animal welfare, and environmental protection. In the area of climate change, the pre-cautionary principle was used during the development of the Kyoto protocol. The protocol's objective was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit climate change. The UNFCCC Conference of Parties agreed that countries should take account of the pre-cautionary principle in developing and implementing measures aimed at mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The pre-cautionary principle's application in this area emphasizes the importance of being proactive in dealing with potential risks and acting before the risks increase.
Another area where the pre-cautionary principle has been used is in the evaluation of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. In this case, the pre-cautionary principle outlines the requirements for the evaluation and approval of new medical devices and drugs before being put into the market (Renn & Levine, 1991). The principle is used to determine the potential risks and benefits associated with a product before it is made available to consumers. Through the application of the pre-cautionary principle, consumers are protected from the potential risks associated with drugs and medical devices that have not gone through the required evaluation and approval processes.
Viewpoints by Proponents and Critics of the Pre-Cautionary Principle
Proponents of the pre-cautionary principle argue that it is critical in dealing with health and environmental risks. They believe that the principle is an important risk management tool, especially in cases where scientific evidence is not conclusive. They argue that the principle reflects a responsible and precautionary approach to protect people's health and the environment. The pre-cautionary principle, they argue, has resulted in important health and environmental protection regulations, and its widespread adoption has resulted in the reduction of risks to public health.
Critics of the pre-cautionary principle argue that it is used as a guise for trade protectionism, especially by developed countries. They argue that politicians often invoke the principle to enact protectionist measures to protect their markets from developing countries. The critics argue that the principle's application has resulted in the imposition of unnecessary trade barriers, resulting in trade distortions with potential economic impacts. They argue that the principle has been used to justify regulations that have little or no scientific basis, leading to the adoption of regulations that are overly restrictive. They further argue that the principle has resulted in unnecessary economic costs that could otherwise be avoided.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the pre-cautionary principle is a vital tool in decision-making, especially in cases where scientific evidence is limited. Its application under the SPS Agreement is critical in addressing health concerns arising from agricultural commodities traded globally. However, the principle's application raises issues related to international trade policies and public health and environmental protection. The pre-cautionary principle has been applied in various areas, ranging from climate change to evaluation of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Proponents of the principle argue that it is a crucial risk management tool, while its critics argue that it is often used as a guise for trade protectionism, resulting in unnecessary trade restrictions. In conclusion, the pre-cautionary principle's application must be based on clear scientific evidence to avoid unnecessary trade barriers and their possible economic implications.
