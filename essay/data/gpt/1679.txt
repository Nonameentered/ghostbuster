The hospitality and tourism industry is a labor-intensive industry that requires skilled and motivated employees to provide high-quality services to customers. Recruitment and selection are essential processes in the industry, and organizations must adopt effective strategies to attract the best talent. The recruitment process involves identifying the need for employees, advertising vacancies, screening and shortlisting candidates, conducting interviews, and selecting the best candidate for the job. On the other hand, selection involves making decisions about job offers and negotiating contracts with successful candidates.
HRM strategies are critical in achieving employee fit and developing effective recruitment and selection practices. Employee fit refers to the match between the job requirements and the characteristics of the employees, including skills, attitudes, and behaviors. Diversity and inclusion are crucial considerations in achieving employee fit, as organizations seek to hire employees that reflect the diverse nature of their customers. HRM strategies such as job analysis, job descriptions, and person specifications are used to identify the skills, knowledge, and personal qualities required for a job. These strategies are useful in ensuring that the recruitment and selection process focuses on the essential requirements for the job, and that candidates are selected based on their ability to meet these requirements.
Industry characteristics such as high levels of competition and a high turnover of staff also impact HRM strategies in recruitment and selection. Organizations must be innovative in their recruitment and selection strategies to attract and retain the best talent in the industry. For instance, some organizations offer incentives such as housing and travel allowances, bonuses, and flexible working hours to attract and retain employees. Other organizations invest in training and development programs to enhance the skills of their employees and increase their loyalty to the organization.
Objectivity in the recruitment and selection process is essential in avoiding discrimination towards minorities. Discrimination can include any unfavorable treatment of an individual based on factors such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, or religion. Discrimination can be overt or covert, and can occur at any stage of the recruitment and selection process. Organizations must ensure that their recruitment and selection processes are objective, fair, and transparent, to avoid unintentional discrimination. For instance, the use of standardized selection tests, structured interviews, and blind resume reviews can help to promote objectivity in the recruitment and selection process.
Recruitment and selection methods in the hospitality and tourism industry can be subjective or objective, depending on the HRM strategy of the organization. Objective methods involve the use of standardized tests, structured interviews, and other objective measures to assess candidate suitability. Subjective methods involve the assessment of candidate suitability based on more subjective measures such as personal qualities and fit with the organizational culture. The right mix of recruitment and selection methods is dependent on the HRM strategy of the organization. For instance, organizations with a strong focus on culture and fit may adopt more subjective recruitment and selection methods, while organizations with a strong focus on competency and technical skills may adopt more objective methods.
Training and development are essential for recruitment and selection in the hospitality and tourism industry. The industry is fast-paced and rapidly changing, and employees need to be continually trained and developed to keep up with changing customer needs and expectations. Training and development programs can also play a critical role in promoting employee alignment with the organizational culture and values. Organizations can adopt different training and development strategies, such as on-the-job training, mentoring programs, and formal training programs, to enhance employee skills and improve job performance.
Commitment and productivity are essential considerations in the recruitment and selection process in the hospitality and tourism industry. The industry is known for its long working hours, which can be challenging for employees. Organizations must ensure that they recruit employees who are committed to their jobs and are willing to work long hours when required. At the same time, organizations must also ensure that employees are productive and can deliver high-quality services to customers. High levels of productivity can be achieved through effective training and development programs, the provision of incentives and rewards, and the use of performance-based pay.
Finally, seasonality has a significant impact on recruitment and selection in the hospitality and tourism industry. The industry is highly seasonal, and organizations must adopt recruitment and selection strategies that can respond to changing staffing needs. During peak seasons, organizations must recruit and retain a large number of employees to cater to the increased demand for services. At the same time, during the off-season, organizations must manage their staffing levels to avoid over-staffing and minimize labor costs.

HRM strategies such as job analysis, job descriptions, and person specifications are used to identify the essential requirements for a job, while diversity and inclusion are critical considerations in achieving employee fit.
