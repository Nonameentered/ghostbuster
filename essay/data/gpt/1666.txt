The sonnet is a poetic form that has become infamous for its ability to convey deep and complex emotions in a compressed format. In "The Kaleidoscope" by Louise Glück and "On Re-Recording Mozart" by W. S. Merwin, the sonnet form is used to explore the themes of death and bereavement. Although both poems share a common topic, they differ in their use of meter and rhyme and their structural differences, which impact how these emotions are conveyed. This essay will compare and contrast the use of the sonnet in both poems, and analyze how these features convey their complex emotions.
In "The Kaleidoscope," Louise Glück explores the theme of death through the metaphor of a kaleidoscope. The speaker reflects on a seemingly meaningless series of images that represent the chaos of life, which then becomes rearranged into a pattern when viewed through a kaleidoscope. However, this pattern is fleeting, as the kaleidoscope ultimately falls apart, leaving the speaker in despair. Glück employs a strict iambic pentameter in "The Kaleidoscope," which creates a rhythmic and lyrical quality to the poem. The regularity of the meter is contrasted with the content of the poem, which depicts the chaos and disorder of life. This contrast highlights the theme of death and the inevitability of chaos and decay.
Moreover, the rhyme scheme of "The Kaleidoscope" is ABBA ABBA CDC DCD, which is a Petrarchan sonnet form. This form is traditionally used to explore love and relationships, but Glück uses it to explore death and the fleetingness of life. The ABBA ABBA rhyme scheme creates a sense of musicality in the poem, contributing to its lyricism and lending an air of finality to the lines that conclude the poem.
On the other hand, in "On Re-Recording Mozart," W. S Merwin explores the theme of bereavement, specifically the loss of his son. The speaker reflects on the attempt to immortalize his son through recording a piece of music, only to realize that it is futile. The poem employs a looser meter than "The Kaleidoscope," with variable line lengths and irregular stresses. This contributes to the poem's free-flowing style, which echoes the emotional turmoil of the speaker as he reflects on the loss of his son.
Furthermore, the rhyme scheme of "On Re-Recording Mozart" is also looser and more irregular than "The Kaleidoscope." The poem uses a rhyme scheme of ABAC CDC DCC EFE and is divided into three quatrains and a final couplet. This structure is similar to that of a Shakespearean sonnet, though the final couplet is separated from the preceding lines. This structural difference, combined with the irregular rhyme scheme, creates a sense of fragmentation and disconnect that reflects the speaker's feelings of mourning and emptiness.
In conclusion, while both "The Kaleidoscope" and "On Re-Recording Mozart" employ the sonnet form to explore themes related to death and bereavement, they differ in their use of meter, rhyme, and structure. In "The Kaleidoscope," Louise Glück employs a stricter meter and Petrarchan rhyme scheme to create a lyrical and musical quality to the poem, while in "On Re-Recording Mozart," W. S. Merwin employs a looser meter and irregular rhyme scheme to create a free-flowing and fragmented style that reflects the emotional turmoil of the speaker. These differences reflect the differing approaches to dealing with loss and death. Ultimately, both poets successfully use the sonnet form to convey their complex emotions, highlighting the versatility of this poetic form.
