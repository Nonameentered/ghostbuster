Introduction
The isoelectric point (pI) is an important characteristic of proteins that describes the pH value where the protein has a net charge of zero. The determination of the isoelectric point of proteins has significant implications in various fields, including biotechnology, food industry, and pharmaceuticals. In this essay, we will discuss the methodologies used to determine the isoelectric point of casein, the results of the experiment, and the electrophoretogram of haemoglobin and cytochrome c.
Methodologies for determining the isoelectric point of casein
Casein is a primary protein found in milk, and it is essential in the formation of cheese. The determination of the isoelectric point of casein is useful in the milk industry, particularly in the separation of protein from whey. There are various methodologies for determining the isoelectric point of casein. One of which is the pH-stat method, which is based on the neutralization of an acidic solution (Duan et al., 2015). In this method, a casein solution with a known concentration is titrated with an acid or a base, and the pH value is recorded continually. During titration, the pH changes until there is an equal number of positive and negative charges in the solution, giving the protein a net charge of zero. The pH value at which this occurs represents the isoelectric point of the protein.
Another methodology is the electrophoretic method, which uses an electrophoresis apparatus to separate proteins based on their charge and size (Hatakeyama et al., 2018). In this method, a casein solution is loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel and subjected to an electric field. During electrophoresis, the casein molecules move toward the electrode with an opposite charge, and the gel is stained with Coomassie blue to visualize the protein bands. The pH gradient of the gel allows for the detection of the isoelectric point, which is the point where the protein band is stationary.
Results of isoelectric point of casein experiment
Several studies have evaluated the isoelectric point of casein using different methodologies. In one study, Li et al. (2014) used the pH-stat method to determine the isoelectric point of casein from yak milk. They found that the isoelectric point of casein was 4.6 ± 0.01, which is consistent with previous studies that used the same methodology (Yang et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2013).
In another study, Liu et al. (2017) used the electrophoretic method to determine the isoelectric point of casein from donkey milk. They found that the isoelectric point of casein was 4.8 ± 0.01, which is slightly higher than the values reported in previous studies.
Overall, the determination of the isoelectric point of casein is important in the milk industry, particularly in cheese production. The pH-stat and electrophoretic methods are both effective methodologies for determining the isoelectric point of casein, and the results obtained from different studies are comparable.
Electrophoretogram of haemoglobin and cytochrome c
Haemoglobin and cytochrome c are both important proteins in the human body. Haemoglobin is a protein found in red blood cells that is responsible for transporting oxygen to different tissues and organs. Cytochrome c is a protein found in the mitochondria that is involved in energy production. The electrophoretogram of these proteins can provide important information about their molecular weight, charge, and structure.
Haemoglobin is a complex protein made up of four subunits that each contain a heme group. The electrophoresis of haemoglobin can be performed using a gel that separates the protein based on its charge and size. In an electrophoretogram of haemoglobin, four bands can be observed representing the different subunits of the protein (Miglietta et al., 2016). The molecular weight of haemoglobin is 64,000 Da, and its isoelectric point is around 7.0 (Shi et al., 2018). The electrophoresis of haemoglobin can provide important information about protein disorders such as sickle cell anemia, where abnormal band patterns can be detected (Kumar et al., 2018).
Cytochrome c is a heme-containing protein that plays a vital role in cellular respiration. The electrophoresis of cytochrome c can be performed using a gel that separates the protein based on its charge and size. In an electrophoretogram of cytochrome c, a single band can be observed representing the protein (Murphy et al., 2015). The molecular weight of cytochrome c is 12,327 Da, and its isoelectric point is around 10 (Baker et al., 2017). The electrophoresis of cytochrome c can provide important information about mitochondrial disorders where changes in band patterns can be detected (Nagaraj et al., 2017).
Conclusion
In conclusion, the determination of the isoelectric point of proteins is an essential characteristic that has significant implications in various fields. The isoelectric point can be determined using different methodologies, such as the pH-stat and electrophoretic methods. The isoelectric point of casein has been evaluated in various studies, with the results being consistent across different methodologies. The electrophoretogram of haemoglobin and cytochrome c can provide important information about their molecular weight, charge, and structure. The identification of abnormal band patterns can provide valuable information about protein disorders and mitochondrial disorders. Overall, the methodologies used to determine the isoelectric point of casein and the electrophoretogram of haemoglobin and cytochrome c provide valuable information about proteins that have significant implications in various fields.
