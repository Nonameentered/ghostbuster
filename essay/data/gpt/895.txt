Online catalogues provide invaluable information to users who seek to learn about and purchase specific items. A plant online catalogue, for instance, offers insight into plants' features, their growth patterns, and their optimal conditions. However, online catalogues require powerful search engines to provide the most appropriate results to their users. Hash tables and AVL trees are two popular data structures used to store search results. This essay will examine the factors that were considered in the design of a hash table for a specific plant online catalogue and why it was chosen over an AVL tree.
Hash tables are a data structure that utilizes key-value pairs to store information. The hashing function assigns each key to a specific address in an array. It allows for efficient searching and retrieving of values by utilizing the hash key to point the address on the memory space, resulting in the retrieval of the required value in a constant amount of time, or O(1). This is an important feature when an application needs to store, search, and query vast amounts of data quickly. 
One of the most crucial factors that were considered in the design of a hash table for a specific plant online catalogue was efficiency. As previously mentioned, hash tables have a search time of O(1), making them extremely efficient. Hash tables allow for quick searches when several items have the same key values. One common way to address this is called "collision resolution," which uses different methods to map the items into different buckets. These methods include open addressing where the algorithm tries to find the next empty bucket or chaining where new entries are created as a linked list in the same bucket.
In comparison, AVL trees have a search time of log n (n being the number of data items in the AVL tree) in average cases, while in complex cases, like skewed trees, the performance will be worse. AVL trees utilize a binary search process, requiring multiple comparisons to get to the desired value. Given that plant online catalogues have thousands of plants to keep track of, a hash table with its O(1) search time was chosen since it could provide faster results as the size of the catalogue increased.
Another factor considered when designing a hash table for a plant online catalogue was the ease of implementation. Hash tables do not require a lot of implementation or programming steps to create. As a result, fewer technical errors are likely to occur while developing a hash table. In contrast, AVL trees require careful coding and precise insertion of data. A single error in programming can cause the code to malfunction, which can lead to problems such as segmentation faults, compiler errors, stack-trace, and program crashes. Given that the implementation phase of development has a significant impact on the longevity of the application, a hash table was chosen because it is easier to implement and has a lower risk of errors.
The maintenance of the hash table was another factor that was considered. Maintenance refers to the management of data operations, deletion, and modification of registered data. One attribute of hash tables is that once the hash value has been calculated, lesser computational power is required than is needed in AVL trees since hash keys are unchanging, resulting in reduced overhead. 
Also, the majority of operations in AVL trees require pointer manipulation, making it necessary to continually realign the tree structure during modifications. Consequently, this leads to increased effort and time in maintaining the structure. A hash table, on the other hand, has a more straightforward implementation with faster maintenance operations, making it a better choice for the plant online catalogue.
Another factor considered in the design of the hash table was the space needed to store the data. A specific feature of hash tables is that the amount of essential space is proportional to the number of data items stored within the table. This feature makes the hash table more scalable and permits the storage of a vast amount of data compared to AVL trees. AVL trees' memory usage increases as the number of data points grows, by design, as the tree needs to be balanced. As a result, AVL trees can perform poorly space-wise, which is a disadvantage for plant online catalogues with a large quantity of data.
In conclusion, several factors were considered in the design of a hash table for a specific plant online catalogue. The primary factor was efficiency, which is essential since plant online catalogues contain a large amount of data. In terms of implementation and maintenance, hash tables had an advantage over AVL trees. Hash tables required less coding and fewer checks, resulting in fewer errors and easy removal of data. Finally, considerations over space played a crucial role in deciding upon the hash table as the better choice. Hash tables scale better since memory consumption is proportional to the number of data items stored. Overall, considering these factors, a hash table was chosen over an AVL tree for its speed, scalability, memory usage, and ease of implementation and maintenance.
