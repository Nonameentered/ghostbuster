In the world of business, planning and executing strategies play a vital role in achieving the organization's objectives. The decisions made by organizations in formulating and implementing strategies can impact its success in the market. The two primary approaches to strategy are deliberate and emergent, which have their advantages and disadvantages.
The deliberate strategy is a planned, proactive approach to creating a strategic position. It involves a thorough process of analysis, planning, and implementation of actions that are intended to achieve the company's goals. The deliberate strategy involves a top-down approach, where the management team chooses the direction of the company and sets goals that everyone works towards achieving. Companies with a deliberate strategy are highly structured, with standard processes, policies, and procedures. 
One example of a company that has used a deliberate strategy to its advantage is Honda Motors. Under the leadership of Soichiro Honda, the company focused on producing high-quality products at affordable prices, focusing on the niche market of small cars and motorcycles. His vision was to make Honda a company that the ordinary person could afford, and he had a clear plan to achieve this goal. Honda's team identified a gap in the market, and the company's deliberate strategy of producing small, fuel-efficient cars helped it achieve enormous success.
One of the advantages of the deliberate strategy is that it allows companies to set a clear direction for the organization. All members understand the company's goals and objectives, and everyone works towards achieving them, resulting in a cohesive team effort. Another advantage is that the deliberate strategy helps companies to anticipate market changes and competitor moves. By analyzing and researching their target market, companies can make informed decisions on how to respond to unexpected changes.
However, there are also disadvantages to the deliberate strategy. One disadvantage is that it is time-consuming, expensive, and can stifle innovation. Implementation of deliberate strategies can be costly, with companies investing resources in research and analysis. Additionally, a deliberate strategy can be difficult to change; once adopted, it may be challenging to pivot in response to unexpected market developments. 
In contrast, an emergent strategy is more flexible and responsive to shifts in the industry. It is a bottom-up approach to strategy formulation, where insight is gathered through trial and error and experimentation. An emergent strategy is organic and evolves over time, based on feedback and experiences gained from the market. Companies that use an emergent strategy are less structured and hierarchical, and everyone's input is encouraged. 
Coca-Cola is an example of a company that has benefited from an emergent strategy. In the 1980s, Coca-Cola made a strategic decision to change its recipe to remain competitive in the soft drink market. The change was not well-received, and sales decreased. However, the company listened to feedback from its customers and employees and made a U-turn by bringing back its original recipe. The company resonated with its consumers' emotions and regained its position in the market. 
One advantage of an emergent strategy is that it allows companies to take advantage of unexpected opportunities and quickly adapt to change. An emergent strategy can help companies discover new markets, new products, and new ways of doing things. Additionally, starting an emergent strategy requires less upfront capital and resources, making it a more cost-effective option for startups.
However, there are disadvantages to an emergent strategy. Emergent strategies can lack direction and clarity, and the company may struggle to achieve its objectives without a clear plan. Another disadvantage is that the decision-making process in an emergent strategy can be slow and inefficient, and changes may require a more extensive overhaul of the company's operations. 
In conclusion, both deliberate and emergent strategy approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. The deliberate strategy emphasizes structure, planning, and control. The approach allows companies to set a clear direction, anticipate market changes, and work efficiently towards achieving objectives. In contrast, the emergent strategy is more fluid and flexible and promotes innovation, resilience, and exploration. The approach allows companies to take advantage of unexpected opportunities, adapt quickly to change, and react promptly to feedback. 
In my opinion, a combination of both strategies is the most effective approach. By integrating the deliberative and emergent strategy, companies can observe both top-down and bottom-up methods, resulting in informed decision-making and an agile response to change. Companies should first set a clear direction and goals, then allow their team members to experiment within the limits of the goals. Through constant feedback and evaluation, the emergent strategy can help the company adjust its approach to achieve its objectives. By blending both approaches, companies can experience the advantages of both while minimizing the disadvantages.
