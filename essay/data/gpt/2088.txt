Waterlogging is a process whereby an area of land becomes saturated with water, creating an oxygen-poor environment that slows down the decay of organic materials. This process has contributed significantly to the preservation of archaeological artefacts, particularly in wetland areas such as swamps, bogs, and marshes. By studying these artefacts, scientists and archaeologists have been able to gain a better understanding of the lives and cultures of ancient people around the world.
One of the most significant ways in which waterlogging has contributed to the preservation of archaeological artefacts is by slowing down the decay of organic materials such as wood, leather and bone. Normally, these materials would quickly decompose in the presence of oxygen and bacteria. However, when they are submerged in waterlogged soil, the bacteria are starved of oxygen and cannot break down the organic material as quickly. This creates an environment where ancient organic artefacts can survive for thousands of years.
The study of ancient artefacts is called archaeometry, and it has been developed to precisely date them. Radio carbon dating is one of the most common techniques used to determine the age of these artefacts. This technique works on the assumption that the level of carbon-14 in the environment has remained relatively constant over time, and that organic materials absorb carbon-14 from the environment at a known rate. By measuring the amount of carbon-14 remaining in a sample and comparing it with the carbon-14 levels in the environment today, scientists can determine the age of the artefact.
One example of successful excavations that have utilized waterlogging to preserve ancient artefacts is the Tollund Man. In 1950, a group of peat cutters in Denmark discovered the body of a man preserved in a bog. The body had been so well preserved by the acidic peat and cold water that the face and hair were still clearly visible.  The body was so well preserved that it was initially believed to be a recent murder victim. However, when scientists carried out radiocarbon dating on the Tollund Man, they found that he dated back to the Iron Age. We now know that he was a sacrifice, killed by ritual strangulation and then placed in the bog as an offering to the gods. The Tollund Man remains one of the best-preserved bog bodies in the world and continues to provide valuable insights into ancient cultures.
Another example of successful excavations utilizing waterlogging is the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, Denmark. The museum contains several well-preserved Viking ships that were discovered in the nearby fjord. The wrecks were intentionally sunk in the 11th century, most likely to block the entrance to the fjord and protect against rival raiders. Despite being underwater for over 900 years, the ships were remarkably well-preserved. The waterlogged environment of the fjord had kept the wood from rotting and the lack of oxygen had prevented the growth of wood-eating organisms. The excavation of these Viking ships provided important insights into Viking technology, shipbuilding, and seafaring techniques.
In conclusion, waterlogging has contributed significantly to the preservation of archaeological artefacts, particularly those made of organic materials. The oxygen-poor environment of waterlogged soil has slowed down the decay of these materials, allowing them to be preserved for thousands of years. This has enabled science to gain a better understanding of ancient cultures, their technology, and their way of life. Techniques such as radiocarbon dating have been developed to precisely date the artefacts and provide further insights into the past. The success of excavations such as the Tollund Man and the Viking Ship Museum has demonstrated the importance of waterlogging in the preservation of archaeological artefacts.
