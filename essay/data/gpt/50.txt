Oscar Wilde’s celebrated novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, is a literary masterpiece that remains a fascination to the literary globe. The plot and its underlying themes have stirred debates and discourse in various literary genres, among which is Wilde's exploration of degeneration and its connection with physicality. The novel’s protagonist, Dorian Gray, goes through various transformations that demonstrate Wilde's interest in degeneration. In this essay, we examine Wilde's use of Lombroso's theory of degeneration and physicality to establish character descriptions and portray the demise of Dorian Gray.
Lombroso's theory of degeneration and physicality was a prominent theory in the late nineteenth century. The theory posited that physical characteristics indicated a person's moral and psychological state, which, in turn, guided their behavior. According to the degeneration theory, a person's temperament, and mindset could be determined by their physical features, predominantly cranial size, jaw size, and skin color. Lombroso believed that criminals possessed physical traits that set them apart from non-criminals. Dorian Gray's physical features align with Lombroso's theory of degeneration. For instance, Dorian's elongated neck, the sharp, pointed chin, and delicate hands reflect his otherworldliness and lack of concern for labor since these features indicate an aristocratic nature. Wilde uses Dorian's physical characteristics to establish the groundwork for who Dorian Gray is as a person.
At the start of the novel, Dorian Gray is introduced as a "lad whose face was framed in hair of curling gold" (Wilde, 1890, p. 7). The novel describes Dorian as a beautiful young man with a magnetic personality who attracted those around him. It is evident that Dorian's physical appearance aligns with Lombroso's theory, which suggests he might possess moral weaknesses. Moreover, Dorian's godlike appearance could represent the archetypal image of the Nietzschean ubermensch, which was very popular in late nineteenth-century European culture. The ubermensch represented a person free of social restraints that had the ability to transcend accepted moral boundaries. However, Dorian's appearance is deceptive, for his actions betray his innocent-looking demeanor. The author explores how Dorian's looks gave him the advantage of being judged for his appearance rather than his character. Wilde uses Dorian to explore how the use of physical attributes can be misleading as the characterization of Dorian Gray evolves throughout the story.
Wilde uses Dorian's physical description to set the scene for Dorian's internal struggles. The plot starts with Dorian's arrival in London, a young man on the cusp of adulthood venturing into the world. Dorian's experience with Basil Hallward, the verbal ‘artist’ who introduced him to his patron and helped him gain entry into the high social circles, also contributed to Dorian's degeneration. Wilde reveals Dorian's degeneration through his physical traits as his face becomes more sallow and his eyes more hardened – characterizations that are consistent with Lombroso's theory of degeneration. As Dorian’s corrupt behavior spirals out of control, his physical representation transforms into something more sinister, channeling the traditional Gothic horror trope. Dorian's physical changes are a direct response to his thoughts and actions, which lead him on a downward spiral. Wilde uses Dorian's physical transformation as a symbol of his corrupted mind.
Wilde also explores the connection between physical beauty and corruption. It is apparent throughout the novel that Dorian Gray is not inherently evil; rather, his circumstances brought him to become who he is. Wilde continues to make that clear with Dorian's physical traits, as the picture serves as a visual representation of Dorian's corruption. Dorian Gray wished to remain young and beautiful forever, and the picture hidden away in his attic represented the price he paid to do so. The picture begins as a beautiful work of art, but as Dorian's behavior became more brutal, The Picture became a horrifying depiction of Dorian's degeneracy. Wilde uses The Picture to question whether Dorian's physical beauty and the attention that he receives from society are the root of his moral decay. This is indicated by the realization that the painting embodies the nasty and unruly side of Dorian since his beauty was a mere surface-level guise that conceals the true nature of his personality.
Dorian Gray's corrupt behavior finally leads him to commit murder, and as he realizes the depth of his degeneracy, he becomes panicked and emotional. As Dorian tries to rise out of his despair, he attempts to destroy the painting that served as a visual representation of his corruption. However, as Dorian stabs the portrait, he fatally wounds himself, with the damage to the painting repairing him and finishing off his physical appearance. This scene’s culmination, symbolic of the internal conflict Dorian has fought, illustrates Wilde's use of the physical to represent moral phenomena. Wilde uses this scene to demonstrate how physicality and morality are intimately entangled and cannot be separated. Dorian's external appearance at the end is a physical embodiment of his past sins.
In conclusion, Wilde's exploration of degeneration theory in The Picture of Dorian Gray is central to the novel's plot and characters. Wilde skillfully weaves Lombroso's theory of degeneration and physicality into the novel to represent the moral and physical struggles of Dorian Gray. His descriptions of Dorian Gray's features mirrored the degenerate type defined by Lombroso, and Wilde highlights the flaws in this approach by showcasing how the traits could be used deceptively. Dorian Gray's physical appearance and transformation into a monster, as represented by The Picture, serves as an illustration of the connection between physical appearance, morality, and social acceptability. Through this reading, it becomes clear that Wilde was concerned about the role of physical appearance in the social and moral judgment of an individual. Wilde encourages his readers to consider more profound aspects of human nature while also providing an ominous warning about the dangers of superficial judgments.
