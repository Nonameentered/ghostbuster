The bonus and commission system is a widely used method to incentivize salespeople in various industries. At Holtzbrinck Publishers Holdings Limited, a global publishing company, the sales team is motivated by this system. While it has several strengths, it also has weaknesses that may adversely impact the sales team's performance. In this essay, I will examine the strengths and weaknesses of Holtzbrinck's bonus and commission system and its impact on the number of salespeople receiving bonuses as quarterly targets change.
One of the significant strengths of the bonus and commission system is that it incentivizes salespeople to work harder and achieve their sales targets. At Holtzbrinck, sales teams are provided with targets that they must meet each quarter, and bonuses are awarded to those that meet or exceed their targets. This method ensures that salespeople work diligently all year round to achieve their goals, which translates into higher profits for the company.
Secondly, the system also promotes friendly competition between salespeople. Bonuses and commissions are awarded to those who make more sales, which leads to a healthy level of competition among the sales team. This can lead to an increase in teamwork and collaboration as salespeople work together towards a common goal. Additionally, friendly competition can inspire salespeople to work harder, which in turn can result in more sales and profits for the company.
However, the bonus and commission system is not without its weaknesses. Firstly, it may lead to a focus on short-term results at the expense of long-term business plans. Since salespeople are incentivized to make more sales in a short period, they may neglect to develop long-term customer relationships or focus on product quality. This could harm the company's reputation and bottom line in the long run.
Another weakness of the bonus and commission system is that it may lead to unfair treatment between salespeople. Since bonuses and commissions are awarded solely based on sales performance, some salespeople may receive higher bonuses than others, even if they are equally as hardworking. This could lead to dissatisfaction and demotivation among the sales team.
Regarding the impact of quarterly targets on the number of salespeople who receive bonuses, changes in targets can greatly affect performance. For instance, if the targets are too high, some salespeople may be demotivated from the outset, thinking that they are unachievable, and may not push themselves as hard to meet the targets. Alternatively, if the goals are too low, some salespeople may not feel motivated to work to their full potential because the targets are too easy to attain. A balance must be found to incentivize and motivate salespeople to achieve their targets and exceed them.
Moreover, when targets are changed, it can lead to the exclusion of some salespeople from receiving bonuses. This can cause dissatisfaction among the sales team, which can lead to lower morale and reduced motivation to work hard and achieve targets. Additionally, changing targets frequently can create confusion and unrest, as salespeople may not be sure what they are working towards or if they are eligible for bonuses.
In conclusion, while the bonus and commission system has its strengths, such as motivating salespeople to work harder and promoting healthy competition, it also has weaknesses that must be addressed. The system may encourage short-term thinking, and unfair treatment between salespeople can occur. The Holtzbrinck Publishers Holdings Limited should be cautious when setting quarterly targets to ensure that they are neither too high nor too low and promote an environment of fairness and motivation. Additionally, the company should consider instituting other non-financial incentives to reward salespeople and promote long-term business sustainability in conjunction with the bonus and commission system.
