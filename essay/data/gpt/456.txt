In the United Kingdom, the retention of fingerprints and DNA samples has been the subject of much debate, both legal and ethical. The main questions and cases discussed before the House of Lords in regard to the retention of these samples revolved around the balancing of the right to privacy and the need for effective crime control and detection. These debates reached their climactic point in the early 2000s, and were focused on the legal challenges brought by individuals who sought to have their DNA and fingerprints removed from police databases after they had been acquitted or not charged.
One of the most significant cases that came before the House of Lords was the case of S and Marper v UK. In this case, two individuals, S and Marper, who had been arrested and detained for unrelated offenses, challenged the policy of the police to retain their DNA samples and fingerprints after they were acquitted. They claimed that the retention of their samples was a violation of their right to privacy under articles 8 and 14 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950. In particular, they argued that the retention of their samples interfered with their right to respect for their private life, and that such interference was not proportionate to the benefits derived from retaining their samples. 
Ultimately, the House of Lords found in favor of S and Marper, ruling that the blanket retention of all DNA samples and fingerprints taken from individuals who had been arrested but not convicted was a disproportionate interference with their right to privacy. In particular, the court noted that while the retention of samples had some crime-control benefits, these benefits were outweighed by the harm caused to individuals whose samples were retained without their consent. Baroness Hale of Richmond, one of the judges who ruled in favor of S and Marper, argued that the retention of DNA samples and fingerprints was particularly problematic because the samples were biographical data that revealed intimate details about an individual's genetic makeup and personal characteristics.
However, not all members of the House of Lords agreed with the ruling in the S and Marper case. Lord Steyn, one of the judges who dissented in the case, argued that the retention of DNA samples and fingerprints was necessary for effective crime control and detection. He noted that advances in technology had made it possible to use DNA evidence to solve crimes that would otherwise remain unsolved, and that the retention of samples was a necessary tool in the fight against crime. Furthermore, Lord Steyn argued that the retention of samples did not constitute a violation of an individual's right to privacy, as the samples were taken as part of an investigative process and were not intended to be kept indefinitely.
The debate over the retention of DNA samples and fingerprints was given added impetus by the policy of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire to retain all samples, except in exceptional cases, of acquitted individuals. This policy was challenged in the case of R (on the application of RMC) v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. In this case, an individual challenged the Chief Constable's policy as being in breach of his right to privacy. The individual argued that his DNA samples had been taken without his consent, and that he had an expectation that they would be destroyed once he had been acquitted. The court ultimately agreed with the individual, ruling that the Chief Constable's policy was a disproportionate interference with his right to privacy under article 8 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 1950.
However, the debate over the retention of DNA samples and fingerprints continues to this day. Those who support the retention of these samples argue that they are necessary for effective crime detection and control, and that the benefits of retaining them outweigh the harm caused to individuals whose samples are retained without their consent. They also argue that advances in DNA technology make it possible to identify suspects and solve crimes that would otherwise remain unsolved. On the other hand, opponents of the retention of samples argue that this practice infringes on an individual's right to privacy, and that the retention of biographical data about individuals without their consent is inherently problematic.
In conclusion, the debate over the retention of DNA samples and fingerprints is a complex and controversial issue that has been the subject of much litigation in the United Kingdom. The main questions and cases discussed before the House of Lords in regard to the retention of these samples revolved around the balancing of the right to privacy and the need for effective crime control and detection. While there are valid arguments on both sides of this debate, it is clear that the courts in the UK have tended to err on the side of protecting an individual's right to privacy, particularly in cases where DNA samples or fingerprints have been taken without an individual's consent. Ultimately, the challenge for policymakers in the UK will be to strike a balance between the need for effective crime control and the protection of individual privacy rights in an increasingly complex and uncertain world.
