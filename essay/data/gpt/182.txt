Introduction
Computer simulations have become an essential tool in the study of biological systems. In the area of lipid bilayer modelling, the course-graining technique has revolutionized the way biophysicists model lipid bilayer assemblies. This technique involves the reduction of the number of atoms used to represent a lipid bilayer in the simulation. This simplification allows us to model lipid bilayer assemblies, which are much larger than what is possible with classical molecular dynamics. In this essay, I will explain what the course-graining technique is and how it works in lipid bilayer modelling. I will also describe how this technique improves accuracy and fidelity compared to previous simulations. Finally, I will discuss the different stages of vesicle formation observed in simulations, and how the course-graining model agrees with experiment.
Course Graining technique in lipid bilayer modelling
The course-graining technique involves the simplification of the number of atoms used to represent a lipid bilayer in a simulation. This technique was first introduced to study the equilibrium properties of lipid bilayers by Scott Feller and coworkers in 2002, and has since been applied to many other systems.
In the course-graining technique, a single lipid molecule is no longer represented by hundreds of atoms, but by only a few. The remaining atoms are replaced by a "course-grained" representation, which is typically represented by beads. This simplification is achieved by grouping atoms close together into “beads” that represent larger portions of the molecule.
The interaction energies between the beads in the course-grained lipid bilayer are derived from atomistic simulations. The interaction energies between the beads typically consist of van der Waals, electrostatic, and bonding energies. The force field for coarse-grained simulations is typically parameterized to reproduce experimental observables, such as the area per lipid and the lateral pressure profile of the bilayer.
The course-grained model can be used to simulate large systems, such as lipid bilayer assemblies, that would otherwise be impossible to study using classical molecular dynamics. For example, when simulating large systems, the computational cost of atomistic simulations would be prohibitively high, but with the course-grained simulation, it is possible to simulate systems containing millions of lipids to explore previously inaccessible timescales.
Improvement of accuracy and fidelity compared to previous simulations
The course-grained model reduces the number of atoms the simulation requires. These models are highly specialized to lipid molecules and lipid bilayers, which allows us to study these systems more comprehensively. The ability to simulate large systems for longer timescales is the most significant advantage of the course-grained simulation, as researchers can investigate observable phenomena that classical molecular dynamics investigations could not. Coarse-grained models are hampered in the accuracy and fidelity of results compared to atomistic simulations. However, this tradeoff between accuracy and simulation size are well known, so a simulation’s researchers can plan accordingly to get the most out of their choice of technique.
Some of the advantages of the course-grained model, compared to previous simulations using atomistic representations of large systems, are that the course-grained models are computationally simpler: they require less memory and computational time. More importantly, the computational necessities of course-grained models enable researchers to study, and reproduce the bilayer's different properties, including we simulate the energy profile across the bilayer. In practice, it is challenging to obtain such critical properties from atomistic simulations, and the researchers have to make their assumptions which lead to the possibility of generating inaccurate data. The course-grained model provides, with negligible cost, better accuracy, including increasing computational speed, providing higher resolution and reducing artifacts created in the simulations by the replicas.
Different stages of vesicle formation observed in simulations
The course-graining technique has enabled the exploration of the different stages of vesicle formation in lipid bilayers. Vesicles are spherical lipid bilayer assemblies that are formed by the self-assembly of lipids in water. During vesicle formation, the lipids self-assemble to form a spherical structure that encloses a small volume of water.
Morrissey et al. (2019) performed simulations of vesicle formation and observed four distinct stages of vesicle formation: lipid self-assembly, hemifusion, fusion pore formation, and vesicle release. During the lipid self-assembly phase, the lipids rearrange their orientation to form a bilayer that is curved into a spherical shape. Once the lipid bilayer is curved into a spherical shape, the lipids at the edge of the bilayer start to fuse, leading to hemifusion. During this phase, the lipid chains interdigitate, and polar head groups intermix. When the lipids begin to form a fusion pore, the polar head groups mix through the opening. Finally, vesicle release occurs when the fusion pore opens, and the vesicle separates from the parent bilayer.
The course-grained model agrees with experiment
The course-graining technique has been validated experimentally. It has been shown to reproduce the experimental data for various lipid bilayer properties, such as area/lipid, density profiles, energetics, and lateral diffusion coefficients.
During the lipid self-assembly stage, low-order properties like the area per molecule are coordinated to form bilayers; the course-grained model has been shown to deliver values that agree with experiments. Also, the liquid-ordered phase results in a decrease in the diffusion coefficient of lipid molecules in the bilayer's plane. Studies have shown that the course-grained model reduces the lipid diffusion coefficient, which is a hallmark of the liquid-ordered phase, consistent with experimental data. The force field used to parameterize the interaction energies between the beads in the course-grained lipid bilayer are derived from atomistic simulations, which accurately captures the experimental data, providing an assurance of the reliability of course-grained models.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the course-graining technique is a robust modelling approach that revolutionizes the modelling and simulation of bilayer assemblies. The technique reduces the number of atoms required in simulation, making it possible to simulate larger systems, for longer timescales. The technique has improved accuracy and fidelity compared to previous simulations while reproducing various experimental data from bilayer properties such as density profiles, density fluctuations, and energetics. The course-graining technique allows us to explore the different stages of vesicle formation, which has broad implications for the study of cell biology. The course-graining technique enables biophysicists to perform simulations at much larger scales than with molecular dynamics, hence enhancing our understanding of biological systems and aiding potential therapeutic interventions.
