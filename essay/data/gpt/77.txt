Gerrard Winstanley, an English Protestant religious and political activist born in the seventeenth century, developed a highly complex religious outlook that influenced his activism, millenarianism, conception of God, understanding of the Fall and Restoration, and views on the institutionalized church. Some scholars and critics regard Winstanley as a visionary mystic and social revolutionary, while others condemn him as a radical fanatic and heretic. This essay argues that, to understand the complexity of Winstanley’s religious outlook, one must appreciate his historical context, intellectual background, and spiritual experiences. Furthermore, this essay will examine various debates surrounding Winstanley’s millenarianism, conception of God, understanding of the Fall and Restoration, and views on the institutionalized church, arguing that Winstanley’s ideas emerged from his profound spiritual experiences and biblical interpretation.
Winstanley lived during a tumultuous period of English history, characterized by religious, political, and social conflicts. In the mid-seventeenth century, England experienced a civil war between the royalist and parliamentary forces, a regicide that resulted in the execution of King Charles I, and a period of republican government under Oliver Cromwell. During this period, various religious groups emerged, including Anglicans, Puritans, Baptists, Quakers, and radicals such as the Levellers, Diggers, and Ranters. Winstanley’s activism and religious outlook were shaped by this environment of political and religious upheaval.
Winstanley was born in Wigan, Lancashire, in 1609 and grew up in a modest family of clothiers. He received a basic education and became a tailor by trade. However, Winstanley’s intellectual curiosity led him to explore various religious and philosophical ideas, such as Calvinism, Arminianism, Platonism, and Hermeticism. In the 1640s, Winstanley became a member of the Puritan sect known as the True Levellers, or Diggers, which sought to establish communal communities on common land, challenging the existing social order and property rights. Winstanley’s millenarianism, conception of God, and views on the institutionalized church emerged from his experiences as a Digger and his biblical interpretation.
One of the debates surrounding Winstanley’s millenarianism is his belief in the imminent arrival of the fifth monarchy, a period of rule by the saints based on the Book of Daniel. Winstanley argued that the earthly kingdoms of Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome had already fallen, and the fifth monarchy, representing Christ’s reign on earth, was about to begin. However, some scholars have criticized Winstanley’s millenarianism as irrational, unrealistic, and potentially dangerous. They argue that Winstanley’s emphasis on the imminent end-times could lead to apathy, fatalism, or fanaticism, and that his utopian vision of a perfect society was impossible to achieve.
On the other hand, defenders of Winstanley’s millenarianism argue that he saw the fifth monarchy not as a literal kingdom ruled by a human king, but as a metaphorical reign of justice, love, and peace, based on the principles of equality and mutual aid. They argue that Winstanley’s millenarianism was not a rejection of the material world or a withdrawal from political action, but a call for radical social transformation and spiritual renewal. Moreover, they argue that Winstanley’s millenarianism was rooted in his biblical interpretation and spiritual experiences, which he saw as a direct encounter with God’s truth and love.
Winstanley’s conception of God was also a highly debated topic. Winstanley rejected the traditional view of God as an omnipotent, transcendent, and punishing deity and instead emphasized God’s immanence, love, and compassion. He argued that God was not a distant judge or ruler, but a present and active force within the human soul and the natural world. Moreover, Winstanley rejected the idea of predestination, arguing that humans had free will and could choose to follow God’s will or not. This view challenged the prevailing Calvinist doctrine of election, which emphasized God’s sovereignty and preordination of human salvation or damnation.
Critics of Winstanley’s conception of God argue that it undermined the authority and transcendence of God and reduced God to a mere human emotion or psychological projection. They argue that Winstanley’s God was too subjective, too individualistic, and too sentimental, and that his rejection of predestination weakened the moral and theological coherence of his religious outlook. Moreover, they argue that Winstanley’s God was too accommodating to human desires and too permissive of sinful behavior.
Defenders of Winstanley’s conception of God argue that it was based on his spiritual experiences and intimate relationship with God, which he saw as a personal encounter with the divine presence. They argue that Winstanley’s God was not an abstract concept or theological construct, but a living reality that could be experienced and known. Moreover, they argue that Winstanley’s rejection of predestination was consistent with his belief in free will and human responsibility for moral choices and actions.
Winstanley’s understanding of the Fall and Restoration was another debated topic. Winstanley rejected the orthodox interpretation of the Fall as a historical event that resulted in the original sin and the corruption of human nature. Instead, he saw the Fall as a metaphorical and spiritual condition of separation from God’s love and truth, which could be overcome through spiritual regeneration and the restoration of the divine image within humans. Winstanley argued that the Restoration was not a return to the pre-fall paradise, but a transformation of human consciousness and society based on the principles of justice, love, and peace.
Critics of Winstanley’s understanding argue that it devalued the importance of biblical history and undermined the doctrine of redemption. They argue that Winstanley’s rejection of the historical fall and original sin weakened the theological foundation of Christ’s atonement and the need for salvation. Moreover, they argue that Winstanley’s Restoration was too vague and unrealistic, and that his utopian vision relied on an unattainable spiritual perfectionism.
Defenders of Winstanley’s understanding argue that it was consistent with his holistic and organic view of nature and humanity, which rejected dualistic and mechanistic concepts of reality. They argue that Winstanley’s understanding emphasized the possibility of human transformation and social renewal, based on the divine image within humans and the power of spiritual regeneration. Moreover, they argue that Winstanley’s Restoration was not a utopian fantasy but a concrete and practical vision of social justice and equality grounded in the principles of mutual aid and common ownership.
Finally, Winstanley’s views on the institutionalized church were also debated. Winstanley rejected the hierarchical, institutionalized, and exclusive nature of the Anglican Church and instead emphasized the universal, spiritual, and egalitarian nature of true Christianity. He argued that the visible church, with its formal rituals, dogmas, and structures, had corrupted the authentic message of Christ and created social divisions and injustices. Moreover, Winstanley rejected the clergy’s authority and emphasized the universal priesthood of all believers, who should have direct access to God’s truth and grace.
Critics of Winstanley’s views on the church argue that they undermined the authority and stability of the church and promoted sectarianism and anarchy. They argue that Winstanley’s rejection of the visible church weakened the theological and moral coherence of his religious outlook and ignored the historical and institutional context of Christianity. Moreover, they argue that Winstanley’s views on the universal priesthood of all believers ignored the function of the clergy as spiritual leaders, teachers, and guides.
Defenders of Winstanley’s views on the church argue that they were consistent with his commitment to spiritual freedom, social justice, and human equality. They argue that Winstanley’s rejection of the visible church was not a rejection of Christianity but a rejection of the institutionalized and exclusive nature of the church. Moreover, they argue that Winstanley’s views on the universal priesthood of all believers emphasized the spiritual dignity and autonomy of every human being and challenged the hierarchical and authoritarian structures of society.
In conclusion, Gerrard Winstanley’s religious outlook was highly complex and influenced by various factors, including his historical context, intellectual background, and spiritual experiences. To understand the complexity of his ideas, one must appreciate the debates surrounding his millenarianism, conception of God, understanding of the Fall and Restoration, and views on the institutionalized church. Although Winstanley’s ideas were controversial and challenged the orthodox doctrines and institutions of his time, they were rooted in his profound spiritual experiences and biblical interpretation and reflected his commitment to social justice, human dignity, and spiritual renewal. Winstanley’s legacy continues to inspire and challenge religious and political activists today.
