The development of transportation has been fundamental for bringing progress and economic prosperity to different countries. The transportation narrative of progress is commonly associated with the railroad, which transformed the economy, expanded commerce and created new opportunities for trade. The railroad has been portrayed as the catalyst for modern industrialization and one of the most powerful forces of change in society. However, this narrative also has its detractors, who point out the environmental and social costs of building railroads on the land, as well as the displacement of people and cultures. The purpose of this essay is to explore the similarities and differences between the railroad narrative of progress and the axe and mill narratives, and to analyze how the railroad's significant influence on the economic and political climate made it fundamentally distinct from its predecessors.
The railroad, the axe, and the mill have been powerful symbols of American progress and expansion. In the late 1800s, the railroad was seen as a necessity for connecting goods and people to markets and opportunities. The axe and the mill were seen as powerful tools for extracting resources from the natural environment, such as timber, minerals, and coal. These tools enabled settlers to clear land for crops, build homes, create new industries, and generate wealth. Both narratives often framed progress in terms of the industrialization of the economy, the creation of jobs, and the expansion of markets and commerce.
One similarity between the railroad narrative of progress and the axe and mill narratives is their emphasis on the role of technology in transforming the economic landscape. The railroad was often seen as the epitome of technological innovation, as it allowed for faster, cheaper transportation of goods and people across great distances. Similarly, the axe and mill were seen as technological innovations that allowed settlers to extract resources from the land with greater efficiency and speed. These technologies were seen as essential for improving the quality of life for Americans and expanding the country's economic potential.
Another similarity is that both narratives tend to overlook the environmental and social costs of progress. The axe and mill narratives often romanticize the pioneer lifestyle and the triumph of man over nature. This narrative ignores the fact that logging, mining and other extractive industries not only destroy habitats but also displace or eliminate indigenous cultures. Similarly, the railroad narrative of progress tends to downplay the environmental and social impact of building and operating railroads in the West. Native American communities and their way of life were particularly exploited by railroad companies. These communities were forced to either move or adapt to new environments after being displaced from their native lands, which were often destroyed by the construction of railroads. Both narratives often gloss over the fact that Native American tribes and other marginalized groups were subjected to exploitation and dispossession in the pursuit of progress.
Despite these similarities, the railroad narrative of progress is fundamentally distinct from the axe and mill narratives, because it had a much greater impact on the economic and political landscape of the United States. The railroad transformed America's economy by connecting markets and expanding commerce. It enabled goods to be produced in one part of the country and consumed in another, allowing for an unprecedented amount of trade and commerce. This led to specialization, the growth of cities, and the rise of new industries/businesses that could take advantage of the new transportation network. It created new opportunities for people to move around and find work, as well as migrate to new areas and build new communities.
The railroad also had a significant impact on the political landscape, as it became a major source of investment and capital. The railroad industry attracted the attention of wealthy capitalists who saw the potential for significant financial gain from investing in the industry. As a result, the railroad industry became one of the most powerful and influential lobbies in American politics. Railroad companies in the late 1800s were full of political insiders, such as Mark Twain, who held sway over policymakers and were able to influence the way that laws and regulations were written. This meant that the railroad narrative of progress was not just a story of technological prowess but also a story of political influence.
In conclusion, the similarities and differences between the railroad narrative of progress and the axe and mill narratives reveal how different technologies can shape the way that progress is perceived and measured. The railroad narrative of progress had a much greater impact on the economic and political climate of the United States than the axes and mills were ever able to. This narrative transformed the economy, expanded commerce, created new opportunities and enabled people to move around more easily and find work. At the same time, this narrative of progress had significant social and environmental costs, including the displacement of communities and cultures, damage to fragile ecosystems, and the destruction of natural habitats. It is important to be aware of these costs in order to better understand the complexities of American history and to appreciate the value of progress for creating a better future for all.
