The appropriate methodology for gaining the greatest amount of data will also be discussed while exploring the advantages and disadvantages of using observations and interviews. Finally, the essay will analyze how a phenomenological approach and semi-structured interviews will be used to explore the meaning of individual lived experiences and gain more in-depth results. 
Nurses' Opinions on Current Infection Control Policies and Guidelines Regarding Hand Washing in Hospitals
In hospitals, hand hygiene is a critical component of infection control. Over the years, there have been different policies and guidelines implemented to promote adherence to hand washing practices. However, studies have shown that not all healthcare professionals comply with these guidelines. According to a study conducted by Allegranzi et al. (2009), hand hygiene compliance rates among healthcare professionals were found to be less than 50%. This statistic indicates that adherence to hand hygiene policies is a significant issue in healthcare institutions. 
Nurses in healthcare institutions are expected to use the proper techniques when performing hand hygiene to reduce the risk of infection transmission (Temte et al., 2017). However, some nurses' opinions on the current guidelines are not favorable. According to a study conducted by Costa et al. (2015), nurses reported that the current guidelines were not suitable for their work environment. The nurses argued that the guidelines were too time-consuming, cumbersome, and unrealistic. They also reported that adherence to the guidelines was difficult since it did not match with their daily routine. Such opinions could lead to non-adherence to the hand hygiene policies and guidelines. 
Why Some Professionals Follow the Guidelines while Others Do Not
Different factors influence healthcare professionals' adherence to hand hygiene policies and guidelines. Some healthcare professionals have reported that understaffing, heavy workload, and lack of time are the main barriers to adherence. Understaffing means that there are not enough staff available to carry out crucial tasks such as hand hygiene. The heavy workload means that healthcare professionals may not have sufficient time to complete their tasks and practice adequate hand hygiene. Such factors could lead to non-adherence to the hand hygiene policies and guidelines. 
On the other hand, some healthcare professionals comply with the hand hygiene policies and guidelines despite the challenges. Compliance to hand hygiene practices could be linked to the level of knowledge and training received. Healthcare professionals who have a good understanding of the infection control policies and guidelines are more likely to comply. A study conducted by Lundberg et al. (2015) found that healthcare professionals' knowledge levels were positively correlated with hand hygiene compliance. The study concluded that education and training programs could be used to promote compliance with hand hygiene policies and guidelines. 
How Compliance Levels can be Improved at Kingston Hospital
To improve compliance levels at Kingston Hospital, different strategies could be employed. One strategy is to conduct regular education and training programs for healthcare professionals. The training should focus on the importance of hand hygiene in reducing infection transmission, proper techniques of hand hygiene, and the necessary steps to prevent non-adherence. Continuous monitoring and feedback following the education and training could also be effective in promoting compliance with the hand hygiene guidelines. 
Another strategy is to provide adequate resources such as functional sinks, appropriate hand washing solutions, and alcohol-based hand sanitizers in all patient-care areas. This strategy ensures that healthcare professionals have the necessary resources to practice hand hygiene effectively. The hospital could also adopt a culture that prioritizes hand hygiene practices. This culture could be promoted through posters, reminders, and continuous reinforcement of the importance of hand hygiene. 
The Appropriate Methodology for Gaining the Greatest Amount of Data, and the Advantages and Disadvantages of Using Observations and Interviews
Observation and interviews are commonly used in research to gain data about healthcare professionals' adherence to guidelines and policies. Observation involves the systematic measurement and recording of observed behavior. In contrast, interviews involve the researcher asking questions to participants to gain insights into their experiences and perceptions of a particular issue. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of method depends on the study's research question and objectives. 
Observations allow researchers to record healthcare professionals' actual behaviors when performing hand hygiene. This method allows researchers to obtain accurate data and identify situations when healthcare professionals neglect hand hygiene practices. Observations can also capture contextual factors that affect compliance, such as understaffing, crowded patient-care areas, and busy workflow. However, observations are time-consuming, and researchers may miss some behavior or fail to recognize specific contextual factors that influence compliance. 
Interviews allow researchers to gain insight into healthcare professionals' understanding of policies and guidelines. Interviews can explore the reasons why some healthcare professionals comply with hand hygiene policies and guidelines while others do not. Interviews are flexible, and participants can provide detailed answers to questions, uncovering insights that are not captured through observation. Interviews, however, may be influenced by the participants' willingness to share their experiences and the difficulty in obtaining detailed information on the subject. 
How a Phenomenological Approach and Semi-Structured Interviews Will be Used to Explore the Meaning of Individual Lived Experiences and Gain More In-Depth Results
Phenomenological research seeks to explore human experiences and perception of a particular issue. This approach is suitable for studying healthcare professionals' lived experiences of hand hygiene policies and guidelines, including any challenges they face in practice. In this study, semi-structured interviews will be used to explore nurses' experiences and perceptions of hand hygiene policies and guidelines. Semi-structured interviews allow the researcher to ask a set of open-ended questions and follow-up questions to gain further insights. The questions used will explore nurses' experiences of the policies and guidelines, the barriers to compliance, and how compliance can be enhanced. 
Semi-structured interviews will be appropriate since they allow participants to provide detailed and rich insights into their experiences of the hand hygiene policies and guidelines. The interviews will allow the researcher to understand the underlying reasons why nurses fail to comply with the guidelines despite understanding their importance. The interviews will also explore which aspects of the guidelines are challenging to follow and identify areas for improvement. Data collected from semi-structured interviews will provide more in-depth results on nurses' experiences and perceptions of hand hygiene policies and guidelines.
The Most Appropriate Sampling Method for Selecting a Representative Sample Size of Ten Nurses at Kingston Hospital
To obtain a representative sample size of nurses at Kingston Hospital, a purposive sampling method will be used. Purposive sampling is a non-random sampling technique that involves selecting participants based on their knowledge, experiences, and characteristics related to the research question. In this study, nurses who have worked for more than a year in patient-care areas at Kingston Hospital will be selected. Nurses who have received previous training on hand hygiene policies and guidelines will also be included. 
A purposive sampling technique is suitable since it allows for the selection of participants who have a good understanding of the research question and who may have experienced the challenges of adhering to hand hygiene policies and guidelines. The purposive sampling method will also enable the selection of participants from different patient-care areas, ensuring that a range of experiences are captured. 
Conclusion
Hand hygiene is an essential aspect of infection control in healthcare institutions. Adherence to hand hygiene policies and guidelines is vital in reducing the risk of infection transmission. However, some healthcare professionals fail to comply with the guidelines, which could lead to the spread of infections. To improve compliance levels, strategies such as education and training programs, provision of adequate resources, and the promotion of a culture that prioritizes hand hygiene practices could be employed.
