In any organization, the quality of service delivery is vital to its success. The service quality of staff and family accommodation services provided by an organization is crucial because it directly impacts the satisfaction of staff and their families. To evaluate the service quality of staff and family accommodation service, the SERVQUAL tool can be used. The tool is a widely accepted instrument for measuring service quality gaps, and it measures customer satisfaction levels by assessing their expectations and perceptions of service quality.
This essay aims to assess the service quality of staff and family accommodation service using the SERVQUAL tool. The evaluation study aims to identify the gaps between customer expectations and the actual delivery of service quality, to improve service delivery, and enhance customer satisfaction.
The SERVQUAL model has five dimensions: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. The tangibles dimension represents the physical evidence of the service provided, such as the appearance of the facilities, equipment, and staff. The reliability dimension measures the ability to provide services accurately and dependably, and the responsiveness dimension measures the speed and willingness to help customers. The assurance dimension determines the competence and credibility of staff and the quality of their communication with customers. Lastly, the empathy dimension measures the ability to understand customers' needs and feelings and to provide personalized care.
The evaluation study of staff and family accommodation service was conducted by analyzing the expectations and perceptions of service quality of customers. A questionnaire was distributed to staff and their families who had used the accommodation services provided by the organization. The questionnaire consisted of questions related to the five dimensions of the SERVQUAL tool.
The results of the evaluation study indicated that there was a gap between customer expectations and perceptions of the service quality provided. The overall score of the service quality was lower than the customer's expectation score. The tangibles dimension showed a significant gap, indicating that customers expected better physical facilities and equipment. The reliability dimension had the lowest gap, indicating that customers perceived the service to be dependable and accurate. The responsiveness dimension showed a moderate gap, indicating that customers expected better service speed and willingness to help. The assurance dimension had a moderate gap, indicating that customers expected better communication with staff and their competence. Finally, the empathy dimension had a moderate gap, indicating that customers expected more personalized care and staff to understand their needs and feelings.
