The advent of computer-mediated communication (CMC) technologies presents a host of possibilities for human social interaction and relationships. People connect across vast distances, form groups based on shared interests, and even do business online. However, the authenticity of these communities remains a subject of debate. Skeptics argue that the seeming detachment from face-to-face interactions diminishes the sense of belonging, while optimists suggest that CMC technologies have the potential to forge community values across disparate locations. Consequently, it is challenging to establish whether authentic communities exist in cyberspace, or if the concept of virtual community is just a myth. This paper critically reviews the various views of scholars on CMC technologies' ability to create virtual connections that mimic authentic communities. The discussion involves the elusive nature of the concept of community, the criteria used to define it, and the social shifts that impact how people relate to each other.
The concept of community is a notoriously elusive one. According to Etzioni (1993), a community is a group of individuals who share common values and have a sense of obligation towards each other. However, the term does not have any universal definition because it varies depending on individual experiences, cultural context, and social norms. Therefore, the definition of virtual community requires an understanding of the concept of community's multidimensional nature. For several years, scholars have attempted to define the innovative concept of virtual community. Rheingold (1993) initially elaborated on the creation of such communities, referring to them as communities of electronically connected individuals who share information and support each other, thus promoting the sense of social capital and group solidarity. Though Rheingold's community definition focused on information-sharing, he acknowledged that technology provides a medium for diverse individuals to expand their sense of belonging, uphold traditional group norms, and establish innovative norms.
However, other scholars have viewed virtual communities with skepticism. They argue that despite virtual communities enabling individuals from far-flung regions to come together and organize, they lack the authenticity of traditional communities. Turkle (2011) states that "the ability to communicate across distances is one of the most important and transformative technological achievements of the twentieth century"('Alone Together,' p.17). Although this is an important feature of new media, Turkle contends that the lack of nonverbal feedback and face-to-face communication diminishes the level of connection among individuals. Consequently, many members of virtual communities remain anonymous, which Dimitrova & Chen (2003) argue, diminishes commitment to the community. Ultimately, skeptics believe that virtual communities are abstract concepts that lack the authenticity that traditional communities have.
It is challenging to define authenticity in a virtual community since the criteria used to determine the concept's authenticity are multifaceted. For instance, McMillan and Chavis (1986) define community as an attribute that comprises the degree of mutuality, attachment, and a shared sense of belonging among individuals. Similarly, others recognize the importance of creating a sense of belonging, shared experiences, and group interactions in a community setting to determine authenticity. Therefore, for virtual communities to be authentic, they should provide opportunities related to direction, support, and connectedness among members. As such, authentic virtual communities require a shared sense of responsibility, interpersonal communication, and embeddedness within the social norms of the group. Conversely, if these characteristics are absent, virtual communities would remain a myth, not an actuality.
Furthermore, social shifts impact how people relate to one another. People have become more accustomed to communicating via social media and computer-based technologies in recent years. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the rate at which individuals turned to virtual communities for interaction and support, highlighting the importance of computer-mediated communication in fostering human connections. As a result, virtual communities have become more acceptable as people seek to establish connections while abiding by social distancing guidelines, thereby creating a new pattern of how people interact and foster connection. However, these interactions depend on the individual's social connections rather than the credibility of the community.
In conclusion, the establishment of authentic communities using CMC technologies is still subject to skepticism. The creation of virtual communities presents a host of possibilities for human interaction. Those inclined to the optimistic view argue that computer-mediated communication technologies like social media platforms present the opportunity to connect across vast distances and form groups based on shared interests. On the other hand, skeptics suggest that the detachment from face-to-face interactions diminishes the sense of belonging. Thus, it is essential to define the concept of community accurately and consider the impact of technology on social interactions to evaluate the authenticity of virtual communities. Additionally, social shifts are critical in shaping how individuals relate to one another and confer group membership to communities, virtual or in-person. Ultimately, authentic virtual communities require a sense of belonging, shared experiences, and interpersonal interaction. Therefore, virtual communities can be authentic if they fulfill the criteria of belonging, embeddedness within social norms, and shared values, as these are paramount in determining the authenticity of a community.
