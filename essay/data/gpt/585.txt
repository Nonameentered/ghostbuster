Introduction

The company has been producing a wide variety of containers for over 50 years with a focus on plastic containers.

The company's outdated systems and procedures have resulted in a lack of coordination and communication, leading to low customer satisfaction rates and increased employee turnover. This essay aims to explore the primary issues with implementing change at C.C.C. regarding its structure, leadership, teams, and power. It will also analyze how C.C.C.'s change strategy falls short of the "eight steps to transforming an organization" outlined by Kotter. Finally, the essay will apply Belbin's analysis of organizational personality and culture to the problems faced by C.C.C.
Issues with Implementing Change at Cox's Container Company
Cox's Container Company faces several issues that make it difficult to implement change. One of the primary issues is the company's organizational structure. The company's structure is hierarchical, with a top-down approach to decision-making. This structure creates silos and impedes effective communication and coordination. The employees feel isolated, and communication across departments is not free and open. This lack of communication and coordination affects the company's ability to respond to customer needs and market trends. 
Another issue with implementing change at C.C.C. is its leadership structure. The company hasn't invested in leadership development, leading to a lack of direction and vision. The leaders in the company lack the skills and knowledge required to lead a transformation process. This situation causes a lack of alignment and direction in the process, leading to mixed messages and barriers to change. 
C.C.C. also has a problem with the effectiveness of its team structures. The company relies heavily on functional teams, each with a narrow focus, leading to fragmentation and duplication of effort. With the company's siloed structure, the teams struggle to work collaboratively, resulting in low performance, fear of sharing knowledge, and a lack of trust. 
The company's power structure is another challenge that makes it hard to implement change. The company's legacy culture has led to a lack of collaboration and openness. The resulting power struggles between different departments and levels in the company's hierarchy stifle innovation, leading to slow decision-making and risk aversion.
Change Strategies and Kotter's Eight Steps for Transforming an Organization
C.C.C.'s leadership employs a top-down approach to implement change, ignoring the importance of employee involvement and participation. The company lacks a sense of urgency, which is the first step in Kotter's model for transforming an organization. The leaders in C.C.C. undervalue the need for change, making it difficult to motivate employees to become part of the process. 
The company also lacks a guiding coalition to drive the change process effectively. The top-down approach to decision-making creates silos, and the teams focus mainly on their functions, ignoring the cross-functional relationships that foster collaboration and innovation. As a result, the teams lack the momentum to drive the change process.
Involvement and participation of employees in the change process is critical for success. Unfortunately, C.C.C. has not taken this aspect of the change process into account. The company has not communicated effectively with employees, which has resulted in resistance and mistrust of the change process. When people don't understand what is happening, they naturally resist and hold back. Resistance increases uncertainty and resistance, leading to negative outcomes.
The company's communication strategy is not effective, with leaders failing to communicate change vision and direction. The lack of a clear communication strategy results in mixed messages and unclear expectations. When messages are not clear, employees naturally resist and fail to engage in the change process. As a result, the change process becomes challenging and takes longer to implement.
Belbin's Analysis of Organizational Personality and Culture and its Application to Cox's Container Company
Belbin's personality and culture theory of work teams suggest that every organizational team has nine personalities that affect its success and performance. The company's personality structures affect how individuals work together and how they feel about each other. At Cox's Container Company, the lack of collaboration is a result of a personality problem that leads to fragmentation and negative emotions between teams. 
C.C.C. has a culture of fear, mistrust, and resistance that engulfs the working environment. The company's culture hinders effective communication, decision-making, and teamwork since everyone is skeptical of each other. The lack of trust leads to a lack of collaboration and open communication between different teams. 
Conclusion
C.C.C. faces several challenges that make it difficult to implement change. These challenges stem from the company's organizational structure, leadership, teams, and power structure. To transform Cox's Container Company, the company needs to adopt a new leadership style that values employee participation and fosters collaboration and communication across departments. The change process should follow the "eight steps to transforming an organization" outlined by Kotter to ensure effective implementation and keen employee involvement. Finally, the company's culture needs to shift towards a culture of trust, transparency, and collaboration if it wants to survive in the current competitive business world.
