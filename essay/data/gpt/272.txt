The world we live in is regulated by the law, which ensures that society is safe and protected from harm. The law determines what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior and stipulates appropriate penalties for any transgressions. Criminal law is a branch of the law that governs criminal offenses and deals with the prosecution and punishment of offenders.
In the scenario presented in this essay, Felicity and Amy have engaged in some behavior that could potentially lead to criminal charges. This essay will identify and explain the potential criminal offenses that Felicity and Amy could be charged with based on the incidents described in the essay and assess whether or not they could be made criminally liable for them. The essay will also consider the scope of applicable criminal law and the principle of fair labelling in determining their liability.
The first incident that requires consideration is when Felicity and Amy, both employees of a department store, stole jewelry worth $20,000 from the store. This behavior constitutes theft, which is a criminal offense under the criminal law. Theft is defined as the taking of someone else's property without their consent and with the intention of depriving them of that property permanently. Felicity and Amy's actions meet this definition, and therefore, they could be charged with theft.
Theft is a serious criminal offense and carries significant penalties under the law. In most jurisdictions, including the United States, theft is classified as a felony offense, which is punishable by imprisonment of more than one year. Felicity and Amy could face imprisonment for their actions.
Additionally, Felicity and Amy could also be charged with conspiracy to commit theft. Conspiracy occurs when two or more people agree to commit an illegal act, and take steps to execute the plan. In this case, Felicity and Amy worked together to commit the theft, and thus, they could be charged with conspiracy, which is also considered a criminal offense.
Felicity and Amy could also face charges of embezzlement. Embezzlement is a criminal offense that occurs when someone who is entrusted with property steals or misappropriates the property for their own personal gain. In this scenario, Felicity and Amy, as employees of the department store, were entrusted with the jewelry, but they stole it for their personal gain. Hence, they could be charged with embezzlement, which is also punishable by imprisonment.
The second incident that requires consideration is when Felicity and Amy, while driving under the influence of alcohol, crashed into a parked car causing severe damage. This behavior constitutes a criminal offense under the criminal law. Driving under the influence of alcohol is a serious offense that endangers the lives of others. It is a criminal offense because it violates the law that prohibits individuals from driving when they are under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
The offence of driving under the influence of alcohol is punishable by a fine and imprisonment depending on the severity of the offense. In this case, Felicity and Amy caused severe damages to a parked car, and thus, they could face a penalty of a fine and imprisonment.
Felicity and Amy could also face charges of vehicular manslaughter if their actions caused the death of another person. Vehicular manslaughter is a criminal offense that is committed when an individual recklessly causes the death of another person while operating a vehicle. In this scenario, Felicity and Amy were driving under the influence, which demonstrated recklessness, and thus, if their actions led to the death of another person, they could face charges of vehicular manslaughter.
The scope of criminal law applies to all individuals within a society. Individuals are required to act in accordance with the law and it is their responsibility to recognize their actions that may be considered as a criminal offense. In the scenario provided, Felicity and Amy have intentionally and recklessly taken part in actions that have constituted criminal offenses. They have violated the law and as such, are liable to be prosecuted in a court of law.
The principle of fair labelling requires that individuals are aware of the offenses they are committing and the penalty they may face for such offenses. This awareness is crucial in ensuring that individuals consciously and voluntarily commit offenses. It is also meant to guide individuals in acting in accordance with the law.
In the scenario provided, Felicity and Amy were aware that they were committing criminal offenses. They stole jewelry worth $20,000, drove under the influence of alcohol, and caused severe damage to a parked car. They had prior knowledge of the penalties attached to such behavior. As such, they are criminally liable for their actions.
In conclusion, Felicity and Amy could be charged with different criminal offenses based on the incidents described in this essay. Theft, conspiracy to commit theft, embezzlement, driving under the influence of alcohol, vehicular manslaughter, and others are potential criminal offenses that they could be charged with. Felicity and Amy are liable for their actions under the scope of applicable criminal law and the principle of fair labelling. It is imperative that individuals understand the consequences of their actions and act in accordance with the law to ensure a safe and secure society.
