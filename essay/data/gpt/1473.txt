The theme of love has been a long-standing topic in literature, and poets have been exploring it in many different ways. Nevertheless, two poets who stand out for their distinct portrayals of love and the importance of identity are Linda France and John Agard. France's poem, "The Surface" and Agard's poem, "Listen Mr Oxford Don" both explore the idea of love while emphasizing on the importance of self-expression. The use of language and form in both of these poems diversely examines the portrayal of love and the importance each poet places on staying authentic in a relationship. By comparing and contrasting both pieces, it becomes evident how they showcase the divergence between idealism and actuality in love while championing individual expression.
In France's poem, "The Surface," the language is atmospheric, figurative, and sensual, providing an ideal representation of love. She employs rich, delicate language, describing the rain as a "murmur" and images such as "sunshine like an apple's rueful blush." These sensuous images intensify the dreamy, mystical quality of love that she presents. Moreover, the language utilized in "The Surface" cushions the mood of the poem, allowing the reader to grasp the idealized theme of love in a soothing manner. Consequently, France's "The Surface" provides an idealistic and sentimental representation of love.
In contrast, John Agard's "Listen Mr Oxford Don" is written in a more assertive format. His language is more straightforward, critical, and direct, which exemplifies the reality of love. This form of language establishes a harsher undertone, painting a realistic impression of love.  Agard's poem holds a more violent tone, which is characterized by him constantly shouting "I will not!." The commanding language creates a confrontational ambiance that highlights the importance of the speaker's identity and the need to express themselves in the relationship. Consequently, Agard's "Listen Mr Oxford Don" presents a more realistic, confrontational perspective of love.
The structure of France's poem, "The Surface," reflects an idealistic perception of love as the verse seems to float effortlessly. Through numerous enjambments and commas, France introduces a gentle fluidity that assimilates with the sensuous language to create a dreamy and soothing depiction. The poem appears almost a sung recitation, with each line blending harmoniously into the next, creating a parallel with the idealized images of love. This unification of sound and structure in "The Surface" emphasizes the theme of idealistic love that France portrays.
In Agard's "Listen Mr Oxford Don," the form of the poem is used to emphasize the speaker's assertive identity. The poem uses repetitive phrasing and repetition to reinforce the identity of the speaker- "I will not, sir,"- the choice and self-assuredness of the speaker's tone reflecting an unyielding and rebellious attitude towards the Oxford don. Agard's decision to structure the work this way shows the importance of having an authentic identity in a relationship and refusing to be molded to conform to the other's expectations. The structure of "Listen Mr Oxford Don" reinforces the importance of expressing one's identity, particularly in a relationship, whereby both parties accept one another for who they are.
One particular issue that both poets interpret differently is the idea of unrequited love. In "The Surface," the imagery of "tender roots" provides a subtle analogy for this theme. The "tender roots" symbolize the vulnerability of the person in love, as the growth of the roots signifies the continuing devotion that goes unacknowledged. This theme reinforces the idea of idealistic love as it provides no resolution, and the reader's attention is focused on the sentiment of the central character. As a result, the poem's theme serves as an idealization of love, illustrating the power of adoration without any concrete return or recognition from the other person.
On the other hand, in Agard's "Listen Mr Oxford Don," unrequited love is handled differently. In contrast to France's idealized portrayal, Agard confronts the Oxford don, stating that the speaker's affections are genuine and worthwhile, even if they are ignored. Agard's insistent tone emphasizes the notion that being who you are and doing what you want is worth it, regardless of the other person's opinion.
The portrayal of love in both of these works tackles the themes of idealism and actuality. Linda France's "The Surface" presents an idealized, sentimental, and mystical depiction of love, while John Agard's "Listen Mr Oxford Don" approaches its portrayal realistically, assertively, and directly. Their use of language and form emphasizes the importance of showing oneself authentically in a relationship, regardless of the other's opinion. It is necessary to recognize that these works are both fundamentally distinct. However, through contrast and comparison, the message that divergences between idealism and actuality in love and the value of individual expression are crucial to a healthy relationship.
