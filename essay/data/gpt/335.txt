The haemagglutination and haemagglutination inhibition assay are widely used to identify the presence of viruses. The aim of the experiment is to evaluate whether the virus hemagglutinates red blood cells (RBC) and if it does so, identifying the type of virus and determining the intensity of the infection based on the quantity of viruses present in a given sample.
In haemagglutination, the virus attaches and binds to the surface of the RBC and causes them to clump together. The clumped cells form visible aggregates in the sample, which can be detected visually.
The haemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay, on the other hand, focuses on distinguishing antibodies from the antigen protein that the virus produces known to cause hemagglutination. The HI test measures the ability of a serum or a drug to inhibit the hemagglutination reaction.
In experiments conducted using these assays, the results showed that viruses could be identified by observing the aggregates formed in the tested samples. If the cells clumped, then the virus was present. Furthermore, the intensity of the hemagglutination reaction was used to measure the amount of virus present, giving information about the magnitude of the infection.
Additionally, if the hemagglutination inhibition test is performed, the presence of antibodies could be detected. Using the HI test, the level of antibodies would be determined by the amount of substance needed to stop the hemagglutination reaction.
In conclusion, the haemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition assays are crucial tests for the identification of different viruses. It is a useful tool for disease diagnosis and surveillance. These assays work based on the fact that certain viruses have the capacity to clump red blood cells together, creating visible aggregates.
Furthermore, with the HI test, it is possible to identify the presence of antibodies in a patient or the effectiveness of an antiviral drug. The results of these tests show that they are reliable, and when used correctly, they can provide valuable insights for health practitioners in determining the intensity of the infection.
