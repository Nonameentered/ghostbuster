Human Resource Management (HRM) is the strategic approach to managing employees in an organization, which aims to improve business performance by enhancing employee commitment and culture changes. HRM practices and characteristics such as effective communication, employee engagement initiatives, and recognition programs are essential in encouraging employees to commit to organizational goals and values while enhancing the overall culture of an organization. As such, in this essay, we will explore the characteristics and practices of HRM that encourage employee commitment and culture changes and consider the extent of good practice approaches used in the hospitality industry.
Effective Communication
One of the primary characteristics of HRM practices that can enhance employee commitment and culture changes is effective communication. Effective communication between management and employees can create a sense of transparency, encourage trust, and promote employee engagement. In a study conducted by Harris Interactive (2010), employees who reported that their bosses talk with them at least once a week have a higher level of agreement in their job satisfaction than those who communicate less often. HRM practices that encourage open communication include regular meetings with employees, newsletters, informal face to face chats, or group discussions. Employee engagement surveys can also help management understand employee challenges, perspectives, and make the necessary changes to address their concerns.
Moreover, HRM practices for communicating organizational values and goals are critical in encouraging employee commitment and culture changes. Leaders must articulate the organization's vision and mission statements, strategic goals, and values. They can do so through town hall meetings, focus groups, mission and vision workshops, as well as ongoing training and development programs. These efforts help employees understand how their roles align with the organizational objectives while acting as a guiding principle for workplace behavior and decision-making.
Employee Engagement Initiatives and Recognition Programs
Employee engagement initiatives and recognition programs are powerful tools that can enhance employee commitment and culture changes. Employee engagement initiatives include programs that promote employee well-being, personal growth, and career development, while recognition programs acknowledge employee performance and success. The hospitality industry has always been a labor-intensive business, and it has been well-documented that employee engagement is essential to organizational success in this industry. Therefore, HRM practices that prioritize employee engagement and recognition can translate into superior customer service, improved employee retention rates, and increased productivity.
Employee engagement initiatives include initiatives such as employee training and development programs, opportunities for career advancement, employee wellness programs, and workplace flexibility policies. Career development programs, for example, facilitate employee growth and career opportunities, and they provide a clear pathway to promotion, encouraging employee commitment to the organization. Employee wellness programs, such as gym memberships or healthy meal programs, can create a sense of care and concern for employee well-being, increasing their commitment to the organization.
Recognition programs, on the other hand, acknowledge employee achievements and performance. These programs can range from simple verbal praise to bonuses and rewards. The idea behind recognition programs is to reinforce positive behavior and encourage employees to replicate those behaviors. Rewards and bonuses have been found to be powerful motivators, as they provide employees with a tangible incentive for exceptional performance. Whereas verbal praise and recognition can boost employee morale and job satisfaction, increasing their commitment to the organization.
Extent of Good Practice Approaches in the Hospitality Industry
The hospitality industry has had a longstanding reputation for poor HRM practices, frequently resulting in high turnover rates and low employee commitment and engagement levels. Nonetheless, in recent years, the industry has shifted towards establishing better HRM practices which embrace employee commitment, retention, and engagement. Improved HRM practices in the hospitality industry may be attributed to the following factors:
First, the hospitality industry is becoming more competitive, with hotels, restaurants, and tourism businesses competing for the same customers. Thus, employee commitment, engagement, and retention can provide a competitive advantage by improving customer service and satisfaction, resulting in repeat business.
Secondly, The hospitality industry is recognizing that good HRM practices enhance organizational performance and productivity. As such, HRM practices such as effective communication, employee engagement initiatives, and recognition programs have become a vital component of many hospitality businesses' success.
Lastly, the rise of social media and review websites such as TripAdvisor has put businesses' reputations under scrutiny. Word of mouth is a powerful tool, and bad HRM practices and low employee engagement levels can quickly become public knowledge, damaging a business's reputation.
The extent of good practice approaches in the hospitality industry varies from one business to another. However, many hotels and restaurants are focusing on enhancing employee engagement through wellness programs, training and development initiatives, and recognition programs. For example, Hilton Worldwide has established a Care program, which focuses on employee well-being, leadership development, and career opportunities. The program acknowledges employee achievements through their Blue Energy award program, which celebrates employees who create remarkable guest experiences.
Similarly, the Benchmark Resorts & Hotels Group works to enhance employee engagement through career development initiatives, employee wellness programs, and recognition programs such as their quarterly Heroes recognition program, which acknowledges exceptional employee performance. The Leading Hotels of the World group has implemented employee engagement initiatives, including employee forums, employee assistance programs, and employee appreciation events.
Conclusion

Effective communication, employee engagement initiatives, and recognition programs are some of the characteristics of effective HRM approaches that encourage employee commitment and culture changes. In the hospitality industry, there has been a shift towards establishing better HRM practices that prioritize employee engagement, retention, and commitment.
