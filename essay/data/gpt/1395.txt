The enthalpy of vapourisation, also known as the heat of vaporisation, is a fundamental thermodynamic quantity parameter that describes the energy required to transform a liquid substance into its vapour state. This parameter is essential for the study of phase transitions and the control of industrial processes, such as distillation and evaporation. 
In order to determine the enthalpy of vapourisation of a substance, it is common to use an experimental procedure that involves measuring the amount of heat absorbed during the phase transition at a constant pressure. The experiments are usually performed with a calorimeter, which is a device that allows the precise measurement of the temperature changes that occur during the process. 
To measure the enthalpy of vapourisation of liquid nitrogen and carbon dioxide, a procedure was developed that involved the use of a constant-volume adiabatic calorimeter. This type of calorimeter is designed to isolate the sample from the surroundings, preventing heat transfer with the environment during the experiment. 
The experimental procedure involved charging the calorimeter with a known mass of the liquid sample, which was then allowed to vaporise at a constant pressure. The temperature changes associated with the phase transition were monitored by means of two thermometers, one placed inside the calorimeter and the other outside, which allowed the calculation of the amount of heat absorbed by the sample during the process. 
Among the potential sources of uncertainty in the measurements, one of the most significant is the estimation of the heat capacity of the sample and the calorimeter. This parameter is usually obtained through calibration experiments, which involve heating or cooling the calorimeter with known quantities of heat and measuring the resulting temperature changes. 
Another potential source of uncertainty is the measurement of the pressure during the experiment, which can affect the boiling point of the sample and, consequently, the measured enthalpy of vaporisation. To minimize this effect, the pressure was carefully monitored and controlled throughout the experiment. 
Finally, the accuracy of the thermometers used to measure the temperature changes can also affect the precision of the measurements. To improve the accuracy, sophisticated instrumentation and calibration procedures were employed. 
In conclusion, the experimental procedure used to measure the enthalpy of vapourisation of liquid nitrogen and carbon dioxide involved the use of a constant-volume adiabatic calorimeter and careful monitoring of various sources of uncertainty, such as the heat capacity of the sample and the calorimeter, the pressure, and the thermometers. By minimizing these sources of error, it was possible to obtain accurate and reliable measurements of the enthalpy of vapourisation, which are essential for the development and optimization of industrial processes.
