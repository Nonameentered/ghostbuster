Introduction
Branding is considered a vital aspect of marketing and remains significant in international business. In an increasingly competitive market, creating a unique brand identity is crucial for successful competition. Brands are powerful tools that can help companies to create awareness, generate loyalty, and improve profitability. However, companies can either adopt a corporate branding strategy or a local branding strategy when taking their brand internationally. This paper examines the advantages and disadvantages of using a corporate branding strategy when taking a brand internationally.
Advantages of Using a Corporate Branding Strategy when Taking a Brand Internationally
1. Creates a strong market identity
A corporate branding strategy creates a consistent identity for the company. This strategy creates a standard perception of the company and its brand, regardless of location globally. The consistency of the corporate brand allows for brand recognition and loyalty, making it more straightforward to penetrate new markets. This underscores the significance of a consistent marketing program highlighting the brand attributes, values, and features.
2. Eases customer recognition
A corporate brand makes it easier for customers to recognize the company, regardless of location. The brand provides a company with a distinct identity, such that it becomes easy for customers to understand the brand's benefits and quality irrespective of the location. Consequently, customers will look for a brand that they know and trust, leading to better customer acceptance and increased sales.
3. Helps in brand transferability
A corporate brand's benefit is that it can be used across different markets and geographies. The brand's reputation can thus be used to promote new products or services in other markets. This gives a company an opportunity to leverage its established brand name in new markets, which can help them gain recognition and customer loyalty.
4. Increases brand equity
Using a corporate brand strategy when taking a brand internationally can increase brand equity. A company can leverage brand equity gained in the local market to gain a foothold in international markets. For instance, a company can leverage its strong reputation in one country when entering another, thus saving on promotional costs. This way, a company can keep and grow its existing customer base while expanding to new markets.
5. Cost-effective
Using a corporate brand strategy can be cost-effective for a company when taking a brand internationally. It is expensive to start from scratch in each new country, project local needs properly, research the market, and build trust with the audience. By creating and maintaining a brand, a company can save a great deal on marketing and advertising costs.
Disadvantages of Using a Corporate Branding Strategy when Taking a Brand Internationally
1. Loss of Cultural Sensitivity
Using a corporate branding strategy risks ignoring the local culture and its significance on the target audience. When entering a new market, cultural sensitivity is paramount. Many companies have failed to adapt to the culture of the new audience, leading to failure. A corporate branding strategy might undermine the local brand's culture, risking the loss of an opportunity to leverage a local brand's recognition and loyalty.
2. Limits creativity
A corporate branding strategy limits the ability of local offices or partners to make branding decisions. It means that once a corporate brand is established, it remains the same across different markets, regardless of the local culture and customer preferences. This can limit creativity and restrict branding efforts, particularly where the local culture requires a specific approach.
3. Challenges local staff
Using a corporate branding strategy can create challenges for the local staff working to establish the brand. As the corporate brand already has a defined image globally, the staff will have little opportunity to make decisions that can differentiate the brand in the local market. This can lead to a lack of job satisfaction and can hinder the effort to build the brand locally.
4. High standards needed
Corporate branding strategies require high standards in brand management. The brand's consistency hinges on maintaining high standards, particularly in regions where the company has no existing presence. Deviation from the established brand guidelines can lead to a drop in the brand's reputation, thereby affecting the entire business operation.
5. Corporate reputation risk
Using a corporate branding strategy poses a significant risk since the reputation of a company may be portrayed negatively in one local market, affecting the brand's reputation globally. Therefore, the risk of negative publicity for one local activity or operation can lead to a decline in brand reputation worldwide.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a corporate branding strategy has advantages and disadvantages when taking a brand internationally. While it creates a strong market identity, eases customer recognition, helps in brand transferability, increases brand equity, and is cost-effective, it risks ignoring the local culture and its significance on the target audience, limits creativity, challenges local staff, requires high standards, and poses a corporate reputation risk. Companies need to weigh the pros and cons carefully before deciding on a corporate branding strategy to ensure successful brand penetration globally.
