Introduction:
Globalisation is a multifaceted process that is reshaping and redefining the global economy, culture and social life. The project of globalisation is not gender-neutral, and gender inequality is a prevalent feature of globalisation. Globalisation has impacted men and women differently depending on their gender role, and gender has played a significant role in shaping the project of globalisation. The purpose of this essay is to explore the interrelationship between gender and globalisation and how gender has shaped the project of globalisation. The essay addresses four issues, including the flexibilisation of the labour force shaped the project of globalisation, structural adjustment programmes' role in enmeshing women into patriarchal structures within globalisation and capitalism, the impact of transnational migration on gender identity and the concept of "global imperialism" and whether there has been a globalisation from below that has enabled women to resist the patriarchal forces within globalisation.
Flexibilisation of the Labour Force shaped the project of globalisation:
The flexibilisation of the labour force is a critical feature of globalisation and is defined by a shift towards non-standard employment relationships, including temporary, part-time and self-employment. The flexibility of the labour force has been a focal point of globalisation as companies seek to cut costs and increase profit margins by exploiting lower-cost, flexible labour markets in developing countries. The process of flexibilisation has also had a significant impact on gender relations, leading to increased gender inequality.
The flexibilisation of the labour force has excluded or disadvantaged women in several ways. Firstly, women are disproportionately represented in low-paid, insecure jobs, and part-time work, which undermines their economic power and social status. Flexible employment opportunities have not always led to greater economic parity for women who are often forced into low-wage jobs and rely on meagre social welfare provisions. According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), women represent almost 60% of those not covered by any form of social protection. As a result, women's economic vulnerability is exacerbated by the lack of social protection and benefits associated with non-standard employment relationships.
Secondly, the lack of job security, wage protection and access to social protection negatively affects women's bargaining power in the labour market. This, in turn, perpetuates the gender wage gap, increases their labour force participation rate and acts as a structural barrier to achieving economic empowerment and social mobility. Women are also more likely to have to take time off work to care for family members, resulting in fewer opportunities for career development and a loss of earning potential.
Structural Adjustment Programmes:
Structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) were introduced in the 1980s by international financial institutions as a condition of lending to developing countries. The primary goal of these programmes was to restructure the economies of these countries by reducing public expenditure, liberalisation of trade, and the removal of subsidies. These programmes shaped globalisation by introducing neoliberal economic policies and market-driven reforms around the world.
SAPs have played a significant role in enmeshing women into patriarchal structures within globalisation and capitalism. The introduction of neoliberal economic and social policies has had a devastating impact on women's economic empowerment, social status and political participation. SAPs have led to the erosion of the state's provision of social services such as healthcare, education and pensions, placing a significant burden on women, who are expected to provide these services within the family unit. Women are also expected to provide a cheap source of labour for export industries, maquiladoras and service sectors.
SAPs have exacerbated inequalities within the labour market, entrenched structural unemployment and casualisation, particularly affecting women and young people. As a result, the formal economy has shrunk, and informalisation and precarious work have increased significantly, with women bearing the brunt of these changes. These conditions have created a vicious cycle of poverty and debt that is particularly challenging for women to escape from.
Impact of transnational migration on gender identity:
Transnational migration is defined as the movement of individuals or families across national borders to seek employment opportunities or improve their living standards. Migration has become a significant trend in recent decades due to globalisation. For women, transnational migration has had a complex impact on gender identity, reinforcing traditional patriarchal norms while also providing new opportunities for gender empowerment.
Transnational migration has provided the base for the new global economy, with migrant workers being essential to the development of export-oriented industries. Women, in particular, have become the preferred labour force in many sectors, such as domestic work, care work and the export-oriented garment industry. The feminisation of labour in these sectors reflects patriarchal attitudes towards women's work and their role in society.
The impact of transnational migration on gender identity has been significant, particularly in regards to domestic labour. Domestic work is one of the most challenging and exploitative sectors of the global economy, with women often working in inhumane conditions with little pay and no legal protection. This reinforces traditional gender roles, with women expected to perform care-giving duties within the family unit and provide domestic labour in the wider economy. This is often at the expense of their personal autonomy, economic and social power.
Global Imperialism and Globalisation from Below:
Global imperialism is defined as the domination of capitalist economies over poorer countries. Globalisation has facilitated global imperialism by creating a global market that prioritises the interests of transnational corporations and wealthy nations at the expense of the Global South. This has perpetuated exploitation, environmental degradation and poverty in developing countries.
Gender has also played a significant role in shaping the concept of global imperialism. In particular, globalisation has reinforced patriarchal attitudes towards women's work and roles within society. Women are often relegated to the most impoverished and precarious sections of the labour market, reinforcing gender inequality and impoverishment within the Global South.
However, there has also been a globalisation from below that has enabled women to resist the patriarchal forces within globalisation. Women's organisations, social movements and NGOs have played a significant role in promoting social justice and gender equity. For instance, the international campaign for domestic workers' rights, led by domestic workers themselves, has resulted in the adoption of the International Labour Organization's Convention No.189, which establishes the right of domestic workers to collective representation, fair working conditions and equal treatment.
Conclusion:
Gender has shaped the project of globalisation in prominent ways, leading to increasing gender inequality, particularly for women in developing countries. The flexibilisation of the labour force, the introduction of SAPs, the impact of transnational migration and global imperialism have all contributed to creating patriarchal structures within the global economy. However, there is also evidence of globalisation from below, with women's movements resisting these patriarchal forces and promoting social justice and gender equity.
