Maternal effect genes (MEGs) are genes that encode maternally expressed proteins and play a crucial role in early embryonic development. These genes are the main contributors to the formation of the embryonic axes in many organisms. Among several species, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is an ideal model organism for studying maternal-effect genes, as it undergoes a stereotyped and well-characterized developmental program. The maternal effect genes in C. elegans regulate various developmental pathways that are essential for normal embryonic development.
Early embryonic development in C. elegans begins with a series of asymmetric cell divisions that produce cells with distinct developmental fates. Asymmetric cell division is a highly regulated process in which the mother cell divides into two daughter cells of different sizes and developmental potentials. In C. elegans, this process begins with the formation of a single-cell embryo, which undergoes a series of embryonic cell divisions to form the adult animal. During these divisions, the cell division plane is strictly oriented along the anterior-posterior and dorso-ventral axes, which are established in the early stages of embryonic development.
The establishment of the anterior-posterior, dorso-ventral, and left-right axes of the embryonic cells is a crucial step in C. elegans embryonic development. Maternal-effect genes play an essential role in establishing these axes through localized cues and cell-to-cell interactions. These genes are involved in the specification of cell fates and the development of positional information in the early embryo. The anterior-posterior axis is established through the localization of MEGs, which directs the localization of PAR proteins. The dorso-ventral axis is established through asymmetric cell division, and the left-right axis is established through the differential localization of PAR proteins.
The localization and function of PAR proteins are critical for embryonic patterning in C. elegans. PAR proteins are a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins that are involved in establishing cellular polarity and asymmetric cell division. These proteins are localized to specific regions of the cell membrane, where they regulate the formation of the cytoskeleton and control the distribution of regulatory molecules. PAR proteins in C. elegans are localized to the anterior and posterior regions of the cell during the first cell division, and they play a critical role in the establishment of the anterior-posterior axis. They are essential for the subsequent formation of the posterior germ line and somatic cells.  
MEG MEX-5 and MEX-6 play key roles in cell fate specification. These two proteins are localized to the posterior pole of the C. elegans embryo, where they regulate the distribution of important cellular factors. MEX-5 prevents the accumulation of certain RNAs in the posterior region of the embryo and silences their translation. MEX-6, in contrast, promotes the localization and translation of RNAs that specify the germ line cells. The combined action of MEX-5 and MEX-6 is critical for the normal development of the germ line. The absence of both genes leads to the formation of an abnormal embryonic pole, which results in the failure of the germ line establishment.
SKN-1 is a transcription factor that plays an essential role in embryonic development. This factor is necessary for promoting the expression of genes involved in the formation of the gut in C. elegans. SKN-1 is localized to the anterior region of the embryo, where it promotes the formation of the gut primordia. SKN-1 is also essential for the development of the mesoderm. The absence of SKN-1 leads to the formation of an abnormal embryonic gut and a failure in the formation of the mesoderm and pharynx.
Several mutations in MEGs have been studied, which have a profound effect on embryonic development in C. elegans. The mutation of MEX-5 and MEX-6 genes leads to the formation of an abnormal embryonic pole. The absence of SKN-1 leads to the failure of gut primordia formation and embryonic mesodermal cells. The manipulation of PAR proteins leads to the formation of abnormal anterior-posterior and dorso-ventral axes. These mutations often result in the defective formation of certain tissues and organs, and sometimes, to embryonic lethality. 
In conclusion, maternally expressed genes play a critical role in early embryonic development in C. elegans and other organisms. These genes regulate various developmental pathways that are essential for normal embryonic development. The establishment of the anterior-posterior, dorso-ventral, and left-right axes of the embryonic cells is a crucial stage in C. elegans embryonic development, and MEGs play an essential role in creating localized cues and cell-to-cell interactions necessary for the establishment of these axes. PAR proteins, MEX-5 and MEX-6, and SKN-1 are all involved in various developmental pathways, which are essential for the normal formation of the embryonic axis, cell fates, and organogenesis. Mutations in these genes highlight their significant role in C. elegans embryonic development, affecting embryonic survival and the formation of diverse tissues and organs.
