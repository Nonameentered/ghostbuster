Decision making is an integral part of human existence that takes place continuously, from everyday trivial choices to consequential choices that might have long term consequences. Decision making is, therefore, a central element of many fields, such as economics, psychology, and sociology. The study of decision making is interesting because decision makers are often confronted with uncertainty and must take risks to achieve their goals. Additionally, decisions must often be made within a limited amount of time. Two concepts are often examined in decision making: temporal discounting and risk aversion. This essay will examine the relationship between these concepts and discuss how normative theories of decision making differ from prospect theory. Finally, it will discuss how these concepts can be applied in real-world decision making.
Temporal discounting is the process by which individuals place a lower value on rewards that will be received in the future compared to rewards that will be received immediately. It is a type of bias that results from peopleâ€™s preferences for immediate gratification over long-term benefits. The concept of temporal discounting can be examined in economic theory as a form of inter-temporal or time preference. The study of temporal discounting has been informed by the work of Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, who have studied a variety of heuristics and biases that affect decision making. This work suggests that the degree of temporal discounting affects how people make decisions.
Risk aversion, on the other hand, is the preference for certain outcomes over risky outcomes, even if the potential rewards of the latter are higher. Risk aversion is an emotional response to the potential loss of a reward. It is often seen as the opposite of risk taking, where an individual is willing to tolerate risk for potential rewards, even if the rewards are unknown. However, the level of risk aversion can vary from person to person. Some individuals can be more risk-averse than others, depending on their personal circumstances and past experiences.
The relationship between temporal discounting and risk aversion can be complex, as they often interact and influence each other. For instance, an individual may be willing to accept a higher degree of risk in the present if the potential reward is significant. However, the same individual may display risk aversion when the risk is high, but the potential reward is not large enough to justify the risk. This means that the level of temporal discounting and risk aversion are both important factors in determining how individuals approach decision making.
In economic theory, normative theories of decision making, such as expected utility theory (EUT), are based on a set of assumptions that individuals act rationally by choosing the option that maximizes their expected utility. EUT assumes that individuals are risk-neutral and base their choices on the probability of outcomes and the expected value of these outcomes. However, this theory has been criticized for being unrealistic, as individuals may not be able to estimate probabilities or may have subjective feelings toward risk that affect their decision making. Nevertheless, EUT remains an influential normative theory of decision making in economics.
Prospect theory, developed by Kahneman and Tversky in 1979, attempts to address some of the shortcomings of EUT by combining descriptive and normative elements. Prospect theory recognizes that individuals often make irrational decisions due to heuristics and biases and that subjective feelings towards gain and loss affect decision making. According to prospect theory, individuals are risk-averse when it comes to gains but risk-seeking when it comes to losses. This means that individuals are more motivated by avoiding losses than by maximizing gains. Prospect theory also suggests that individuals use reference points to evaluate their experiences, and that the weighting of probabilities is not always the same in decision making.
The concepts of temporal discounting and risk aversion, as well as normative theories of decision making including EUT and prospect theory, can be applied in real-world decision making across a range of fields, such as health care, finance, and environmental policy.
In health care, temporal discounting and risk aversion can affect decisions regarding the use of preventative measures. For instance, individuals may prioritize immediate pleasure over long-term health outcomes, leading to a higher prevalence of unhealthy behaviors such as smoking or lack of exercise. Health interventions can be designed to overcome such behaviors by using strategies that take into account temporal discounting and risk aversion. For instance, smoking cessation programs offer immediate incentives such as nicotine patches or gum to encourage people to quit smoking.
In finance, temporal discounting and risk aversion can affect investment decisions. Individuals may be more likely to invest in risky assets if they have a high degree of temporal discounting. Financial advisors can use this information to recommend investment strategies based on an individual's level of temporal discounting and risk aversion.
In environmental policy, temporal discounting and risk aversion play a significant role in decisions about long-term environmental sustainability. Individuals may discount the future environmental costs of current actions, leading to short-term thinking and unsustainable behavior. In such cases, policymakers can use strategies to incentivize sustainable behavior by promoting immediate incentives such as tax relief or financial incentives.
In conclusion, the concepts of temporal discounting and risk aversion are critical factors that affect decision making. The relationship between these concepts can be complex and can influence how individuals approach decision making. Furthermore, normative theories of decision making such as EUT and prospect theory provide different viewpoints on how individuals make judgments and are critical for understanding the role of heuristics and biases in decision making. Finally, the application of these concepts in real-world decision making can help policymakers design interventions and strategies that are tailored to the specific needs of individuals and promote better outcomes.
