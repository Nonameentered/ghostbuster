The understanding of electrical circuits and how they operate is significantly crucial in the field of electrical engineering. The experiment, which involves a circuit with resistance and inductance connected in series, is designed to investigate the impact of inductance on the function of a single circuit. This research aims to demonstrate the results and relationship between the number of turns and inductance, as well as the impact of a capacitor in counteracting the inductor's effects. Additionally, this essay will explain the concept of harmonics in circuits and how inductors act as low-pass filters, while providing specific details and data from the experiment to support the explanations.
The purpose of connecting a resistance and an inductance in series in a circuit is to understand how circuits with inductors operate in comparison to circuits without inductors. An inductor typically obstructs the flow of sudden and alternating currents, leading to a reduction in the current when the voltage is initially supplied. This action causes the circuit to retard the amount of time It requires to build the current, with the inductor producing an electric field around itself to counteract the changes in the current flow. By conducting this experiment, one can achieve a comprehensive understanding of how the inductance value affects the circuit.
When conducting this experiment, inductance is provided via a coil. The number of turns is adjusted to provide an array of inductance values in the series circuit. From the experiment, it is apparent that the inductance value has significant implications for circuits that utilise inductors. It should be noted that the inductance value is directly proportional to the amount of voltage that an inductor can resist, while current is inversely proportional. Therefore, an increase in inductance will lead to an increase in resistance while reducing the amount of current that follows the current's voltage supplied.
Moreover, when the inductance is increased, the electromagnetic force (EMF) produced by the inductor counteracts the voltage to impede the current flow. This delay is known as "inductive reactance" and is directly proportional to the inductance value. Therefore, increasing the amount of inductance leads to a decrease in the amount of current and an increase in resistance.
While inductors' effects on the circuit are generally unfavourable, capacitors can be used to counteract an inductor's effects. Capacitors are components that store electricity and discharge it when required. Capacitance varies with the material and dimensions of the capacitor plates utilized and is measured in farads.
When the capacitor is used to counteract the inductor, the voltage across the capacitor rises exponentially as the current through the inductor is decreased. As the inductor's current redirects, the capacitor will discharge again at the circuit's same rate used earlier. Therefore, the time frame of the shift in current is accelerated by the capacitor, producing opposite angular frequencies of Current and Voltage. As a result, the capacitor's lack of a phase shift complements the inductor's phase shift.
The capacitor and inductor are used as electronic components in frequency filters, where the capacitor's parallel arrangement with an inductor, at the right frequency, provides a short circuit. However, at high voltage levels, the  Capacitor and Inductors produce different impacts. Hence the analysis of Ohms Law, Current, and Voltage becomes indispensable.
Additionally, the harmonics in circuits is an essential aspect of the study of electrical engineering. A harmonic is a sine wave with a frequency that's a multiple of the fundamental frequency. The harmonic series produces the different frequencies across a resonant circuit with multiple inductors and capacitors. An inductor is used as a low-pass filter, which means that the filter allows the lower frequencies of the input to pass through while suppressing higher ones.
When a high-frequency noise signal is introduced into the circuit, inductive reactance makes it hard for the current to flow across the inductor, hence creating a voltage drop between the output and the input. Subsequently, it gets progressively more robust across the circuit, getting to its highest voltage. Hence the inductors in circuits act as low-pass filters to reduce the unwanted frequencies.
In conclusion, the experiment involving a circuit with resistance and inductance connected in series is geared toward understanding how circuits with inductors operate and how they can be manipulated. It is revealed that the inductance value has significant implications for circuits that feature inductors. This effect can be counteracted by using capacitors, which store and discharge electrical energy when needed. Additionally, the Harmonics in Circuits and how inductors act as Low-Pass Filters is an essential aspect of analysing electrical engineering. The capacitor and the Inductor are an essential component, paired with resistance, capacitor, and Harmonics in Circuits, to build numerous designs with their ramifications and usage. Thus, we can theorize that the experiment carried out is essential in understanding the operation of electrical circuits, including the aforementioned component's roles.
