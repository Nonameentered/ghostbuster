The Mitsubishi M16C microcontroller family is a range of powerful, 16-bit microcontrollers that are widely used in a variety of applications. Laboratory experiments were conducted to explore the capabilities of the M16C/62 microcontroller, as well as the use of various software and hardware elements that can be used to interface with it.
The objective of the laboratories was to teach students how to program the microcontroller and to interface it with various hardware components. These hardware components included 7-segment displays and push-button switches. The procedure for this experiment began with an overview of the M16C/62 microcontroller and its basic programming concepts. The author then demonstrated how to use Appendix A, B, and C to determine the proper driving of the 7 segment display devices and push button switches.
Appendix A provided details on how the pins of the 7-segment display should be connected to the microcontroller. This information was crucial in determining how the display would be driven. Appendix B provided similar information for the push-button switches. Appendix C gave instructions on how to write a program to control the display devices and the push-button switches.
The hardware elements featured in this experiment included the microcontroller board, 7-segment display devices, and push-button switches. The author connected these components using jumper wires and a breadboard. To power up the microcontroller board, the author used a USB cable and connected it to the computer.
Two program files, Assi1.c and Assl2i.c, were used to control the 7-segment displays and push-button switches. The first program, Assi1.c, was used to light up segments on the displays based on user inputs via push-button switches. The second program, Assl2i.c, was used to demonstrate multiplexing techniques by scrolling a message across multiple displays.
To obtain expected results from the programs, the author began by compiling and uploading the code to the microcontroller board. Once the code was successfully uploaded, the author then pressed the push-button switches to control the display devices. The author successfully obtained the expected results from the programs through this method.
In conclusion, the laboratories that focused on the Mitsubishi M16C/62 microcontroller family had the objective of teaching students how to program the microcontroller and interface it with various hardware components. The author utilized Appendix A, B, and C to determine the proper driving of the 7-segment display devices and push-button switches. The hardware elements featured in the experiment included the microcontroller board, 7-segment display devices, and push-button switches, which were connected using jumper wires and a breadboard. The two program files, Assi1.c, and Assl2i.c, were used for controlling the displays and push-button switches. Finally, the author successfully obtained the expected results from the programs through the use of push-button switches to control the display devices and multiplexing techniques.
