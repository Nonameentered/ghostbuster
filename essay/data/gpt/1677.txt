Introduction
In the current era, tourism has emerged as one of the significant industries globally. The industry contributes significantly to the economy of countries across the globe by creating jobs, earning revenue, and supporting the hospitality and leisure sectors (Kim, Lee & Yoo, 2017). Advances in technology have revolutionized the tourism sector, promoting the growth of online tourism platforms. Online tourism platforms such as booking.com, TripAdvisor, and Expedia have become a significant point of reference for travelers when deciding on their next vacation destinations.
Tourism destination websites play a pivotal role in influencing travelers' decisions by providing them with a visual impression of the destination. Visuals not only provide aesthetic value but also deliver information about the tourism destination. However, visual content on tourism destination websites is subject to interpretation and preference, which are influenced by an individual's gender. Gender plays a vital role in shaping people's perceptions, and subsequently, their interpretation of what they see. As such, it influences their decision-making process and behavior, which affects their travel choices. 
This paper aims to examine the influence of gender on the interpretation and preference of visual content on tourism destination websites. It will explore the role of visual communication in online marketing strategies and its impact on consumers' decision-making and behavior. The study will also look at the existing literature on marketing communication, visual communication, consumer behavior, and gender studies to examine the interconnected relation between the internet, online visual communication, and gender difference. Finally, the paper will offer recommendations for more effective internet marketing strategies and website design in the tourism industry. 
Visual Communication in Online Marketing Strategies
Visual communication in online marketing strategies plays a critical role in influencing consumers' behavior. Online visuals are essential marketing tools as they can create emotional connections that lead to consumers' engagement with the product or service being advertised. Visuals help in providing information, reducing ambiguity, and increasing consumer's trust in the product or service being marketed (Chang & Chou, 2015). Visuals are also used to enhance the aesthetics of the product or destination being advertised, making them more appealing to consumers. 
Tourism destination websites use visual communication to provide potential visitors with a glimpse of what to expect when they visit the destination. The visuals used range from images, videos, graphics, and animations, carefully designed to showcase the destination's scenic beauty, attractions, and cultural diversity. By doing so, the website aims to create a positive impression and emotional connection with the audience. 
Gender and Consumer Behavior
Gender is a critical factor that influences consumer behavior. Research has established that there are differences between men and women in their consumption patterns, decision-making processes, and preferences (Schroeder & Borgerson, 2017). Gender influences consumers' motivation, attitudes, and expectations towards products, services, and experiences, including tourism destinations. 
Research on gender and tourism suggests that women tend to be more influenced by social and cultural factors when making travel decisions than men. Women are more likely to travel with family, seeking experiential tourism that includes adventure, cultural immersion, and art (Kim, Lee & Yoo, 2017). On the other hand, men tend to be more influenced by competitive and achievement-oriented factors, such as sports and adventure travel. Men are also more attracted to activities that involve high risk, competition, and challenge (Kim, Lee & Yoo, 2017).
The Influence of Gender on Interpretation and Preference of Visual Content on Tourism Destination Websites
Gender influences how audiences interpret and prefer visual content on tourism destination websites. Research has shown that gender has a significant impact on the types of visual content that men and women prefer. Women tend to prefer visual content that aligns with their emotional connections to a destination. Women's preferences lean towards softer, natural, and cultural visuals that create a sense of relaxation, comfort, and emotion (Bao & Huang, 2017). Women tend to enjoy images that showcase the destination's serene natural beauty, cultural heritage, and art. In contrast, men prefer visual content that aligns with their competitive spirit and achievement orientation. Men's preference leans towards action-packed visuals that feature adventure sports, challenging activities, and physical fitness (Bao & Huang, 2017). 
The influence of gender on the interpretation of visual content is also evident in the way people perceive images differently. Research suggests that men and women interpret visual information differently. Men are good at spatial and visual perception, while women are better at verbal and emotional perception (Chang & Chou, 2015). As such, women tend to interpret visual information better when it is accompanied by descriptive and explanatory text. In contrast, men rely less on textual information when interpreting visual content. Instead, they tend to focus on the visual features such as color, contrast, and composition (Chang & Chou, 2015).
The Interconnected Relation between the Internet, Online Visual Communication, and Gender Difference
The internet has revolutionized the tourism industry, making it easier for travelers to research and plan their trips. As technology advances, visual communication in tourism has turned to online platforms, particularly websites and social media. These online platforms offer vast opportunities for marketers to influence consumers' decision-making processes by creating visual content that aligns with their preferences. 
Online visual communication is subject to gender differences, reflecting the underlying societal norms, values, and cultures. Society uses gender as a way of categorizing individuals into two distinct categories that have different roles, behaviors and expectations. As such, gender norms are reflected in the products and services offered, as well as the way they are marketed. In the tourism industry, gender norms influence the type of imagery used on websites and visual communication to appeal to either male or female audiences (Schroeder & Borgerson, 2017). For example, images of family vacations with children are more likely to appeal to women than men. Similarly, images featuring adventure sports are likely to appeal more to men than women.
Recommendations for More Effective Internet Marketing Strategies and Website Design in the Tourism Industry
To improve internet marketing strategies and website design in the tourism industry, marketers need to understand the differences in gender preferences for visual content. First, tourism destination websites need to be designed with different audiences in mind. The website's design should take into consideration the gender norms, values, and preferences that influence the interpretation of visual content by the target audience. The imagery used should be consistent with the destination's brand values and appeal to the intended audience. The website's design should also balance the use of textual information and visual content, ensuring that visitors have access to necessary information to make informed decisions.
Second, tourism marketers need to use data analytics to monitor the effectiveness of visual communication strategies on their websites. Data analytics can help track user engagement with visual content, identifying which visuals appeal to which audiences and how they influence their decision-making processes. This information can help marketers adjust their strategies and improve their visual content to increase audience engagement and ultimately increase their revenue.
Third, tourism destination marketers need to recognize the diversity within gender norms and create content that appeals to a broader range of audiences. Marketers should aim to provide different visual content that caters to the diverse interests of their audience beyond gender stereotypes. For example, marketers can create visuals showcasing destinations that appeal to both men and women based on shared interests, such as cultural heritage, local cuisine, and eco-tourism.
Finally, marketers need to use social media platforms to extend their visual communication strategies beyond their website's boundaries. Social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube are valuable marketing tools that can increase the visibility of visual content. Tourism destination marketers can use these platforms to create viral marketing campaigns that showcase their destination's beauty, their unique features, and cultural experiences that appeal to both male and female audiences.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the interpretation and preference of visual content on tourism destination websites are influenced by gender. Gender norms, values, and expectations influence consumers' decision-making processes and behavior, affecting their travel choices. Therefore, it is imperative for tourism destination marketers to create visual content that resonates with their target audience and encourages engagement. Internet marketing strategies must be informed by an understanding of gender differences to adapt to the diverse consumption patterns of different audiences. Effective visual communication strategies require a combination of textual and visual information, data analytics, website design, and social media marketing. By implementing these strategies, tourism destination marketers can improve the effectiveness of their marketing campaigns, attract more visitors, and boost their revenues.
