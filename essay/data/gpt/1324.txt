Introduction:
Freezing processes have become an integral part of our lifestyle to preserve and store food products for a longer period. Refrigeration systems are built to fulfil our basic needs of preservation and prevent the growth of microorganisms in food products. The principles underlying the freezing process are based on science, namely thermodynamics, heat transfer, and phase transition. Effective freezing requires an understanding of the fundamental principles of phase transition and refrigerants' chemical properties. There are numerous refrigeration systems utilized, but the basic principles remain the same. The freezing time for a particular type of freezer can be estimated using basic equations and calculations. This essay will discuss the principles underlying the freezing process, different refrigeration systems, the preliminary processes for foods prior to refrigeration, and how the freezing time for a particular type of freezer can be estimated.
Principles underlying the Freezing processes:
The fundamental principle of the freezing process is that when a liquid is subjected to a temperature lower than its freezing point, it will convert into a solid. The phase transition from liquid to solid occurs when the liquid's temperature is reduced below its freezing point, and the latent heat is removed. During the freezing process, sensible heat is released from the food product as it cools. Simultaneously, the released heat is absorbed by refrigerants for their evaporation, resulting in the transfer of heat from the food products to the refrigerants. This sensible heat removal cools the food products, enabling them to reach the low-temperature state where the food product is below its freezing point. At this stage, the latent heat released during the phase transition releases large amounts of energy, which must be absorbed by the refrigerants to maintain the food products' low temperature.
The principal thermodynamic processes in refrigeration systems are the compression and expansion of refrigerants. The refrigerant works by passing through the evaporator where it absorbs the sensible heat from the food products. The refrigerant then passes through the compressor where it is compressed to a higher pressure and sent to the condenser to release the absorbed heat to the external environment. After this, the condensed refrigerant flows through the expansion valve providing pressure reduction. Upon passing through the valve, the refrigerant experiences rapid reduction in pressure generating low-temperature to absorb the heat from the food product to cause phase transition. This thermodynamic process completes the refrigeration cycle and the process is repeated until the desired temperature is achieved.
Different Refrigeration Systems:
There are numerous refrigeration systems with different designs utilized in the food and beverage industry. Each system's design is based on different principles of cooling capacity and freezing capabilities, which determine the temperature range required to store different types of food products.
The most common refrigeration system is the mechanical refrigeration system that operates based on the principles of pressure change and evaporation. The mechanical refrigeration system has four fundamental components, namely; compressors, evaporators, expansion valves, and condensers. The compressors receive the refrigerant gas from the evaporator, compress it to high pressure and send it to the condenser. The refrigerant gas then flows to the expansion valve through which its pressure and temperature are reduced and sent to the evaporator. The cycle is continuously repeated until the desired temperature range is achieved. 
Another type of refrigeration system is absorption refrigeration, where the refrigeration effect is produced through absorbing refrigerants using absorbent solutions. Absorption refrigeration uses chemical interactions and processes rather than mechanical compression by utilizing two fluids, the absorbent and refrigerant, to produce the required cooling effect. Water-lithium bromide is a typical example of a primary refrigerant-absorbent pair.
Another type of refrigeration system is the cascade refrigerator system - comprised of two independent refrigeration systems connected in series. The cooling effect and temperature range depend on the refrigerants chosen to configure the two systems. This system can be designed to produce a very low-temperature range needed for specific applications like aerospace, military, and research laboratories. One of the most important benefits of using cascade refrigeration for low-temperature applications is the segregation of refrigerants to avoid mixing, which could cause flaws and issues with the refrigeration cycle.
Preliminary Processes for Foods prior to Refrigeration:
Prior to refrigeration, there are various preliminary processes that are carried out to mitigate the harmful effects of freezing on the quality of the food products. Blanching is one such process where the food items are briefly placed in boiling water to kill the microorganisms present on their surfaces. The process also facilitates the removal of the skin or peelings through shock and aids in preserving the food product's texture and colour. Another preliminary process is dehydrating food products, either through exposure to air or in a dehydrator. Dehydration reduces the moisture content in the food item, preventing the growth of microbes that thrive in humid conditions. Also, it aids in the preservation of the food item along with preserving its taste and texture. Furthermore, salting and smoking are also utilized to enhance the preservation and flavour of food products. These processes facilitate the active removal and prevention of microbial growth on the surfaces of the food products during refrigeration.
Freezing Time for a Particular Type of Freezer:
The freezing time for a particular type of freezer depends on the type of freezer, the size of the food products or items, and the desired final temperature of the food product. The freezing time is dependent on the duration required for the food product to reach its desired temperature. A basic equation used in calculating the freezing time is the thermal conductivity of the food product. The thermal conductivity of the food products is used to calculate the heat transfer rate that dissipates away from the food product and facilitates its cooling as it undergoes phase transition. The thermal conductivity of the food products is calculated using the following equation: 
k = (Q × L) / (T1 - T2) × (A × ΔT
where k is the thermal conductivity of food products displayed in Watts/meter kelvin, Q is the heat transported through the food product, L the length through which heat interacts with the food product, T1 temperature of the refrigerated air, T2 the initial temperature of the food product, A is the surface area of the food product, whereas ΔT is the temperature difference between the surface temperature of the refrigerant and the initial temperature of the food product.
Once the thermal conductivity of the food item is determined, the freezing time formula can be calculated using the following equation:
t = (m × Cp × ΔT) / (h × A × K) x Ln (Tf - T0 / Ti - T0)
where t is the time required to freeze a food product, m is the mass of the food item, Cp is the heat capacity of the food product, ΔT is the temperature difference between the initial temperature of the food product and the desired final temperature, h is the film coefficient of the food product's surface area, A the food product's surface area, K is the thermal conductivity of the food item while Ln is the natural logarithm. 
Conclusion:
Freezing food products is a scientific process that follows the fundamental principles of thermodynamics, heat transfer and phase transition. Numerous refrigeration systems are used in the food and beverage industry to deliver various cooling effects and temperature ranges. Effective freezing requires an understanding of the basic principles underlying the freezing process. Prior to refrigeration, preliminary processes are carried out to minimize the damages caused by freezing. The freezing time for a particular type of freezer depends on specific equations and calculations based on thermal conductivity. Careful consideration and adherence to the recommended process for their use can ensure the safety of food products, reduce waste and prolong their shelf-life.
