Derek Parfit's "Personal Identity" is a seminal work in the field of philosophy of personal identity. In it, Parfit presents a thought experiment in which a person's brain is split into two identical samples, and the question is raised as to which of the resulting individuals is the "real" or "original" person. This is known as the fission-example, and it has generated much debate and discussion among philosophers. In this essay, I will assess this example and explore its weaknesses in relation to reductionist views of personal identity.
Parfit's fission-example goes as follows: imagine that a person's brain is split into two equal samples, and each sample is then placed in a new, identical body. The resulting two individuals, A and B, are physically and psychologically identical to each other and the original person before the fission. The question then arises: which of these individuals is the "real" or "original" person? Some may believe that A is the original, as he or she has the same physical body and memories as the person before the fission. Others may argue that B is the original, as he or she has the same psychological continuity with the person before the fission.
Parfit uses this example to argue against the idea of personal identity being a matter of having a persisting soul or self. In other words, he is arguing against the view that what makes a person the same individual over time is some immaterial essence that transcends physical and psychological changes. Instead, he proposes that personal identity is a matter of psychological continuity and connectedness between different moments in time. In the fission-example, both A and B are equally "real" or "original" because they both have the same psychological continuity with the person before the fission.
However, Parfit's fission-example has been criticized for its underlying assumptions and its implications for reductionist views of personal identity. One criticism is that the example relies on a highly unlikely scenario that is physically impossible to replicate in the real world. While it is conceivable to imagine a person's brain being split into two identical samples, the idea that these samples could be placed in new, identical bodies is far-fetched. Furthermore, the example assumes that the resulting individuals will be physically and psychologically identical to each other and the original person before the fission. This assumes that personal identity is reducible to physical and psychological properties, which is an assumption that reductionists would accept but non-reductionists would not.
Another criticism of the fission-example is that it assumes that personal identity is a binary concept - that is, either A or B must be the "real" or "original" person. This assumption ignores the possibility that personal identity may be a matter of degree or degree of similarity rather than a yes-or-no question. For example, it may be possible to argue that A and B are both "real" or "original" to some extent, but that one is more closely connected to the person before the fission than the other.
The fission-example also raises questions about the nature of psychological continuity that Parfit relies on. Parfit defines psychological continuity as "a sequence of overlapping chains of strong connectedness," and argues that this is what constitutes personal identity. However, it is unclear how a person's psychological continuity is to be objectively measured or quantified. If personal identity is a matter of psychological continuity, how is it possible to determine the degree or strength of this continuity? This is a problem for reductionist views of personal identity, as it raises doubts about whether personal identity can be reduced to measurable physical or psychological properties.
Finally, the fission-example has been criticized for its implications for reductionist views of personal identity. Reductionists argue that personal identity is reducible to physical and psychological properties, and that there is no need to posit an immaterial soul or self. However, the fission-example assumes that personal identity is a matter of psychological continuity and connectedness, which is not easily reducible to physical or psychological properties. This raises the question of whether reductionism can provide a satisfactory account of personal identity, or whether some other non-reductive account is needed.
In conclusion, Derek Parfit's fission-example is a thought-provoking and influential example in the field of philosophy of personal identity. However, it has several weaknesses when examined in relation to reductionist views of personal identity. The example relies on unlikely assumptions and oversimplifies the concept of personal identity, reducing it to a binary question of who is the "real" or "original" person. It also raises questions about the nature of psychological continuity and its measurability, which is problematic for reductionist views of personal identity. Ultimately, the fission-example serves as a reminder of the complexity and subtlety of the concept of personal identity, and the need to explore it from multiple perspectives and through different philosophical approaches.
