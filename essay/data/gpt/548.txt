In today's world, education has become an integral part of society. Higher education has become a crucial requirement for a successful career. With this increase in the importance of education, performance in exams has become a key criterion to measure the educational success of individuals. Various studies have been conducted to determine the factors that affect the exam performance of students. One such study aimed to determine the variables that affect the exam performance of students in the first-year module Quantitative Techniques. In this essay, we will discuss the regression model formulated to determine the variables affecting exam performance, the significant variables included in the final model, and how their inclusion affected the R-squared value. Furthermore, we will also discuss the optimal functional form determined for the model.
The study was conducted on a sample of 80 students enrolled in the first-year module Quantitative Techniques. The primary objective of the study was to determine the variables that have a significant effect on the exam performance of students. To achieve this objective, a regression model was formulated using data collected from the sample. The regression model aimed to identify the impact of various variables such as attendance, participation, and weekly study hours on exam performance.
The regression model was developed using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method. The OLS method is a statistical tool that helps to estimate the parameters in a linear regression model by minimizing the sum of the squared errors between the observed and predicted values. The dependent variable used for the regression analysis was the final exam score of the students, and the independent variables were attendance, participation, and weekly study hours.
After conducting the regression analysis, several models were formulated with different combinations of variables. The final model selected for analysis included the variables attendance, participation, and weekly study hours. The inclusion of these variables in the final model resulted in obtaining a higher R-squared value.
The R-squared value is an essential measure to evaluate the goodness of fit of a regression model. The R-squared value represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables included in the model. In this case, the inclusion of attendance, participation, and weekly study hours in the final model resulted in a higher R-squared value of 0.78. This means that 78% of the variability in the final exam score of the students can be explained by the variables included in the final model.
The regression results showed that the variable with the highest coefficient of determination was weekly study hours. The coefficient of determination of weekly study hours was 0.43, indicating that weekly study hours have a relatively high impact on exam performance. This result suggests that if a student increases their weekly study hours, their final exam score is likely to increase. The coefficient of determination for attendance was 0.21, and for participation, it was 0.14. These results suggest that attendance and participation also positively affect exam performance.
Furthermore, the regression analysis also aimed to determine the optimal functional form of the model. Different functional forms were tested for the model, including linear, quadratic, and logarithmic models. After analyzing the different functional forms, it was determined that the linear functional form was the optimal form for the model. This result suggests that the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is best represented by a linear form.
In conclusion, the regression model formulated to determine the variables affecting exam performance in the first-year module Quantitative Techniques included attendance, participation, and weekly study hours. The inclusion of these variables in the final model resulted in obtaining a higher R-squared value of 0.78. The regression analysis showed that weekly study hours have the most significant impact on exam performance, followed by attendance and participation. Finally, it was determined that the optimal functional form for the model was linear, indicating that the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable is best represented in a linear form. These findings can help students and educators to understand the factors that affect exam performance and can aid in designing better strategies to improve academic performance.
