May 1968 marks an important moment in the history of France because it witnessed unprecedented mass protests, which managed to create an escalation in political and social unrest. Student-led strikes and protest movements emerged, joined by factory workers, teachers, and other oppressed social categories. These events had far-reaching implications for French society, particularly for the role of women in public life, politics, and culture. The connection between the events of May 1968 and the emergence of a new type of feminism in France was not immediate but gradual, as new forms of social activism enabled women to voice their grievances and critique the pervasive misogyny of French society. This essay will explore how, through women's participation in the May 1968 protests and the feminist movements that followed, a new type of feminism emerged in France, which had significant impacts on society and literature. It will also examine the role of women in May 1968 with specific reference to Marie Cardinal's book, The Words to Say It, which provides a first-hand account of a woman's struggle to assert her independence in a male-dominated society.
The events of May 1968 can be understood as a broad-based response to the social and political problems created by Charles de Gaulle's regime, which was seen as increasingly authoritarian and out-of-touch with the needs and aspirations of the French people. The student protests that kicked off the unrest were initially concerned with education reform and were joined by various groups, including factory workers who went on strike, and intellectuals who joined the student activists in denouncing the oppressive nature of the government and its neglect of civil liberties. Women were not absent from these protests, and several of them played prominent roles in the demonstrations. The presence of women in the May 1968 protests was significant because it challenged the traditional gender roles that had relegated women to the private sphere. Women's participation in these protests suggested that they had aspirations beyond the domestic, and they were willing to fight for their rights and freedom.
The feminist movements that emerged after May 1968 were shaped by a desire to challenge the gender hierarchy that had long existed in France. Women were eager to assert their independence and claim their right to participate in politics and public life. The shift towards radical feminism was marked by a critique of the patriarchy and an insistence on the need to create a society where women had equal access to power and resources. French feminist movements of the 1970s were characterized by a focus on reproductive rights, equal pay, and the representation of women in positions of power.
The impact of these feminist movements was extensive. Women began to enter previously male-focused professions such as politics, law, and the media, heralding a new era of gender equality. In 1999, France passed the parity law, requiring political parties to nominate an equal number of male and female candidates in regional and municipal elections. The law has had a significant impact on the representation of women in politics. It has enabled many women to enter politics, and the proportion of women in elected positions has increased steadily since the law was passed. For instance, in the 2017 French legislative elections, 40% of the elected MPs were women. The feminist movements also challenged cultural norms surrounding gender roles and sexuality. The debates that emerged around abortion, contraception, and homosexuality enabled women to claim their right to make decisions about their bodies and express their sexuality without fear of judgment or discrimination. These developments had significant implications for literature.
Feminist literature in France during the 1970s was marked by a frank engagement with female sexuality and a willingness to explore topics that had previously been taboo. The French Women's Liberation Movement advocated for women's right to control their own bodies and to express their sexuality freely, without being judged or socially ostracized. These debates are reflected in literary works such as Monique Wittig's The Lesbian Body, published in 1973. Wittig's book explores themes of lesbianism, female sexuality, and the disintegration of traditional gender roles. Her work challenged the fundamental assumptions of French literature, which had long privileged male perspectives and narratives.
Marie Cardinal's The Words to Say It is a first-person narrative that tells the story of a woman's journey of self-discovery and empowerment. The book is a frank exploration of Cardinal's struggles to break free from the psychological shackles imposed on her by French society. The story traces Cardinal's early life, which was marked by abuse and trauma, and her subsequent struggles to overcome the psychological effects of these experiences. In telling her story, Cardinal highlights the pervasive institutional structures that work to keep women oppressed. She emphasizes the importance of feminist solidarity and provides valuable insights into the psychological and emotional complexities of being a woman in a male-dominated society.
The Words to Say It provides an important critique of French society and its attitudes towards women. It exposes the ways in which the experience of womanhood is shaped by social structures that are inherently oppressive. Cardinal's book shows how these structures work to deny women their agency and subjectivity. The book is also a powerful testament to the transformative potential of feminist activism, as Cardinal's journey of personal liberation is inseparable from her involvement in feminist politics.
In conclusion, the events of May 1968 marked the beginning of a new wave of feminist activism in France. Women's participation in these protests enabled them to challenge traditional gender roles and to assert their rights and freedoms as individuals. The subsequent feminist movements transformed French society, enabling women to enter previously male-dominated professions and to challenge cultural norms surrounding gender roles and sexuality. These changes had a significant impact on literature, opening up new possibilities for the representation of women's experiences. The Words to Say It by Marie Cardinal provides an important critique of French society and its attitudes towards women. The book highlights the complex ways in which institutional structures work to keep women oppressed, while also emphasizing the transformative potential of feminist activism.
