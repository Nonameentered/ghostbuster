Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious problem that poses a significant threat to the safety of all road users. As the world develops and the use of drugs becomes more prevalent, it is becoming increasingly critical to identify drivers who may be impaired as a result of drug use. In recent years, Standardised Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) and Drug Recognition Examinations (DRE) are becoming more widely used to identify and evaluate drivers who are suspected of drug use. This essay aims to explore the Standardised Field Sobriety Tests and Drug Recognition Examinations, how police officers use these tests to determine if a motorist is impaired due to drug use, testing a motorist's blood for the presence of drugs, and how the presence of drugs in a motorist's blood affects their penalties if convicted of driving whilst unfit through drink or drugs.
Standardised Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) was introduced in the 1970s and is used to determine whether a driver is under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The tests involve a process where the officer conducting the tests will ask the driver to perform a series of physical and cognitive tasks, some of which include the walk and turn test, the one-leg stand test, and horizontal gaze nystagmus test. The walk and turn test requires the driver to take nine steps along a line, turn, and return in the opposite direction while maintaining balance. The one-leg stand test requires the driver to stand on one leg and count for thirty seconds. The horizontal gaze nystagmus test requires the driver to follow a stimulus, typically a pen light, with their eyes while the officer evaluates the drivers' eye movements and balance.
The drug recognition examination (DRE) is a more complex test that is used by specifically trained officers to evaluate a driver who is suspected of being under the influence of drugs. The DRE typically uses a twelve-step process to detect the presence of drugs. These steps include a breath test, interview, eye examination, divided attention tests, vital signs, dark room examination, muscle tone, injection sites assessment, toxicology test, urine test, and opinion formulation. The DRE aims to detect and assess the effects of drugs such as cannabis, opioids, cocaine, and stimulants.
Police officers use these tests to determine if a motorist is impaired due to drug use in several ways. When stopping a motorist, the first step is to determine if the motorist's behavior or appearance indicates impairment. The officer will then ask the motorist to step out of the vehicle and perform the SFST or DRE tests. These tests are designed to provide police officers with objective evidence of impairment that can be used in court to prove that the motorist was driving under the influence. If the motorist fails the SFST or DRE tests, the officer will usually arrest the motorist and take them to the police station for further testing and to obtain a blood test.
The process of testing a motorist's blood for the presence of drugs starts with obtaining a blood sample from the motorist. The officer who took the sample will then send the sample to a forensic laboratory, where the laboratory technicians will perform an analysis of the sample. The analysis will typically involve screening the blood sample using a Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS) method. The GCMS screening test will identify the presence of different drugs in the blood.
The accuracy of screening tests for drugs in a motorist's blood is not absolute. Some factors can impact the accuracy of the tests, including the type of drug, duration of use, and the sensitivity of the test itself. According to a study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), testing for drugs in blood can result in false positives. Also, some drugs may not remain in a person's blood for an extended period, making detection difficult.
When a motorist is convicted of driving whilst unfit through drink or drugs, there are several penalties they may face. The penalties will depend on the severity of the offense, but the presence of drugs in a motorist's blood generally has a significant impact on penalties. If drugs are detected in the blood, the motorist may face more severe penalties than if only alcohol was detected. Penalties may include a driving ban, fines, and potentially a prison sentence.
In conclusion, the Standardised Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) and Drug Recognition Examinations (DRE) are essential tools used by police officers to identify and evaluate drivers who are suspected of drug use. These tests provide objective evidence of impairment that can be used in court to prove that the motorist was driving under the influence. Blood tests are essential in detecting the presence of drugs in a motorist's blood, but the accuracy of screening tests is not absolute. When convicted of driving whilst unfit through drink or drugs, penalties may be severe and can depend on the presence of drugs in the motorist's blood. It is crucial to ensure that proper measures are taken to prevent drug-impaired driving as it poses a significant threat to the safety of all road users.
