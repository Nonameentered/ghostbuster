Saccharomyces cerevisiae, commonly known as Baker's yeast, is a popular experimental organism used in research. Among the many investigations it is currently being used for, one of the prominent ones is the study of protein interactions involved in the regulation of gene expression. Researchers use specific proteins and techniques to carry out this experiment.
The objective of this study is to understand the various proteins that interact in the process of gene regulation and the mode of their interactions. The proteins involved include transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, and cofactors, among others. These proteins work together in a precise manner to enable the accurate expression of genes. Any errors in their interactions can lead to adverse effects, such as diseases or developmental abnormalities.
The first step in the experiment is the preparation of the yeast strains. Researchers use genetic modifications to create strains that express specific proteins of interest, such as transcription factors or chromatin remodelers. This genetic modification helps to investigate the interaction between these proteins.
The techniques used to determine the interactions between these proteins are referred to as co-immunoprecipitation, or co-IP. In this technique, Yeast strains that express the proteins of interest are grown and harvested. The yeast lysates are then incubated with antibodies that recognize the protein of interest. These antibodies help to pull out the protein, along with any other proteins that it interacts with. The resulting products from the incubation are then run on an SDS-PAGE gel. The protein bands are separated and seen through Western Blot. 
Through Western Blot, the researchers can determine which proteins interact with the protein of interest. If the protein of interest interacts with other proteins, the researchers know that their interaction is critical in the regulation of gene expression.
The other technique used in the study is known as yeast two-hybrid assay. In this assay, two yeast strains are prepared: one with a bait protein fused to a DNA-binding domain, and the other with a prey protein fused to a transactivation domain. If the bait protein interacts with the prey protein, the transcription of a reporter gene is activated, indicating their interaction.
The investigation using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an experimental organism focuses on understanding the proteins that regulate gene expression. Researchers use specific proteins such as transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, and cofactors. They also apply techniques such as co-immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid assay to determine the mode of protein interactions. Understanding these proteins' interactions and the regulation of gene expression is crucial in developing drugs for various diseases. Hence the importance of the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in this experiment.
