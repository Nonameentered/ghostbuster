The light rail industry has emerged as a key component of modern transport systems, with many cities worldwide investing in light rail infrastructure to enhance the mobility of their residents. This industry involves the use of tramways, light rail vehicles or streetcars that run on dedicated tracks, and that are usually powered by an overhead wire. Despite the increasing demand for light rail services, there remain several barriers to entry for new firms looking to enter the market. This essay will explore the various obstacles to entry in the light rail industry, and how they impact the possibility of new firms entering the market. Additionally, this essay will examine whether acquisition would be a more attractive option than starting a new firm in the light rail industry, drawing from the case of the Midland Metro.
One of the main barriers to entry in the light rail industry is the substantial upfront investment required. Construction of light rail networks is a capital-intensive undertaking, and new firms must be prepared to invest heavily in the requisite infrastructure, including track, rolling stock, power and signalling systems, and stations. In addition, there are ongoing maintenance and operational costs that must be considered. For example, the UK's Midland Metro, which operates on a 21-kilometer track catering to over 7 million passengers annually, costs approximately Â£25 million per year to run. This means that new entrants to the industry need to have significant financial resources to cover these costs and generate sufficient revenues over time.
Another significant barrier to entry in the light rail industry is the regulatory environment. Transport networks such as light rail require licenses and permits from various authorities, including transport regulators, local councils, and planning bodies. Obtaining these approvals can be a complex, lengthy, and costly process, particularly for firms without established relationships with relevant authorities and stakeholders. This regulatory complexity discourages new firms from entering the market, as they may lack the necessary expertise and relationships required to navigate the regulatory environment effectively. Moreover, the regulatory environment can change rapidly and require new entrants to comply with more stringent regulations from the start to operate their services.
In addition, established firms may have established relationships with suppliers of key equipment and services, further limiting the entry of new firms into the market. This is because the development of light rail networks often requires the use of specialist equipment and services, including train carriages, signals, and control systems. Establishing relationships with these suppliers can provide an incumbent with a competitive advantage in terms of better prices, delivery schedules, and reliability. New entrants, on the other hand, may lack the bargaining power and industry knowledge to negotiate deals with these suppliers and secure more favorable terms.
The Midland Metro serves as an excellent example of these barriers to entry and their impact on the possibility of new entrants in the light rail industry. In this case, the development of the Midland Metro was spearheaded by the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (WMPTE), which later became Centro, the West Midlands Integrated Transport Authority. The creation of the network required significant upfront investment in track, rolling stock, and signaling systems. Being a public sector organization allowed Centro to raise the necessary capital, and as a result, the infrastructure has remained publicly owned throughout the network's development and operation.
The regulatory environment has also played a significant role in the Midland Metro's development and operation. Although the initial plans were agreed upon in 1985, the first line only opened in 1999, primarily due to the challenges posed by navigating the regulatory environment. For example, obtaining the necessary consents and permissions from various authorities took longer than anticipated, with some stakeholders opposing proposed routes. This experience highlights the complexity of the regulatory environment and the importance of building relationships with relevant authorities and stakeholders to ensure timely approval.
The Midland Metro's track record of successful operation means that it has strong relationships with its suppliers, making it challenging for new entrants. For example, the rolling stock supplier for the Midland Metro is CAF (Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles), a Spanish firm that has established a reputation as a reliable supplier of light rail vehicles. Although new entrants could approach CAF to purchase rolling stock worth several hundred million pounds, they would likely face a steeper price than Centro, given their lack of industry bargaining power.
Given the various barriers to entry in the light rail industry, acquisition may indeed be a more attractive option than starting a new firm. An acquisition allows a company to gain instant entry into the market by acquiring an established firm and its assets, including track, rolling stock, and other infrastructure. It also provides access to an existing customer base and relationships with relevant authorities and suppliers. As a result, acquiring an established light rail operator can overcome many of the obstacles confronting new entrants, such as regulatory hurdles and the need to invest in infrastructure from scratch.
Acquisition has already happened in the case of Midland Metro, where in 2017 the West Midlands Combined Authority, an amalgamated transport authority, acquired the network from Centro. This acquisition allows the West Midlands Combined Authority to operate and develop the network as it sees fit.
In conclusion, entry into the light rail industry is challenging due to the various barriers to entry, including substantial upfront investment requirements, regulatory complexity, and established supplier relationships. These barriers limit the possibility of new entrants and make acquisition a more attractive option for those seeking to gain entry into the market. In the case of Midland Metro, the public sector led the development of the network, while also navigating the regulatory environment and establishing relationships with suppliers, thus reinforcing the view of acquisition being a more attractive option than starting a new firm to enter the light rail industry.
