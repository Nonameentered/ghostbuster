Conservation research is an essential step towards preserving biodiversity. The four-step conservation research programme involves identifying species, assessing their population size and distribution, developing strategies to increase their numbers, and monitoring their progress. Genetic analysis plays a crucial role in step two by determining the genetic diversity of a species, which is essential for the development of effective conservation strategies. For example, genetic analysis of the African golden cat showed low genetic diversity, indicating a need for habitat protection and management. Genetic analysis of the Asian elephant revealed distinct populations, highlighting the need for conservation efforts specific to each population. Overall, genetic analysis provides crucial insights into the genetic health and uniqueness of a species, facilitating the development of effective conservation strategies.
