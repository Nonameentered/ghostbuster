Thiamine is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for normal growth and function of the human body. It is commonly found in many foods, including cornflakes. In spectrophotometry analysis, the fluorescence capability of thiamine can be used to determine its concentration in a sample. However, when comparing the practical value for the thiamine content in cornflakes to the literature value, it is common to obtain a lower practical value. This is due to various sources of error that can arise during the analysis, such as the structure of molecules affecting their fluorescence capability.
One possible source of error in the determination of thiamine concentration is the presence of interfering substances in the cornflake sample. These may include other vitamins, minerals or pigments that can affect the spectroscopic properties of thiamine, leading to inaccurate results. To minimize this error, it is important to use a suitable extraction method that only extracts thiamine and not other compounds. Additionally, certain components in the extraction solution such as sodium hydroxide can affect the fluorescent intensity of thiamine, leading to inaccurate readings.
Other sources of error can arise from instrumental factors such as wavelength selection, fluorescence detector sensitivity, and temperature control. Wavelength selection is particularly important since the excitation and emission wavelengths of thiamine overlap with those of other fluorescent compounds. Substances that emit fluorescence at the same wavelength as thiamine can interfere with the measurement, leading to false positives. Detector sensitivity is also important since the concentration of thiamine present in the sample may be very low, requiring a highly sensitive detector to accurately measure the fluorescence signal.
Another source of error in the determination of thiamine concentration is the choice of standard. Since the fluorescence intensity of thiamine can vary depending on the matrix of the sample, it is important to use a standard that closely resembles the sampleâ€™s matrix. Choosing a standard too dissimilar to the sample can lead to inaccuracies due to matrix effects.
The structure of molecules can also affect their fluorescence capability in spectrophotometry analysis. For example, the presence of certain functional groups can enhance or quench the fluorescence of a molecule. Thiamine is a nitrogen-containing compound, which has a highly fluorescent structure. The fluorescent behavior of a molecule is largely determined by the presence of chromophores, which are groups of atoms in the molecule that absorb light and cause it to fluoresce. In thiamine, the chromophore responsible for fluorescence is the pyrimidine ring, which absorbs ultraviolet light.
In addition to the chromophore, the fluorescent behavior of thiamine is also influenced by the solvent environment. The fluorescence properties of a molecule can differ depending on the polarity or viscosity of the solvent. Since thiamine is a water-soluble molecule, it is usually dissolved in an aqueous solvent. The presence of other compounds in the solvent can also affect the fluorescence intensity of thiamine. For example, if the solvent contains a molecule that is capable of quenching thiamine fluorescence, the spectrophotometry measurement will be inaccurate.
To conclude, the determination of thiamine concentration in cornflakes is subject to various sources of error that can lead to lower practical values than the literature values. Some of these errors arise from instrumental factors such as wavelength selection, fluorescence detector sensitivity, and temperature control. The choice of standard is also important to ensure accurate measurements. Additionally, the structure of molecules can affect their fluorescence capability in spectrophotometry analysis. Thiamine's fluorescent behavior is largely determined by the presence of a chromophore, which can be influenced by the solvent environment. Inaccurate readings can result from fluctuations in solvent polarity or the presence of interfering compounds. By taking into account these sources of error, more accurate measurements of thiamine concentration can be obtained in cornflakes and other food samples.
