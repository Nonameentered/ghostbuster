Systematic Systems Methodology, commonly known as SSM, is a systems thinking and problem-solving approach developed by Peter Checkland in the 1970s. It is a qualitative approach that seeks to understand complex and messy real-world situations and identify the root causes of problems. SSM is unique in that it is focused on the social dimensions of complex systems; it assumes that all systems are socially constructed and emphasizes the importance of understanding the values, norms, and power structures that underpin them.
There are two streams of inquiry in mode 2 of SSM - the interventionist stream and the cultural stream. The interventionist stream is focused on designing solutions to problems within systems, while the cultural stream is focused on understanding the cultural norms and values that underpin systems. The two streams differ in their approaches - the interventionist stream takes an objective approach to problem-solving, while the cultural stream takes a more subjective approach.
The cultural stream of SSM is focused on understanding social systems, norms, and values. It seeks to identify the underlying cultural assumptions and values that shape systems and the way people interact with them. This stream is important because it recognizes that culture is an essential component of systems, and understanding cultural norms and values is critical to understanding the social structures that underpin them. By analyzing culture, SSM practitioners can identify the barriers to change within systems and design interventions that are more likely to be successful.
SSM's focus on understanding culture also extends to identifying power structures within systems. The methodology assumes that power is a critical component of complex systems, and understanding power structures is necessary to design effective interventions. This recognition of power dynamics is important because it highlights the need to design interventions that address the underlying power structures within systems to create more equitable outcomes.
In terms of its approach to systems engineering, SSM is quite different from other approaches. Traditional approaches to systems engineering are typically focused on designing technical solutions to technical problems. SSM, on the other hand, recognizes that systems are complex and interconnected, and that technical solutions alone may not be sufficient to solve problems. It takes a holistic approach, acknowledging the social and cultural dimensions of systems and seeking to understand them before designing interventions.
However, while SSM is a powerful methodology for understanding complex systems, it does have some potential drawbacks and limitations. One of the main limitations is that it can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Analyzing cultural norms and values requires a significant amount of time and effort, and the process of designing interventions that address these cultural factors can be challenging. Additionally, SSM can be criticized for being too subjective, as it relies heavily on the perspectives and experiences of those involved in the system. This subjectivity can lead to a lack of objectivity in the analysis of systems, potentially leading to imprecise or incomplete solutions.
Despite these limitations, SSM remains a powerful and important tool for understanding complex systems. Its recognition of cultural norms and values, power dynamics, and the social dimensions of systems make it a unique and valuable approach to systems engineering. By addressing the underlying cultural assumptions and power structures within systems, SSM can design interventions that are more likely to be successful in creating sustainable and equitable outcomes.
