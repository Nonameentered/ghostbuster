Realism, as an artistic style, is focused on creating an accurate representation of reality through creative work. It has been a dominant perspective in theatre and other arts, particularly in the modernist era. However, its appropriateness as a tool for conveying political messages has been questioned. In this essay, the limitations of Realism as a form of artistic presentation in theatre, particularly for political playwrights and theatre groups, will be discussed, with a focus on Sarah Kane's play, Blasted, and Theatre Workshop's production of Oh! What a Lovely War.
Realism, as an approach, attempts to depict the world as it is, with minimal manipulation or imagination. In literature, the Realist writers aimed to write about real people, in real time, in often mundane and frequently sad situations. This approach was incorporated into the theatre genre, and it became prominent in the 20th century. Realism in theatre was characterized by the use of ordinary language, everyday settings, and an emphasis on psychological realism. However, the limitations of Realism as an artistic tool have made it difficult for political playwrights and theatre groups to use this approach effectively.
One of these limitations is that Realism can be too descriptive, which means that it may not reflect reality. Even with the use of mundane and supposedly ordinary activities, theatre can never recreate reality completely. Re-creating the world exactly as it is would require much more than just actors and scenery. This point was illustrated in Sarah Kane's play, Blasted. Blasted is a play that is considered highly subversive to Realism, and one that drew intense criticism upon its release. The play deals with issues of war, gender, and violence, and sought to realign the ideas of the audience. Its primary focus is on a journalist, Ian, who brings a young woman, Cate, to his hotel room, only to be interrupted by a brutal soldier who eventually rapes and viciously assaults them. 
Kane's play is a powerful and disturbing critique of Realism's romanticization of war. The play portrays a scene where the soldier rapes Cate, which is alienating and challenging. This depiction is meant to make the viewer question and confront the act of violence being portrayed. Kane's subverted approach to Realism reflects the limitations of the genre when it comes to dealing with complex, often painful, and controversial issues. Kane's use of the rape scene highlights the ugly and brutal nature of sexual violence in war and its impact on individual women. Realism as an art form is unable to capture the full reality or the gravity of this situation. Kane's artistic approach to the subject helps the audience connect with the harsh realities of violence. Therefore, Realism proves inadequate in fully conveying the violent and distressing occurrences of the world.
Another critique of Realism's essential weaknesses is that the style is often devoid of clear political messages. Realism often emphasizes everyday life – and therefore may not be conducive to radical politics. Playwrights and theatre groups who are looking to advocate for change and to challenge existing power structures often find that Realism trivializes and normalizes political issues. In this context, political theatre becomes difficult, as the cultural and audience attention shifts towards a more "realistic" approach to the world.
The Theatre Workshop's production, Oh! What a Lovely War, is an excellent example of theatre moving away from Realism to make a political statement. The play is a British production that deals with the First World War. It is an unusual play, as it is an anti-war play that employs music, dance, and humor. It was first produced in 1963, using The Fit-Up Theatre Company's style that emphasized traveling around the UK, occupying various venues. The play does not keep to the traditional script format of Realist plays. Instead, it employs multimedia, music, and satire, making it difficult for any position of realism to be maintained. This choice proves appropriate for a play that critiques the horrors of war.
Theatre Workshop's production was essential in raising awareness of the world's position post-World War I. The play's anti-war message was sophisticated and nuanced, and the use of satire and humor helped to capture the audience's attention and provoke political action. The play's approach not only exposed the absurdity of war but also highlighted the political consequences of war. It showed how soldiers were pawns of the government, how egos had ruined the world and how propaganda machinery was an essential part of the warmongering. These political messages would not have been able to be effectively communicated, using a Realist approach.
In conclusion, Realism, as an artistic tool, allows for an illusion of "reality" that can often be inadequate in depicting political issues. Realism emphasizes banal, everyday happenings, and, therefore, political theatre that seeks to incite social change can be ill-suited to use this approach. Theatre Workshop's Oh! What a Lovely War and Sarah Kane's Blasted are both examples of theatre performances that subvert Realism's limitations to create engaging and politically challenging works. In Oh! What a Lovely War, the use of satire, music, and dance captures the audience's attention, and through the anti-war play, the political messages depict the absurdity and grave consequences of war. In contrast, Sarah Kane's Blasted brings up the harsh and painful realities of violence, through a subversion of Realism, that connects the audience to the truly disturbing and brutal nature of sexual violence. Therefore, the limitations of Realism reveal the importance of artistic innovation in creating meaningful theatre performances – be it for political, social, psychological, or any other purpose of the theatre.
