The Freddie Mac scandal, which surfaced in 2003, had a severe impact on the auditing profession, highlighting major issues and concerns regarding auditor independence, financial reporting, and credibility. The scandal showed a significant failure of the auditing profession to identify, report, and prevent accounting errors, manipulation, and fraud. In this essay, we will analyze the impact of the Freddie Mac scandal on the auditing profession and explore ways in which the profession can improve its credibility.
Freddie Mac, a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), is a prime example of the impact of financial reporting failures on stakeholders' trust. The company was created to provide liquidity for the housing and mortgage markets, and as such, had a significant impact on the country's economy. However, in 2003, a scandal erupted when the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) discovered widespread financial misstatements, accounting irregularities, and manipulation in Freddie Mac's financial statements. Investigations revealed that the company had understated its earnings by billions of dollars, violating Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations.
The Freddie Mac scandal revealed significant deficiencies in the auditing profession, particularly in terms of auditor independence and objectivity. The company's auditor at the time, Arthur Andersen, was found to have overlooked irregularities, manipulated audit findings, and failed to report to the company's audit committee. The SEC later found Andersen guilty of committing securities fraud and obstructing justice in its auditing of Freddie Mac, leading to the firm's downfall in 2002.
This scandal had a significant impact on the auditing profession's credibility, public confidence, and trust. It raised questions about the effectiveness of the auditing process, the independence of auditors, and the objectivity of audit reports. In light of this, the profession needs to take steps to restore its credibility and improve the quality of its services to stakeholders.
One of the steps that the auditing profession can take to improve its credibility is to enhance the regulatory framework that governs auditors and the accounting profession. The regulatory framework should be updated to reflect modern practices, standards, and guidelines, and regulators should have more powers to enforce compliance. Additionally, regulators should work closely with auditors to clarify rules and expectations, and promote better understanding of their roles and responsibilities. This could include conducting regular training, awareness-raising, and knowledge-sharing activities that increase auditor awareness of emerging issues and best practices.
Another key area that the profession should address is auditor independence. The Freddie Mac case showed that auditor independence is a crucial factor in the audit process. The profession needs to establish mechanisms that remove or reduce auditor conflicts of interest, such as incentives and relationships that may impact their objectivity. This can include measures such as limiting the number of non-audit services that auditors provide to their clients, increasing the rotation of audit partners, and establishing safeguards that promote transparency and accountability in the audit process.
The auditing profession can also improve the credibility of its services by promoting audit quality and enhancing the audit process's transparency. This can be achieved through robust monitoring, inspection, and reporting mechanisms that evaluate the quality of audit services provided by registered firms. Auditors should conduct comprehensive audits, exercise professional judgement, and communicate effectively with their clients, audit committees, regulators, and other stakeholders.
Moreover, the profession can strengthen public trust and confidence by adopting advanced technologies and digital auditing tools that promote efficiency and quality in the audit process. This includes implementing blockchain, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics, among others. These technologies can enhance audit quality, reduce human errors, promote data integrity, and make audit reports more meaningful and useful to stakeholders.
In conclusion, the Freddie Mac scandal had a significant impact on the auditing profession, raising questions about auditor independence, financial reporting, and credibility. The profession must take steps to restore its credibility and improve the quality of its services to stakeholders. This includes enhancing the regulatory framework, promoting auditor independence, promoting audit quality, and adopting advanced digital auditing tools. By taking these steps, the profession can rebuild public trust and confidence and meet the demands of a rapidly changing business environment.
