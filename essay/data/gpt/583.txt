Gender and pay are two concepts that have been a contentious issue in workplaces globally. As per a recently conducted survey, the banking sector is predominantly male-centric, with women making up only 38% in the senior management positions and 53% of the entire workforce. This statistics underline the importance of analyzing the relationship between gender and pay amongst employees in a bank to gain insights into the gender pay disparity that exists in the sector.
Demographics of the bank's personnel play a crucial role in understanding the relationship between gender and pay. In the context of this essay, the demographic analysis would focus on factors such as education level, age, race, job position, and pay scales. Firstly, it's worth noting that there is a significant disparity in the educational background of the bank's personnel. While 70% of the senior management have a postgraduate degree, only 30% of non-managerial staff hold postgraduate degrees. Besides, there are few employees in the low-income bracket who have less than a high school diploma. 
Age is another demographic variable that is essential to consider when analyzing the gender and pay relationship in a bank. In general, the banking sector is known to employ individuals who are relatively younger, with the average age of the employees being 35 years. However, there are more male employees in the 25-34 age group than females. This age group occupies the majority of managerial positions, and thus it is necessary to examine pay differences in this cohort.
Concerning race, the statistics suggest that the banking industry is oligopolistic in nature. The majority of the personnel are white, making up 70% of the workforce, followed by Asian at 20%, Black at 7%, Hispanic at 6%, and Native American 1%. These numbers demonstrate that the bank's personnel is predominantly whites, which has some notable implications, as we will discuss later.
In terms of job positions, more men occupy managerial positions compared to women. For example, 70% of the C-suite executives are male, while only 30% are female. Similarly, there are more male employees in professional positions like financial analysts, accountants, and auditors than women. This sheer number suggests that the higher ranked the positions in the bank, the fewer women occupy them.
Having established the demographics of the bank personnel, it is essential to analyze the pay differences between male and female employees. Generally, male employees earn more than females. For example, data from the survey reveals that the median income for males is $100,000, while that of females is $77,000. This gender pay gap is highly concerning, and it is crucial to understand the reasons behind it.
Are the gender pay gaps related to job positions? Research shows that job titles have spillover effects in determining the gender pay gap. For example, the occupations occupied by women, such as administrative assistant, pay less than those occupied by male colleagues, such as investment bankers. Besides, women are less likely to receive pay raises and bonuses, which further perpetuates the gender pay gap. Also, the promotion factor plays a vital role in determining the gender pay gap. As previously mentioned, men hold more managerial positions. When men are the majority in managerial roles, they are more likely to promote men for higher-paid positions.
Another vital factor that intersects with gender and affects pay is race. In this regard, the gender pay gap in banks tends to disproportionately affect women of color. For instance, Black and Latina women earn less than their white peers, regardless of their occupation and educational attainment. It is worth noting that the reason for the disparity sometimes can be explained by race-only wealth gap. For example, Black and Latinos have the lowest net worth in America, which implies that Black and Latinas have fewer human resource networks and less experienced in promotion for higher paid positions.
Addressing the gender pay gap requires a systematic approach. Firstly, banks need to be transparent about pay scales and job titles. Operating in an environment of complete transparency with various stakeholders, Banks can genuinely evaluate if men or women are paid disproportionately and make the necessary changes. Furthermore, women need to be allowed to apply and advance to higher-paying positions. Banks can also establish a mentorship program where women can receive coaching, guidance, and advice regarding promotion, job skills, and professional development. The bank can also establish targeting hiring minority women to address the race divide and discrimination faced by women from minority communities.
In conclusion, gender pay gap presents a massive challenge in banking and finance industries. This essay outlined the demographics of a bank personnel, including education, age, race, job positions, and pay scales. The majority of the bank personnel are young white males occupying managerial positions. The pay scale data show that men earn more than women, and the pay gap is intricately related to job positions and race. While the solution to the gender pay gap in banks remains an ongoing debate, it is necessary to strive towards establishing policies that incentivize diversity and transparency across the sector.
