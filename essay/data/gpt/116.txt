Domestic solar collector water heating system is the new form of technology that utilizes renewable energy to heat water for domestic purposes. In London, this system has gained popularity over recent years due to the city's active commitment to environmental protection. The system uses solar collectors that capture sunlight and transfer it to the water in storage tanks. 
The performance assessment of a domestic solar collector water heating system in London is vital in determining its viability compared to other traditional water heating systems. The assessment can be made based on the system's efficiency in converting solar energy to heat, the amount of hot water produced, cost savings, and environmental impact. 
The performance of a solar collector water heating system varies throughout the year depending on weather patterns, solar insolation, and the system's design. In London, the system's performance is high during the summer months when there is an abundance of sunlight. During the winter months, the system's performance is low as there is less sunlight. 
To illustrate the performance of solar collector water heating systems in London, a study was conducted by the National Energy Foundation (NEF) in collaboration with the Energy Saving Trust (EST). The study revealed that the system's efficiency in capturing solar energy ranges between 70%-90%. The system's ability to convert solar energy to heat depends on various factors such as the orientation of the solar collectors, the angle of inclination, and the materials used for construction. 
In terms of hot water production, the study showed that a solar collector water heating system can produce between 50%-70% of the annual domestic hot water requirement. This is considerably high, considering that the system only utilizes the energy from the sun. Furthermore, the system's performance can be optimized by using backup electric or gas systems to supplement hot water production during periods of low solar energy. 
Regarding cost savings, a solar collector water heating system in London can save between £90-£200 per year depending on the hot water demand and the system's design. The cost savings result from reduced use of electricity or gas to heat water. The cost savings can also be increased by utilizing a larger solar water heating system, which can meet more significant hot water demands. 
In comparison to electric and gas systems, a solar collector water heating system is considerably cheaper in the long run. While the initial installation cost of a solar collector water heating system is high, the system has a longer lifespan than electric and gas systems. Additionally, the cost of electricity and gas continues to increase, whereas the cost of maintaining a solar collector water heating system is considerably low as it only requires routine maintenance. 
Electric and gas water heating systems have a constant supply of energy, and their performance is not affected by weather patterns. However, these systems have a higher cost of operation and maintenance in the long run. Additionally, electric and gas systems contribute to carbon emissions, whereas solar collector water heating systems have negligible environmental impact. 
In conclusion, the performance assessment of a domestic solar collector water heating system in London is vital in determining its viability compared to other traditional water heating systems. The system's performance varies throughout the year, depending on weather patterns and the design of the solar collectors. The system's efficiency in converting solar energy to heat ranges between 70%-90%, and hot water production can meet between 50%-70% of the annual domestic hot water requirement. The system is cost-effective in the long run as it saves between £90-£200 per year compared to electric and gas systems. Electric and gas water heating systems have a constant energy supply, but their cost of operation and maintenance is considerably high in the long run. Additionally, electric and gas systems contribute to carbon emissions, whereas solar collector water heating systems have negligible environmental impact. Therefore, a solar collector water heating system is the most viable option for London households due to its efficiency, cost savings, and environmental impact.
