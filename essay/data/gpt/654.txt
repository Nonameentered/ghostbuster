The judiciary is meant to be impartial, and decisions should be reached purely on the basis of the facts presented in each case. However, many factors can affect impartiality and lead to bias. In this essay, I will explore the facets of bias that may affect the judiciary and how the law on bias as a ground for judicial review stands today. I will use an Employment Tribunal case as an example to discuss the importance of judicial impartiality, the reasons for establishing grounds for disqualification of a judge, and the dangers of expanding the grounds of appeal to social background. Finally, as the legal advisor to the affected party in the case, I will suggest the action that should be taken.
There are different types of bias that may affect the judiciary. The first type is personal bias, which occurs when a judge holds a strong personal view on an issue relevant to the case. For example, in a sexual harassment case, a judge who believes that men and women should not work together may struggle to be impartial when assessing the evidence. The second type is institutional bias, which arises when the judges or the court system have a bias against certain groups or classes of people. An example is the bias faced by racial minorities and those belonging to lower social classes, who may be perceived as being less credible or reliable in court. The third type is structural bias, which stems from the way the legal system is set up and operates. For instance, judges may have prejudices against the type of litigants who appear before them, such as employees bringing discrimination claims against their employers.
Given that bias can distort justice, it is crucial to maintain judicial impartiality. A judge who is biased cannot render justice because he or she will not decide in good faith. Therefore, the law provides for the disqualification of judges under certain circumstances. For instance, a judge may be disqualified if he or she has an interest in the case or has previously acted as a lawyer for one of the parties. However, grounds for disqualification are limited and cannot cover all forms of bias. For example, personal biases that are not based on an interest in the case cannot be grounds for disqualification. This is a weakness in the law, as personal biases can be as harmful as those based on interest.
Expanding the grounds of appeal to social background is also dangerous. The legal system serves to promote equality and protect individuals' rights, but it must not take into account factors such as social background. Doing so could lead to blatantly inappropriate outcomes, such as offering more leniency to those from higher social backgrounds, and this is unjust. Instead, the courts should be focused solely on the facts presented in the case.
As far as the case of the Employment Tribunal goes, the importance of impartiality cannot be overstated. The case involves a dispute between an employer and an employee who were in conflict over the terms of the employee's work. The employer accused the employee of being uncooperative, while the employee alleged that he had been the subject of racially motivated discrimination.
As the legal advisor to the affected party, I would advise against appealing on the basis of social background because it is not a relevant factor in the case. Instead, I would first look at whether the judge has any personal biases or conflicts of interest in the case. If the judge has expressed any views or opinions that suggest a lack of impartiality, I would seek to have them disqualified from the case.
However, it is not always easy to prove bias. Sometimes, it may be based on unconscious biases that are difficult to identify. In such cases, I would explore options for an alternative dispute resolution. For example, we may consider pursuing mediation or negotiation which could lead to a resolution that is satisfactory to both parties. This would avoid the need for the tribunal and potentially reduce the risk of bias.
In conclusion, bias is a major problem in the judiciary that can lead to improper and unjust outcomes. The law recognizes only limited grounds for disqualification of judges, and it is dangerous to expand the grounds of appeal to social background. Therefore, the focus must be on maintaining judicial impartiality and ensuring that judges are unbiased and free from conflicts of interest in all cases. As the legal advisor to the affected party, the best course of action is to explore all potential avenues for resolution while remaining vigilant and ever-watchful for signs of bias. Ultimately, ensuring a fair hearing and outcome for the client should be the top priority.
