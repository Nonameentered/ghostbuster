Introduction
Service encounters involve employees having interactions with customers, and there is a growing interest in how employees manage their emotions during these encounters, also known as emotional labour. National culture can significantly influence the ease with which employees perform their emotional labour in service encounters, as different cultures have varying norms and expectations regarding emotional expression and management. The aim of this essay is to explore how national culture influences the emotional labour of employees and service quality in Disney theme parks in the United States and France.
Emotional Labour in Service Encounters
Emotional labour refers to the management of emotions by employees in service encounters to create and maintain an appropriate emotional atmosphere that aligns with the expectations of the organization's customers (Hochschild, 1983). Some forms of emotional labour are surface acting, where employees alter their displayed emotions without actual change in their inner emotions, and deep acting, where workers regulate inner emotions to match the expected emotional expression (Ashforth and Humphrey, 1993).
Emotional labour in service encounters can result in either positive or negative service outcomes and can significantly influence customer satisfaction and loyalty (Solomon and Rabinovich Einy, 2007). Inconsistencies between emotional labour and customer expectations can result in negative service encounters, where employees can either experience burnout or disengage from their work (Zhang, Huang, and Khoo-Lattimore, 2020).
Impact of National Culture on Emotional Labour
National culture can influence the ease with which employees perform emotional labour in service encounters, as different cultures have varying norms and expectations concerning emotional expression and management. Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory, which describes six cultural dimensions, can help to explain the impact of national culture on emotional labour in service encounters.
One of the cultural dimensions is power distance, and it refers to the extent to which individuals in a culture expect the distribution of power to be unequal (Hofstede, 2011). In high power distance cultures, employees are more likely to perform emotional labour without questioning the motives of their superiors. In contrast, low power distance cultures are likely to view explicit emotional displays as dishonest and insincere (Gudykunst, Ting-Toomey, and Nishida, 1996). The cultural dimension of individualism versus collectivism also impacts emotional labour, with individualistic cultures emphasizing personal goals and self-expression, while collectivistic cultures prioritize group harmony (Triandis, 1995). Thus, in collectivist cultures, employees are more likely to be concerned about maintaining group harmony over individual emotions and may suppress personal emotions. In individualistic cultures, employees may voice their emotions more openly.
Another cultural dimension is uncertainty avoidance, and it refers to the extent to which individuals in a culture feel threatened by ambiguity and uncertainty (Hofstede, 2011). In cultures with high uncertainty avoidance, employees are likely to use more explicit emotional displays to reduce the uncertainty in service encounters. In contrast, in cultures with low uncertainty avoidance, employees might use less explicit emotional displays.
Disney Theme Parks in the United States and France
Disney theme parks provide an interesting context to explore the impact of national culture on emotional labour, as Disney operates in different countries worldwide, including the United States and France. These two countries have varying cultural values, which may influence how employees perform their emotional labour and service quality.
The United States is an individualistic and low power distance culture, whereas France is a collectivistic and high power distance culture (Hofstede, 2011). Thus, it is expected that American employees in Disney theme parks will prioritize personal goals and self-expression over group harmony and may voice their emotions more openly. In contrast, French employees may be more concerned about maintaining group harmony over individual emotions and may suppress their personal emotions.
Impact of National Culture on Emotional Labour in Disney Theme Parks in the United States and France
A study conducted by Holmqvist and Strandvik (2017) explored the impact of national culture on emotional labour in Disney theme parks in the United States and France. The study found that employees in both countries exhibited similar emotional displays, but the extent to which they used explicit emotional displays differed, and this was influenced by national culture.
American employees were more likely to use explicit emotional displays, such as smiling, making eye contact, and expressing positive emotions, to enhance the customer experience. This is consistent with the individualistic culture where employees prioritize personal goals and self-expression over group harmony (Holmqvist and Strandvik, 2017). Also, American employees were found to engage more with customers and provide more personalized service, which resulted in higher levels of customer satisfaction.
In contrast, French employees were found to use more implicit emotional displays, such as maintaining neutral facial expressions and being less vocal in expressing emotions. This is consistent with the collectivistic culture, where employees are more likely to be concerned about maintaining group harmony over individual emotions (Holmqvist and Strandvik, 2017). However, French employees were found to be more instrumental in their service delivery, using more standardized language and conducting themselves in a more professional manner. While French employees' service delivery may appear less personalized, this approach was positively perceived by customers (Holmqvist and Strandvik, 2017).
Impact of National Culture on Service Quality in Disney Theme Parks in the United States and France
National culture can also impact service quality in Disney theme parks. In the United States, American employees' use of explicit emotional displays, personalized service, and engagement with customers results in higher levels of customer satisfaction, contributing positively to the overall service quality. In contrast, in France, employees' use of implicit emotional displays, standardized language, and professionalism contributes positively to the overall service quality.
Moreover, the study by Holmqvist and Strandvik (2017) found that American and French customers had different expectations regarding service quality. American customers expected highly personalized service that reflected the individualistic culture, while French customers expected more instrumental service that reflected the collectivistic culture.
Conclusion
National culture can significantly influence the ease with which employees perform emotional labour in service encounters. In Disney theme parks in the United States and France, cultural differences affected how employees perform their emotional labour and how customers perceive service quality. Employees in the United States exhibited more explicit emotional displays, personalized service, and engagement with customers consistent with American individualistic culture, while French employees were more instrumental in their service delivery, using more standardized language, and conducting themselves in a more professional manner, consistent with their collectivistic culture. Understanding cultural differences in employee emotional labour and expectations of customers is essential in improving service quality that meets customers' needs across different cultures.
