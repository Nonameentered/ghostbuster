The Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in Northwest Europe was a period of significant cultural change and human innovation. Archaeological and stable isotope evidence offer unique perspectives on understanding the dietary shift during this period. This essay will explore the different results in archaeological and stable isotope evidence for examining the diet shift. It will also discuss transition theories and models, the impact of sample biases and limitations of stable isotope methodology on the interpretation of dietary shift.
Archaeological and stable isotope evidence both have distinct advantages and disadvantages in the study of Mesolithic-Neolithic dietary shifts. Archaeological evidence, such as faunal remains and plant macrofossils, provide insights into food sources and subsistence strategies. However, the preservation of these materials can be affected by factors such as taphonomy and site formation processes. Stable isotope analysis of human skeletal remains provides a direct assessment of an individual's diet, but this method is limited by issues such as the complexity of sample preparation and the effect of diagenesis on isotopic ratios.
Archaeological evidence suggests that the Mesolithic-Neolithic dietary shift in Northwest Europe was multifaceted. At the onset of the Neolithic, there was a significant increase in the number of domesticated animal species, including cattle, sheep, and pigs, while hunting of wild animals such as deer, elk, and wild boar decreased. Additionally, there was a shift towards a more settled lifestyle, with an increased reliance on agriculture and the cultivation of cereals, such as wheat and barley. This is reflected in the faunal and plant remains found at archaeological sites such as Guitarrero Cave in Peru, where a significant increase in the consumption of domesticated animals was observed from the Late Pleistocene to the Early Holocene (Wells and Stock, 2007).
Stable isotope evidence offers further insights into the dietary shift at the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. Isotopic analysis of human skeletal remains can provide information on the types of food that individuals consumed over their lifetime, as isotopes in food are incorporated into human tissues at predictable rates. Carbon and nitrogen isotopes are commonly used to infer dietary composition, with carbon isotopes reflecting the sources of dietary carbohydrates (e.g. plants, cereals), and nitrogen isotopes reflecting the sources of dietary protein (e.g. meat, fish, legumes). Stable isotope studies of human remains from the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition show changes in carbon and nitrogen isotopic ratios, suggesting a shift towards a more agriculture-based diet.
For example, a study of human remains from the Early Neolithic site of Çamlıbel Tarlası in Turkey found a decrease in δ15N (nitrogen isotope measurement) values of human bones compared to those of the Late Mesolithic (Bouby et al., 2020). This decrease suggests a shift towards a more plant-based diet, potentially reflecting an increased reliance on agriculture. Similarly, a study of carbon and nitrogen isotopes from human remains at the Mesolithic-Neolithic site of Pitusas in Spain showed a decrease in δ15N values in the Early Neolithic compared to the Late Mesolithic (Bocquet-Appel et al., 2005). This shift may reflect the decrease in animal protein consumption and the increase in plant protein consumption associated with the transition to agriculture.
Transition theories and models can provide a framework for understanding the Mesolithic-Neolithic dietary shift. One such model is the "Broad Spectrum Revolution" proposed by Kent Flannery (1969), which suggests that the shift towards agriculture was one of many adaptations made by humans during a period of increasing cultural complexity. This theory posits that humans gradually diversified their diet to include a wider variety of plant and animal resources, allowing for increased food security and population growth. The increased reliance on agriculture during the Neolithic is seen as one component of this broader dietary shift.
Another model is the "Demographic Model" proposed by Peter Richerson and Robert Boyd (2001), which suggests that the shift towards agriculture was a response to population pressures and the need to sustain a growing population. This model posits that as population densities increased, the ability to obtain sufficient food through hunting and gathering alone decreased, leading to the adoption of agriculture as a more efficient means of food production. The demographic model emphasizes the role of social and economic factors in driving the Mesolithic-Neolithic dietary shift.
Limitations and sample biases of stable isotope methodology can impact the interpretation of the dietary shift during the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition. One limitation is the potential for differential preservation of various isotopes, which can lead to erroneous conclusions about diet. For example, nitrogen can be lost from bones over time through a process called diagenesis, complicating the interpretation of δ15N values (Ambrose, 1993). Additionally, stable isotope studies may suffer from sample biases, as only a small subset of the population may be represented in the samples analyzed. For example, individuals with certain burial practices or who lived in specific geographic regions may be overrepresented, potentially biasing interpretations of diet (Larsen, 2014).
In conclusion, examination of archaeological and stable isotope evidence provide unique perspectives on the Mesolithic-Neolithic dietary shift in Northwest Europe. Archaeological evidence suggests a multifaceted dietary shift towards a more settled lifestyle with increased reliance on agriculture. Stable isotope evidence supports this, demonstrating a shift towards a more agriculture-based diet. Transition theories and models provide a framework for understanding the Mesolithic-Neolithic dietary shift, emphasizing the role of increasing cultural complexity and population pressures. However, limitations and sample biases of stable isotope methodology must be considered when interpreting dietary shift. Despite these limitations, the combination of archaeological and stable isotope evidence provides important insights into the complex dietary changes during the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition.
