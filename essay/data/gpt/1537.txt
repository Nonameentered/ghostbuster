Emap is a media company known for its diverse portfolio of publications ranging from fashion, lifestyle, entertainment and music magazines. The company ventured into the women's magazine market in 1994 with the launch of an upmarket Italian magazine, Grazia. Grazia broke away from the traditional format of women's magazines and introduced a fresh and stylish approach that spoke to the modern woman. The magazine's launch was met with significant success in the women's magazine market, making it one of the biggest magazine launches in the UK. This essay will delve into the different marketing strategies that Emap used to launch Grazia successfully.
The first step in launching a new magazine is to understand the target audience. Emap identified a gap in the market for an upmarket women's magazine that spoke to the modern woman in a fresh and stylish way. Grazia was designed to appeal to urban, fashion-conscious women and offer a new perspective on fashion, lifestyle and current affairs. The magazine positioned itself as an authoritative voice on matters concerning fashion and style and promised to deliver quality content at all times.
Marketing research played an essential role in the successful launch of Grazia. The research helped Emap to gain insights into what women wanted from a magazine. They discovered that women were tired of the 'dumbed-down' content that characterized most of the women's magazines, and sought a fresh perspective that reflected their intelligence and sense of style. Grazia was designed to deliver this fresh and intelligent perspective by offering a diverse range of features that spoke to women's interests.
One of the marketing strategies Emap used to launch Grazia was to create a buzz around the magazine. They started by running teaser advertisements that revealed a glimpse of what Grazia had to offer. The ads were strategically placed in prominent locations such as bus stops and train stations to create curiosity among readers. The intent was to pique the interest of potential readers and compel them to find out more about the magazine.
Additionally, Emap created a media blitz, using a combination of print, television, and radio advertisements to promote the magazine. Their advertising campaign featured prominent celebrities such as supermodel Naomi Campbell and actress Cate Blanchett, who were shown reading Grazia in various places. The campaign was designed to suggest that Grazia was a magazine that was well-read by prominent women. The use of celebrities in the advertisements was also a clever way of creating interest among readers who were fans of the stars and, in turn, increased the magazine's visibility.
Grazia's launch was also timed for maximum impact. Emap launched the magazine in February, which is a time of the year that traditionally sees an increase in magazine sales. This timing, coupled with the advertising campaign, helped to generate anticipation among readers. Additionally, Grazia was launched during London Fashion Week, which helped to create a buzz around the magazine and positioned it as a fashion authority among readers.
The design and content of Grazia were also key marketing strategies that contributed to the magazine's success. Unlike most of the women's magazines at the time, Grazia featured a minimalist, elegant design that appealed to readers who were fashion-conscious. The magazine's layout was sophisticated and featured high-quality photographs of celebrities and fashion icons. The design was a reflection of the magazine's promise to deliver a high-end experience that spoke to the modern woman's sense of style.
The magazine's content was also carefully curated to appeal to the target audience. Grazia featured a mix of current affairs, fashion, and lifestyle articles that were well-researched and written by experts in the field. Additionally, the magazine was designed to be interactive, with quizzes and opinion polls that encouraged readers to participate. Grazia was designed to be informative, engaging, and entertaining, which was a departure from the traditional formula of most women's magazines at the time.
The timing of Grazia's launch was also crucial. The magazine was launched at a time when the women's magazine market was ripe for disruption. There was a growing dissatisfaction among readers with the conventional formula of women's magazines, which typically featured an endless stream of beauty and fashion advice. Emap identified this dissatisfaction and positioned Grazia as a breath of fresh air in the market. The magazine's content was designed to engage and inform readers, which was a radical departure from the traditional formula of women's magazines at the time.
In conclusion, launching a new magazine is a risk, but Emap's successful launch of Grazia was a testament to the company's marketing strategy. The company was able to leverage its understanding of the target audience and created an advertising campaign that generated interest among readers. Grazia's launch was timed for maximum impact, and the magazine's design and content were carefully curated to appeal to the target audience. Additionally, the magazine was launched at a time when the women's magazine market was ripe for disruption, and Grazia positioned itself as a breath of fresh air in the market. The combination of these marketing strategies led to the successful launch of Grazia, making it one of the biggest magazine launches in the UK.
