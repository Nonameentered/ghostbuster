Burial rites have always been one of the most interesting aspects of researching the social and cultural practices of any historical community. These rites are an important part of any community, as they demonstrate how the people at the time viewed death, the afterlife, and social status. The importance and complexity of burial rites shows the key aspects of medieval society, such as religious beliefs, hierarchy, and social norms. These observations play a critical role in archaeological research, as they help to draw conclusions about early medieval society. In this essay, we will explore how burial rites can be used as evidence to draw conclusions about early medieval society.
One of the most important fundamentals of burial rites in early medieval society was religion. Religion played a significant part in the lives of early medieval people and had a direct impact on their burial customs. Religion was seen as a guiding authority, and the belief in an afterlife influenced the way people thought about death, burial and the body. For instance, Christianity was a significant religion in early medieval society, and it influenced the funeral customs of the Christians of the time. According to historical evidence, Christian burials focused on the idea of resurrection. They believed that the body would be resurrected on the day of judgment and, therefore, it was important to preserve the body. To help achieve this, Christians often placed the body in a stone or monolithic coffin, which served as a protective housing. The use of such a coffin is an indication of the high status of the individual, and it also represents the strong belief in the afterlife.
In contrast, Pagans had a different perspective on burial customs. They believed that the dead would live on after death and that it was essential to honor the dead with proper burial rites. According to the historical records, pagans primarily used cremation during burials. The ashes of the person were then collected and buried, usually in an urn as a representation of their body. The use of cremation was evidence of Pagan customs and beliefs such as reincarnation and earth worship.
Another way in which burial rites can draw conclusions about early medieval society was through the examination of grave goods. Grave goods are personal objects or essential items that were placed inside the graves with the deceased. The selection of goods could indicate social status, beliefs, and societal norms during the time period. For example, when it comes to gendered grave goods, women were often buried with jewelry, combs, and mirrors, indicating their high status and the importance of their appearance. Men, on the other hand, were buried with weapons like swords, knives, and shields, indicating their status as warriors, which was highly valued in early medieval society.
Grave goods also reveal a lot about the economy and the trade of the time. For example, if a burial site is found with objects made from precious stones or metals, it tells us the amount of wealth and trade that existed in that society. The objects found in burial sites can also indicate the type of trade or interaction of the society with other cultures. This is because the tradesmen might only trade valuable objects with people from other countries, thereby creating a strong connection with the external world. 
Additionally, grave goods may show the religious beliefs of the society as well. Amulets, charms, and religious items in a grave may indicate the religious view of that individual or the community as a whole. In Early Anglo-Saxon society, the items found in graves gave credence to the Pagan beliefs of the time. One example of this is the excavated Sutton Hoo ship burial, which was found in 1939 in East Anglia, England. The Sutton Hoo ship burial contained many grave goods, including intricate gold jewelry, images of animals, and a sword. The burial goods found in the Sutton Hoo ship discloses the status of the individual and also shows the significance of Paganism in the early medieval society. The intricate gold ornaments and artistic craftsmanship illustrate the sophisticated cultural practices and the advanced economy of the society, which is not evident in the written sources. The religious objects that were also found within the Sutton Hoo burial illustrate the importance of religion, which was more evident in Paganism rather than Christianity during that period.
Furthermore, grave goods can also signify the power structures and social hierarchy of medieval society. The objects found in the graves of the elites or high power persons were deemed as luxurious and highly ornamental, while the ones found in a commoner's burial site were less decorative and simpler. The objects found in the graves of wealthy individuals also indicate the importance of superiority and power in the society. The fact that societal elites were buried differently is an indication of the types of power structures that existed in early medieval society. The hierarchy of the society was based on wealth, power, and social status, which was reinforced through burial rites.
Finally, burial rites can help to demonstrate the changes in societal beliefs and practices over time. Through examining grave burials, researchers can observe how societal norms changed as a result of religious, economic, and political changes. For instance, during the early medieval period, Christianity replaced Paganism as the dominant religion in Europe. One way to observe the changes in beliefs and values is through the changes in burial rites. In 7th century England, Pagan graves started to shift towards Christianity, indicating the changes in religion and beliefs of the society. The early medieval society's adherence to Christianity can be reflected in the motifs of the objects inside the graves. Christian graves were adorned with crosses, gospels, and religious carvings, signifying the shift towards Christian beliefs.
In conclusion, the way a society treats its deceased tells a lot about their beliefs, values, and cultural practices. Burial rites can, therefore, be used to draw conclusions about early medieval society. Through the examination of the burial customs, the type of burial, the presence of grave goods, and other artifacts such as religious objects, social hierarchy and power structures, economic relations and interactions with foreign cultures, and changes based on religion over time can be adequately observed. Burial rites are an excellent source of historical evidence when it comes to analyzing early medieval societies. It is, therefore, crucial for researchers to study burial customs and practices to better understand the social and cultural values of early medieval times.
