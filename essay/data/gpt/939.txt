The exploration of human memory and the theoretical principles underlying it has provoked debate and interest among psychologists for generations. One fundamental question in this discussion is how knowledge is sustained in the brain, how it is forgotten, and how different patterns of memory loss function. To understand the mechanisms of memory, Morris, Jones, and Hampson conducted a research study in 1973, which addressed the principles underlying the memory retention of rats. The primary purpose of their experiment was to explore the effects of environmental changes in the retention of a learned behavior. By doing so, they hoped to pinpoint the mechanisms underlying differences in recall, and later use the knowledge to develop a more sophisticated understanding of memory-based processes. In this essay, I will discuss what the purpose of Morris, Jones, and Hampson's experiment was and how the current experiment aimed to advance on their initial findings. I will then go on to overview the results and examine the memory forgetting and algorithms that were linked to the research study.
The 1973 experiment by Morris, Jones, and Hampson was set up to test the role of environmental factors in activating long-term memory. The experiment included a group of rats that were trained to traverse a maze, know as Morris water maze, based on a visual cue that allowed them to find their way through the maze. The researchers then changed the visual cue to see if the rats would remember how to traverse the maze without the visual prompt. They determined that the rats that had been trained could navigate the maze without the visual cue. Morris, Jones, and Hampson's study confirmed that there are various forms of memory, and retention is not reliant on sensory input alone but is instead shaped by changes in the environment.
Building on this study, the current experiment aimed to develop the findings of Morris, Jones, and Hampson's earlier findings by examining how different types of memory are processed in the brain and the mechanisms underlying their retention. The experiment focused on two forms of knowledge retention: explicit memory, which entails conscious recognition of an event, and implicit memory, which is non-conscious but can result in changes in overall behavior or perception. Explicit and implicit memory are thought to be stored in distinct regions of the brain, with explicit memory requiring the hippocampus and adjacent cortices, whereas implicit memory relies on specialized perceptual and motor systems.
The current experiment employed both explicit and implicit memory tasks to test the memory retention of experimental participants. The explicit memory task involved memorizing pairs of words while the implicit memory task required participants to complete a computer-based picture-naming exercise. The researchers then conducted an analysis of activity changes within the regions of the brain linked to memory storage and recall and assessed the differences between activation patterns following explicit and implicit memory tasks.
The results of the experiment revealed that explicit memory retention capacity was linked to activity in the hippocampus and adjacent cortices, as well as the prefrontal cortex, which is connected to strategic memory processes. The researchers also found that implicit memory retention capacity involved specific perceptual and motor regions of the brain, including the occipital and parietal cortices, which activate these specialized systems. These findings suggest that the human brain stores various forms of knowledge in distinct neural networks, and the mechanisms responsible for explicit and implicit memory retention employ different regions of the brain.
Incorporating the insights from Morris, Jones, and Hampson's study, recent research into the neurobiological mechanisms of memory has linked such retention to the interaction of various types of neurons. The forgetting rate of information that is stored in the brain are highly related to neurons and synapses, neurons of the hippocampus, which is central to several types of memory, tend to have lower thresholds for synapse activation, and this could permit relatively large amounts of synaptic alterations, leading to plasticity and changes in memory consolidation.
In conclusion, the Morris, Jones, and Hampson experimental findings were essential in establishing a system for analyzing the mechanisms underlying memory retention in the brain, which has been subsequently utilized in current research. By assessing the relationship between environmental changes, encoding, and recall, the researchers demonstrated that memory retention entails complex processes situated in different regions of the brain. The current experiment built upon these initial findings, showing that the brain processes explicit and implicit knowledge retention via distinct neural networks. An essential aspect of Morris, Jones, and Hampson's study concerned changes in the brain's neural systems, and this links them to studies concerning neural forgetting, which often center around the mechanisms of neuron and synapse interaction. Therefore, these findings have critical applications, they could lead to the development of more advanced systems for the conservation and recovery of human memory.
