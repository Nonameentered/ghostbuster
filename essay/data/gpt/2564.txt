Television advertisements are ubiquitous in our society â€“ they are everywhere we go, whether it is on our television sets, streaming platforms, or social media feeds. Successful commercials have the potential to capture our attention, persuade us to buy a product or service, and stay with us long after they have aired. A considerable factor in the effectiveness of an advertisement is language. Language can be used to appeal to emotions, create a sense of urgency, or convey a particular message. For this reason, it is crucial to analyze the use of language in television advertisements. This essay will examine a study that analyzes the use of language in a television advertisement, how it relates to linguistics, the aim of the study, the methods used, the challenges encountered during the study, and how they were addressed. Furthermore, I will discuss how the opinions of the informants correlate with existing research on dialects in linguistics.
Linguistics is the scientific study of language. It comprises several branches, including phonetics, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, which all contribute to our understanding of how language operates and evolves. While many people assume that linguistics is only related to grammar and the spoken language, the discipline is also concerned with non-verbal communication and how it is used to convey meaning. An advertisement is a prime example of how language is used in a non-verbal way for a specific purpose. Advertisements are usually created to increase brand recognition, promote specific products or services, or change public opinion about a particular issue.
To achieve these goals, advertisers need to use language that resonates with the target audience. Hence, language has become an essential part of advertising, and its study has gained significant attention in the field of linguistics. The study of the use of language in television advertisements offers a unique perspective on how language is used to create a particular impression or response in people.
The aim of the study analyzed in this essay is to examine the use of language in a UK television advertisement for a chocolate bar. The main objective is to explore how language is used in the ad to persuade the target audience to buy the product. The study is based on the analysis of natural language data from the advertisement and the opinions of informants who viewed the ad. The researchers used a qualitative approach that involved audio or video recordings and transcripts of interviews with the informants. The analysis involved identifying linguistic features present in the advertisement, such as vocabulary, syntax, and prosody. The researchers then compared these features to the ones used in other commercials to understand how language is used to create persuasive messages.
One of the main challenges encountered during this study was selecting appropriate informants for the research. The study had to ensure that the informants were representative of the target audience for the chocolate bar advertised on the television. The researchers needed to ensure that they selected people who had watched the advertisement and were willing to provide meaningful feedback. This aspect was challenging because it required the researchers to approach potential participants who had no prior involvement in the research.
To address this challenge, the researchers used a sampling method to select participants that matched the target audience characteristics. They selected individuals who had watched the advertisement on television and were over the legal age limit to purchase the chocolate bar. The informants were also varied in age, education, gender, and ethnicity to ensure that the feedback gathered reflected a broader representation of the population.
Another challenge faced in this study was the need to be mindful of the language used by the informants during interviews. The researchers were analyzing the use of language in an advertisement and also assessing the opinions of the informants on the advertisement. Thus, it was crucial not to influence the informants' opinions, and to ensure that their feedback was genuine and uninfluenced by the researchers' questions.
To address this challenge, the researchers employed a neutral interview style that did not lead the informants towards any particular answer. They also made use of open-ended questions that allowed the informants to provide detailed feedback. Furthermore, the researchers were mindful of the language they used in the questions and avoided using words that could lead the informants to a particular answer.
The opinions of the informants in this study correlate with existing research on dialects in linguistics. Many studies have shown that people's language use varies depending on factors such as age, gender, ethnicity, occupation, and geographical location. The informants' opinions on the use of language in the advertisement support this finding. For example, some informants pointed out that the use of language was more appealing to a specific age group than others. This finding mirrors previous studies that have shown that different age groups rely on different linguistic cues to determine whether an advertisement is relevant to them.
Similarly, some informants pointed out that the use of certain dialects may appeal more to different ethnicities. This finding is supported by previous research that has shown that people often identify with individuals who share their dialect or accent. Hence linguistic features such as the use of slang, regional accents, and colloquial language can create a sense of familiarity and sense of belonging with the audience.
To conclude, this essay has discussed the study analyzing the use of language in a television advertisement and its relationship to linguistics. The study's main aim was to analyze the use of language in a UK television advertisement for a chocolate bar and identify how language is used to persuade the target audience to buy the product. The study used a qualitative approach that involved analyzing natural language data from the advertisement and the opinions of informants. The research encountered challenges such as selecting appropriate informants and ensuring that their feedback was genuine and unbiased. However, the research addressed these challenges by using a sampling method and employing a neutral interview style. The opinions of the informants in the study correlate with existing research in dialects in linguistics. Finally, the study shows that language is a vital element in advertising, and the use of language can be carefully crafted to appeal to specific audiences.
