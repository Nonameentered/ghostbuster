Introduction:
Since the advent of the internet, the music industry has undergone a profound transformation with the rise of digital music. The introduction of legal digital music platforms, such as Apple Music and Spotify, has provided consumers with new ways to access music, while providing a legal framework for artists to monetize their work. However, the birth of a legal digital music market has also had significant structural implications; both positive and negative. This essay will explore how the development of a legal digital music market impacts the structure of the music industry, potential dangers of a monopoly in the music industry, and how the emergence of the legal digital market creates a more competitive industry.
Impact of the development of a legal digital music market on the structure of the music industry:
The development of digital music has resulted in a significant shift in the structure of the music industry, with traditional record labels losing much of their power. Before the rise of digital music, traditional record labels held a dominant position in the market, owning distribution channels and holding extensive catalogs of musical artists. They were masters of their own domain and acted as gatekeepers for new artists who wished to enter the industry.
However, with the advent of legal digital music platforms, consumers have grown more willing to pay for subscription services rather than purchasing physical media. This change in consumer behavior has led to a decrease in the sales of traditional music records and CDs. As a result, traditional record labels have had to adapt to the changing marketplace, and, in turn, new companies have been able to enter the market.
This shift in the structure of the music industry has allowed for a range of new companies to enter the market, including online music stores, streaming services, and artist promotion platforms, such as SoundCloud and Bandcamp. Rather than being controlled by a small number of conglomerates, these new platforms offer more opportunities for independent artists and smaller labels to get their music out to listeners. As a result, musical diversity has thrived, and consumers of music are more likely to listen to lesser-known artists than they were in the past.
Potential dangers of a monopoly in the music industry: 
While the rise of digital music has positively impacted the industry, it has also introduced new challenges and potential danger. The greatest threat to the industry comes from the concentration of power in the hands of a small number of companies, potentially creating a monopoly.
Monopolies are problematic as they allow a single company to have disproportionate power in the industry and provide an unfair advantage over other businesses. This can result in less competition, higher prices for consumers, and fewer opportunities for independent artists to succeed. The danger comes from the possibility that the big players in this industry may become established monopolies, leading to reduced competition and an impoverishing of the industry. In the worst-case scenario, these established monopolies may act to control the distribution of music to serve their own interests, leading to a significant conflict of interests with the artists.
One company that has drawn particular attention is Spotify, which dominates the streaming market and has been criticized for its royalty policies. The company has been accused of underpaying artists, which has led to disputes between Spotify and much of the music industry. If Spotify were to become a monopoly in the music industry, the consequences could be severe, potentially leading to less investment in new musical talent, less diversity in music, and fewer opportunities for independent artists to succeed.
How the emergence of the legal digital market creates a more competitive industry:
Despite these potential threats, the emergence of legal digital music services has created a more competitive industry. The digital music market offers greater options to consumers, creating new business opportunities for smaller companies to enter the industry. Services such as Soundcloud and Bandcamp have democratized the music industry, allowing independent artists to bypass traditional record labels and promote their music directly to consumers.
The digital music market has also increased transparency and accessibility, providing consumers with greater access to a wider range of music. The lower barriers to entry have provided new opportunities for artists to monetize their music, potentially earning more royalties and greater control over their work. For example, artists can now upload their music to music distribution platforms such as TuneCore and DistroKid. These services allow artists to distribute their music to many different online music platforms simultaneously. Thus, independent artists seeking to distribute their music can compete with established record labels and their vast distribution channels through this new digital music market. 
The music industry now is rapidly changing and likely to keep doing so. The technology-driven future presents many opportunities that the future producers, record labels and artists should be ready to grasp. Overall, technology-based innovations, including the development of the legal digital music market, have created new opportunities for artists to be paid for their music, created more diversity of music, and democratized access to the industry for independent artists and smaller labels. However, it is essential to avoid any accumulation of power in the hands of one or a few large music conglomerates. To prevent the detrimental consequences of monopolies, new regulations may need to be established. It is an exciting time for music as we see advancements that are changing the face of how the industry is structured and functions. These advancements are positive, providing a more fair and balanced way to get music to listeners. The music industry is in a state of flux, and the winners in the market will be those companies that are innovative and flexible enough to evolve with the times. 
Conclusion:
The development of a legal digital music market has been both a blessing and a curse for the music industry. On the one hand, it has opened up new doors, creating opportunities for independent artists and increasing accessibility for consumers. At the same time, the rise of digital music has also presented threats such as the potential concentration of power and monopolistic behavior. To foster a more competitive industry, excellent regulation needs to be established to foster innovation while preventing monopolies. Regardless of the obstacles faced, it is undeniable that the digital music revolution has changed the business forever, and the industry can only thrive if we are open and innovative. Companies and individuals alike that are willing to adapt will be the ones to come out on top.
