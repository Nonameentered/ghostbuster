PRIONICS Proposal 
The PRIONICS proposal is to provide audio consultancy services to target the expanding hi-fi separates market. According to the company, the target market is consumers who are looking for an exceptional audio experience. The company's services will be designed to improve high-end systems to ensure that they deliver high-quality sound. The company will offer advice and calibration services to its clients to ensure that their systems are optimized for the best sound quality. Additionally, the company will sell accessories at a discounted cost to help clients upgrade their systems and enhance their audio experience.
