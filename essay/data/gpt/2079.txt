Antioxidant enzymes and dietary antioxidants play a crucial role in the human body. Antioxidant enzymes help in the neutralization of free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can cause damage to cells and tissues. The dietary antioxidants, on the other hand, are found in various foods, including fruits, vegetables, and nuts, and they help in reducing the number of free radicals in the body. This results in a lower risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.
The antioxidant capacity of various fruit juices, teas, and coffees was determined in the study by measuring the absorbance value of a solution after adding a free radical initiator. The absorbance value of the solution decreases as the concentration of the antioxidant increases. Therefore, beverages with a higher antioxidant capacity will have a lower absorbance value.
Several dietary antioxidants are found in fruits and vegetables. Vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, and flavonoids are some of the antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables. These antioxidants play different roles in the body, such as protecting the cells from oxidative damage and reducing inflammation.
In the study, a correlation was found between the concentration of vitamin C and absorbance value. The higher the concentration of vitamin C, the lower the absorbance value. This means that vitamin C is an important antioxidant that can help reduce the number of free radicals in the body.
The beverage with the greatest antioxidant capacity in the study was hibiscus tea. This is because hibiscus tea contains a high concentration of polyphenols, a type of antioxidant that is known to have potent health benefits. Polyphenols can help reduce inflammation, stabilize blood sugar levels, and improve heart health.
Investigating antioxidant capacity is important because it helps us understand how different foods and beverages can affect our health. We can use this information to make informed decisions about our diet and choose foods that are rich in antioxidants. To achieve the reproducibility of results, it is essential to follow standardized protocols and use reliable methods of measurement.
Consumers can use this information to select foods that are rich in antioxidants and improve their health. For example, they can choose to consume fruits and vegetables that are high in vitamin C, such as kiwis, oranges, and strawberries. They can also opt for beverages such as green tea, hibiscus tea or coffee, which are rich in polyphenols and have a higher antioxidant capacity.
In conclusion, antioxidant enzymes and dietary antioxidants play a significant role in the human body and can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases. The antioxidant capacity of various foods and beverages can be measured using standardized protocols, and this information can be used to aid consumers in selecting foods that are rich in antioxidants. By consuming a diet rich in antioxidants, we can improve our health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases.
