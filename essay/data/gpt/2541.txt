Introduction
Moral realism is the philosophical position that there are objective moral facts that exist independently of human thought or perception. Naturalist Moral Realism, on the other hand, is a version of moral realism that holds that these objective moral facts are natural facts and can be identified through the scientific method. There are different versions of naturalist moral realism, but Michael Smith's view in his book "The Moral Problem" is one of the most influential. 
In this essay, I will first explain the fundamental objection to Naturalist Moral Realism and then analyze Smith's proposed solution. I will evaluate his solution by considering the arguments presented by David Brink and David Copp and the counter-arguments they provide. Finally, I will consider whether it is possible to be a naturalist moral realist without denying the connection between moral judgements and motivation. 
The Objection to Naturalist Moral Realism
The fundamental objection to Naturalist Moral Realism is the so-called "open question argument." This argument was first put forward by G.E. Moore, who argued that moral properties cannot be reduced to natural properties. According to Moore, when we ask whether something is right or wrong, we are asking a question about its moral properties. But when we ask whether something has a certain natural property, like being water, we are not asking a moral question. Moore argued that the fact that we can ask whether something is right or wrong without also asking whether it has a certain natural property shows that moral properties are irreducible to natural properties. 
This argument poses a problem for naturalist moral realists, who claim that moral properties can be identified through the scientific method. If moral properties cannot be reduced to natural properties, then it is not possible to identify them scientifically. In other words, naturalist moral realists cannot claim that moral facts are "out there" in the world waiting to be discovered by science, because moral facts do not exist independently of our moral concepts. 
Michael Smith's Solution
Michael Smith's response to the open question argument is to argue that the question "Is x good?" is logically equivalent to the question "Is it the case that we have reason to approve of x?" According to Smith, moral judgements are intrinsically motivating, which means that when we make a moral judgement, we are already motivated to act in accordance with it. This is what explains the logic of the above two questions being equivalent. 
This view is called "internalism," because it holds that there is an internal connection between moral judgement and motivation. According to Smith, to make a moral judgement is already to have a certain kind of motivational state, which then serves to ground the judgement. In other words, the reason why x is good is because we have reason to approve of x, and the reason why we have reason to approve of x is that we are already motivated to do so. 
Smith's solution, then, is to deny that moral properties are irreducible to natural properties. Moral properties, according to Smith, are not a special kind of property that can be discovered through a different method than other properties, like physical or chemical properties. Instead, moral properties are natural properties that can be identified through the normal scientific method, but they are also intrinsically motivating in a way that other properties are not. 
Evaluation of Smith's Solution
David Brink objects to Smith's solution by arguing that the internalist thesis is false. Brink argues that it is a mistake to equate "being a reason for action" with "being intrinsically motivating." While it is true that reasons are necessary for motivation, Brink argues that reasons can also be extrinsic. In other words, while we might have a reason to do something, we might not be motivated to do it unless we have some other desire or motive that is already present. Brink also argues that there can be reasons for action that we are not motivated to act on, because we believe that other reasons outweigh them. 
David Copp makes a similar objection, but from a different angle. Copp argues that Smith's account fails to capture the fact that moral judgements have an "objective standpoint." According to Copp, moral judgements are not just expressions of our own subjective preferences or motivations. They are also claims about how things objectively ought to be, and this objective standpoint is not captured by Smith's account. 
Counter-arguments to Brink and Copp
Smith responds to Brink by arguing that the internalist thesis is only meant to apply to what he calls "pro tanto" reasons. That is, reasons that count in favor of doing something, but which can be outweighed by other reasons. Smith argues that it is true that pro tanto reasons are not necessarily intrinsically motivating, but he argues that this does not affect his overall account of moral motivation. According to Smith, when we make a moral judgement, we are already motivated by the pro tanto reason that counts in favor of acting in accordance with the moral judgement. 
Smith responds to Copp by arguing that his account does capture the objectivity of moral judgements. According to Smith, when we make a moral judgement, we are expressing a normative claim about what objectively ought to be the case. However, this normative claim is grounded in our own motivational states, which is what gives it the objectivity that it has. In other words, the fact that moral judgements are based on our own motivational states does not mean that they are not objective. 
Can One be a Naturalist Moral Realist without Denying the Connection Between Moral Judgements and Motivation?
In conclusion, Michael Smith's proposed solution to the open question argument is to deny that moral properties are irreducible to natural properties. Smith argues that moral properties are natural properties that can be identified through the normal scientific method, but they are also intrinsically motivating in a way that other properties are not. This solution has been challenged by David Brink and David Copp, who argue that Smith's account fails to capture important features of moral judgements, such as the objectivity and non-intrinsicness of reasons for action. 
Ultimately, the question of whether one can be a naturalist moral realist without denying the connection between moral judgements and motivation depends on how one understands the relationship between reasons and motivation. If reasons are always intrinsically motivating, then Smith's view is plausible. But if there can be extrinsic reasons that are not intrinsically motivating, then Smith's account might be incomplete. Regardless of whether one accepts Smith's solution or not, the open question argument has shown that moral properties are not reducible to natural properties in a straightforward way.
