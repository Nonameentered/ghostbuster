Introduction
Contract law is a fundamental aspect of any society or business economy. It is the set of laws indicating the legal relationship between two parties in a contract. The legal doctrine of privity refers to the legal relationship in contract law between two parties who form a contract. It determines the rights and obligations of each party in the contract. The doctrine of consideration, on the other hand, refers to the element of exchange in contract law. This paper will expound on the historical development and contemporary relevance of the doctrine of privity in contract law and how it is related to the doctrine of consideration.
Historical Development of the Doctrine of Privity
The development of the doctrine of privity in contract law goes back to the 19th century. In early English law, the doctrine of privity derived its foundations from feudal law. The feudal lord owned all properties, and only those who owned property were in a position to contract. Hence, only those with property rights could make enforceable contracts. The common law of England, which had emerged by the late 12th century, did not recognize the capacity of a person to enter into a contract through an agent. Therefore, in contract disputes, privity was essential to restrict claims by third parties to enforce contracts.
The doctrine of privity later evolved after the case between Tweedle v Atkinson, 1861. The case involved two parties; the father of the groom, William Tweedle, and his son-in-law, John Atkinson. The father had made a contract with Atkinson stating that he would make a payment of 200 pounds to the groom if he married his daughter Ellen Tweedle. After the marriage, William fulfilled his part of the contract by making the payment. However, Atkinson did not fulfill his part of the agreement, prompting Tweedle to sue him. The court held that Tweedle did not have the right to enforce the contract because he had no privity with Atkinson. This landmark case established the doctrine of privity, which ruled that only parties to a contract have the right to enforce it.
The doctrine of privity later evolved further after the case of Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd. v Selfridge & Co. Ltd, 1915. In this case, Dunlop sold several tyres to the Dew Company, which then sold the tyres to Selfridge & Co. Selfridge had given an undertaking to Dew that they would not sell the tyres below a specified price. However, Selfridge breached the undertaking. Dunlop sued Selfridge, relying on their contract with Dew. The court held that Dunlop could not sue Selfridge because they had no privity with the third party, even though Dunlop had entered into a contract with their customer, Dew. This case established the doctrine of privity as a fundamental principle in contract law.
Contemporary Relevance of the Doctrine of Privity
The doctrine of privity remains fundamental in modern contract law, as it defines the relationship between parties to a contract. The doctrine ensures that only contracting parties benefit from the contract. If the doctrine were not applicable, a third party would have the right to enforce the contract, causing chaos in contract agreements. The doctrine effectively makes sure that parties to a contract receive the benefits of the exchange and are the only people who can sue for breach of contract.
The doctrine of privity, however, has some exceptions that have emerged in contemporary contract law. In some cases, third parties may have a right to enforce a contract that they are not a party to. The courts have attempted to develop the doctrine of privity beyond its traditional limits to ensure that the law is fair to all parties concerned. Some exceptions include trustees, assignees, and beneficiaries of an agreement, statutory exceptions and collateral contracts.
The first exception is the concept of collateral contracts. A collateral contract consists of a separate agreement that affects the enforcement of a primary contract. The collateral contract contains an undertaking by a third party to a contract to support the primary contract. The collateral contract creates a legal bond between the third party and the original contracting parties. This concept allows the third party to sue for a breach of the primary contract and provides a remedy when one of the parties to the original contract has breached their contractual obligations.
A second exception is when a third party is a trust beneficiary. In this case, the trust beneficiary has privity with the original contracting parties by means of a contract they are not a party. The court holds that the trustee makes a promise on behalf of the trustee. Thus, the courts allow the trust beneficiary to sue for a breach of contract by the trustee. In this way, the doctrine of privity is applied to ensure that the trust beneficiary receives benefits from the trust.
The final exception is when statute law grants a third party a right to enforce a contract. Statute law may create an exception to the doctrine of privity in some contracts. For example, the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 allows a third party, who is not a party to a contract, to enforce a benefit conferred by the contract. The intention of this Act was to provide relief to contracting parties. For example, It allows an employee to enforce the benefits of a contract between their employer and the contractor.
The Doctrine of Consideration
The doctrine of consideration refers to the practical benefit conferred between the parties in a contract. It is an exchange of something of value, which is usually of a financial nature, between the parties to the contract. Consideration is essential to ensure that the parties exchange something of value and guarantee that each party has an intention to be legally bound. In English law, the doctrine of consideration has been a fundamental principle of contract law.
The common law has developed different tests to determine what constitutes as consideration. One such test is the legal benefit or detriment test. The test holds that for there to be consideration; there must be a legal detriment or benefit conferred on the parties involved. The courts have held that the legal benefit conferred must have some worth or value, and that parties must have a genuine intention to enter into a contract freely.
The doctrine of privity is closely related to the doctrine of consideration since it determines the relationship between parties in a contract. For instance, in a simple contract, consideration may consist of a promise to do something. In such a contract, each party is bound by the mutual understanding that both have obligations. In most cases, such an exchange involves the exchange of money or other valuable assets, and each party to the contract receives an advantage in the transaction.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the doctrine of privity is an essential element of contract law that defines the legal relationship between contracting parties. It ensures that only parties to a contract can sue or enforce the contract. However, exceptions have emerged, such as the concept of collateral contract, trust beneficiary and statutory exceptions. The doctrine of privity is closely related to the doctrine of consideration because it determines the relationship between parties in a contract. Both doctrines complement each other by ensuring that parties fulfill their contractual obligations. Therefore, the significance of the privity doctrine remains relevant in modern contract law and its evolution will play a significant role in cases in the future.
