Through my work experiences in hospitality management, I have learned a great deal about the importance of customer service and personal development. Two managerial skills that I have gained are effective communication and problem-solving. Communicating with customers and finding solutions to their problems is essential in this industry. Another skill I have gained is time management, where I fix work schedules according to staffing requirements.
However, two skills that I have not acquired yet are effective delegation and conflict resolution. Delegating tasks and resolving conflicts are important managerial skills, but I have not yet been in a position to learn these two skills to the fullest.
Kolb's Learning Cycle model explains the learning process in four stages- concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. For example, when a customer complains, I face a challenge, or a concrete experience, where observing and reflecting helps me identify the cause of the problem, abstract conceptualization. Then I experiment with different solutions, active experimentation, and choose the one that solves the customer's problem best.
In the hospitality industry, interpersonal skills are crucial to meeting customer expectations. Author Cindy Ann Peterson emphasizes active listening to improve communication, whereas Emily J. M. Knox highlights the importance of empathy and compassion.
The Meridien Dona Filipa in Portugal has done a tremendous job at meeting customer expectations. Their procedures were thorough and efficient, and they exceeded expectations with their personalized services. Additionally, they had a robust feedback system to ensure they were consistently meeting or exceeding their customers' needs. 
In conclusion, working in hospitality management has allowed me to develop critical skills such as communication, problem-solving, and time management. Through Kolb's Learning Cycle model, I have observed and reflected on customer interactions, conceptualized solutions, and experimented. There is still room for improvement in my delegation and conflict resolution skills, which I will continue to work on. Lastly, analyzing the Meridien Dona Filipa's customer satisfaction procedures has shown me the importance of personalized services and feedback systems in meeting customer expectations.
