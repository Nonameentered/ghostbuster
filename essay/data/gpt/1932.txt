Lastminute.com, an online travel and leisure platform, has undergone a significant transformation in recent years, changing its business orientation from product to marketing orientation. In this essay, I will explore the factors that influenced this change and how the company adjusted its marketing mix to meet the needs and wants of its customers.
Product Orientation
When Lastminute.com was first launched in 1998, its business orientation was product-focused. The company primarily sold last-minute travel and leisure deals, providing consumers with an opportunity to book holidays, flights, and entertainment at discounted rates. Lastminute.com's product-focused approach was based on a belief that a significant proportion of consumers make their purchase decisions based on the features and benefits of the product.
The product-focused approach also resulted in the company investing heavily in technology, operational efficiency, and supply chain management. These investments allowed Lastminute.com to secure exclusive deals with airlines, hotels, and entertainment venues, enabling them to offer consumers a wide range of high-quality products.
Marketing Orientation
Over the years, changes in the market environment, along with shifts in consumer behaviors and preferences, forced Lastminute.com to change its business orientation from product to marketing orientation. The shift in focus was a response to the increasing competition and fragmentation of the travel and leisure industry.
Marketing orientation is an approach in which a company focuses on satisfying customer needs by understanding their wants and preferences. This approach is based on the belief that understanding the customer's needs is essential to providing a satisfactory experience. The shift towards a marketing orientation led Lastminute.com to focus on understanding its customers better, identifying their needs and preferences, and adapting its marketing mix accordingly.
Factors Influencing the Change
Competition
The emergence of new competitors in the market made it imperative for Lastminute.com to shift its focus from products to marketing. Companies like Expedia, Booking.com, and Airbnb began to offer consumers an alternative to Lastminute.com. Expedia, for example, provided consumers with a broader range of travel services, allowing them to book hotels and flights as well as car rentals and tourist activities. The entry of these new players led to increased competition in the market, making it necessary for Lastminute.com to redefine its business approach.
Changes in Consumer Behavior
Changes in consumer behavior, such as the increasing use of mobile devices and the growing popularity of social media, created new opportunities for marketing-oriented approaches. Mobile devices, for instance, allow companies to reach their customers in new ways, providing consumers with immediate access to travel services and deals. Social media also enables companies to understand their customers' needs and preferences by collecting data on activities, interests, and behaviors. Lastminute.com recognized these changes and adapted its marketing mix to meet the needs and wants of its customers.
Shift in Customer Preferences
As the global travel and leisure industry became more competitive, consumers began to prioritize different factors when making their purchase decisions. For example, customers began to demand greater personalization, flexibility, and convenience. The shift in customer preferences created new challenges for Lastminute.com, which needed to adjust its marketing mix accordingly.
Adjusting the Marketing Mix
To adapt to the shift towards marketing orientation, Lastminute.com adjusted its marketing mix through changes in product, price, promotion, and place.
Product
Lastminute.com customized its product offerings to meet the needs and preferences of different customer segments. For instance, the company introduced a new product line called "Top Secret Hotels," which provided customers with access to top-rated hotels at reduced rates. These options catered to customers with specific tastes and requirements, providing them with a greater level of choice, flexibility, and convenience.
Price
Lastminute.com adjusted its pricing strategy to increase value for customers and gain a competitive advantage. The company employed dynamic pricing, which altered prices in real-time based on demand, seasonality, and other factors. This pricing strategy helped Lastminute.com remain competitive by offering customers deals that were tailored to their specific needs.
Promotion
Lastminute.com's promotion strategy changed from a traditional focus on advertising to a more personalized approach to marketing. The company began to use social media, email marketing, and other digital channels to engage with its customers directly, acquire new customers and personalize offers. The shift towards personalized promotion helped Lastminute.com to enhance its relationships with customers.
Place
The evolution of technology made it possible for Lastminute.com to broaden its distribution channels, reaching new customers and expanding its geographical presence. The company diversified its distribution channels by partnering with emerging platforms like Google, Amazon, and Uber. These partnerships enabled Lastminute.com to leverage the reach of these platforms, increase their visibility, and gain wider access to new customers.
Conclusion
Lastminute.com's transformation from a product-oriented company to marketing-oriented is a testament to the impact of market changes and consumer behavior. The shift to marketing orientation allowed Lastminute.com to better understand customer needs and preferences, enabling them to deliver tailored services and create greater value for customers. By adjusting its marketing mix through changes in product, price, promotion, and place, Lastminute.com succeeded in retaining its market share and competitive advantage. In today's highly competitive and rapidly evolving travel and leisure industry, a marketing-oriented business orientation is essential to stay ahead.
