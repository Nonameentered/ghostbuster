Polystyrene, a widely used thermoplastic material, is formed by polymerising styrene monomers using different polymerisation techniques. Nitroxide mediated radical polymerisation (NMRP) and atom transfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) are two methods that are known to produce high-quality polystyrene, but they have several differences in their mechanisms. Recently, there has been a growing interest in using a simultaneous combination of NMRP and ATRP initiators in the formation of polystyrene because of the potential benefits that can be obtained from both mechanisms. 
NMRP is a controlled radical polymerisation technique that employs a stable organic free radical as a mediator to control and slow down the polymerisation reaction. It involves a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) mechanism that works by exchanging the propagating radical with the mediator. This mechanism results in fewer chain terminations, leading to prolonged living radical polymerisation and the production of high-quality, low-polydispersity polymers. 
On the other hand, ATRP is a reversible deactivation radical polymerisation technique that uses a metal catalyst to activate the dormant halogen initiators and generate a propagating radical. This technique also results in well-defined, low-polydispersity polymers, as the process of generating the propagating radical user reversible reactions that reduce chain termination. 
When a combination of NMRP and ATRP initiators is used in the formation of polystyrene, each mechanism contributes its unique properties to the polymerisation process. Using the two mechanisms simultaneously can result in better control over the reaction, leading to an increase in the polymerisation rate, low polydispersity, and the production of a high-quality polystyrene. 
The potential outcomes of combining NMRP and ATRP initiators in making polystyrene are numerous. Firstly, the use of NMRP could aid in maintaining a lower level of radicals in the reaction while keeping the reaction rate at a constant level. Secondly, NMRP can produce polystyrene with a uniform chain length and low polydispersity. On the other hand, ATRP has the potential to control the reaction rate and produce a highly controllable polymer that has a low degree of branching. These outcomes collectively lead to the production of a high-quality and well-defined polystyrene. 
The mechanism of the simultaneous use of NMRP and ATRP initiators in the formation of polystyrene depends on several factors. One factor is the selection of the appropriate initiator. The initiator selection can have an impact on the reaction mechanism, causing it to follow either the NMRP or ATRP route. For example, if a NMRP initiator is used, the polymerisation reaction is more likely to follow an NMRP mechanism. 
Another factor that influences the reaction mechanism is the exposure of the initiator to light. The exposure of the NMRP initiator to light can result in the formation of carbenes that decrease the control over the polymerisation reaction. This could also lead to chain scission and branching. 
The combination of NMRP and ATRP initiators in the formation of polystyrene does not affect the independence of the two mechanisms significantly. The mechanism of each polymerisation route remains unaffected if the proper conditions are met. However, when the two techniques are combined, the sequence of reactions that occur in the process results in a hybrid polymer of NMRP and ATRP, which exhibits improved properties when compared to polymers formed by a single method. 
In conclusion, simultaneous use of NMRP and ATRP initiators in the formation of polystyrene has shown promise due to the benefits that are obtained from the two mechanisms. The outcomes of the combination include an increased rate of polymerisation, improved control over the reaction, and the production of high-quality, low-polydispersity polymers. Though the mechanisms of these techniques are different, the simultaneous use of initiators does not significantly affect the independence of each method. The selection of appropriate initiators and the prevention of light exposure can ensure the proper selection of polymerisation routes and enhance the quality of the resulting polystyrene. Thus, the simultaneous use of NMRP and ATRP initiators can be considered a viable alternative to produce high-quality polystyrene in the industry.
