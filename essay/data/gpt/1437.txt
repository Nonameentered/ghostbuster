Slavery and oppression were two of the most significant societal issues of the Romantic era in Europe, especially in Britain. Romantic poets such as William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Robert Southey, and William Cowper challenged popular opinions on slavery and oppression through their use of language. They employed various tropes, such as the noble savage and sensibility, to convey their messages effectively. Through their works, they highlighted the inhumanity of slavery and the dehumanizing effect of oppression on the oppressed. This essay aims to discuss the ways in which Romantic poets used language to challenge popular opinions on slavery and oppression, with a focus on Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, and Cowper. It will also explore how these poets differ in their approaches to discussing revolution and oppression in their works.
In the Romantic era, the concept of the "noble savage" was popularized, which involved portraying indigenous peoples and cultures as inherently good and pure, free from the corrupting influence of civilization. Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, and Cowper employed this trope to challenge the prevalent notions of the inferiority of African slaves. They portrayed the slaves as possessing the same nobility and virtue as the indigenous peoples, effectively challenging the stereotypes of African slaves as being uncivilized, animalistic, and inferior.
Wordsworth, in his poem "The Negro's Complaint," gives voice to a slave's experiences and highlights the emotional and psychological toll of slavery. It portrays the idea of the "noble savage" by describing the slave as having pure and innocent intentions, a quality associated with indigenous cultures. Wordsworth describes the slave as "whose fetters, grievous to be borne / Forbid my telling but my heart was torn" (Wordsworth 2-3). The use of the word "forbid" shows the emotional conflict and pain the slave experiences, which emphasizes the dehumanizing effect of slavery on the oppressed.
Similarly, in Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner," the character of the hermit, who embodies the "noble savage," re-humanizes the cursed sailors. Coleridge portrays the hermit as a natural and uncorrupted individual. He is unaffected by the guilt and sin of the sailors, and instead shows empathy and kindness towards them. Coleridge, through the character of the hermit, challenges the idea that the curse of sin is an innate characteristic of some humans.
Another trope frequently used by Romantic poets to challenge popular opinions on slavery and oppression is sensibility. This trope emphasizes the emotional and sentimental aspects of human nature, going beyond rationality. Southey, in his ballad "The Sailor, Who Had Served in the Slave Trade," explores how sensibility affects human morality. He transforms the character of Jonas, who was once a slave trader, by appealing to his ethical understanding and morality. The ballad portrays Jonas as having an emotional epiphany, having recognized his cruelty and inhumanity in dealing with the slaves. Jonas's transformation is made possible by his newfound sensitivity and awareness, which stems from his innate humanity. Southey, through Jonas's character, challenges the notion that individuals devoid of sensibility can treat others inhumanely.
In contrast to Southey's approach, Cowper, in his poem "The Negro's Complaint," accentuates the rationality and intellectual capacity of the slaves to convey their message. Cowper, instead of emphasizing the emotional impact of slavery, highlights the injustice and inhumanity of slavery by presenting logical arguments. The poem portrays the slaves as rational and intellectual individuals who have been mistreated unjustly by their oppressors. Cowper emphasizes the slaves' capacity for rational thinking, using reason as a tool to challenge slavery and oppression.
Moreover, while Romantic poets employed various tropes to challenge popular opinions on slavery and oppression, their approaches to discussing revolution and oppression differ. Wordsworth, in his poem "The Old Cumberland Beggar," highlights the need for revolution but emphasizes the importance of peaceful means of achieving change. The poem portrays the beggar as an outcast, subjected to the oppressive forces of society. Wordsworth argues that revolution against such oppression should be peaceful and non-violent. The poem highlights the importance of using societal structures to bring about meaningful societal changes.
On the other hand, Coleridge in "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" employs symbolism to convey a message of revolution. The poem's journey on the seas provides a metaphor for a revolution, where the sailors are the oppressed and the Mariner is the representative of the ruling class. The journey's perilousness shows that revolutionary action is necessary to change the existing power structures that oppress the working class. Coleridge portrays the Mariner as a symbol of revolutionary change, who through his experiences, transforms the sailors' attitudes towards the oppressed.
Southey, in his ballad "The Sailor, Who Had Served in the Slave Trade," challenges the notion of revolution and instead emphasizes moral transformation. Southey suggests that revolution, if it's not rooted in morality and virtue, will lead to similar injustices. Jonas's transformation is used as a way to illustrate Southey's belief that ethical and moral transformation is essential for meaningful societal changes to occur.
In contrast, Cowper's poem "The Negro's Complaint," highlights the need for revolution through a call to action. Cowper argues that slavery is an injustice that must be challenged through revolutionary means. The poem calls for revolutionary change, stating: "No, Freedom has a thousand charms / to wake the soul to action warm; / And 'tis the generous mind to prove / The noblest trophy of her love" (Cowper 24-27). Cowper emphasizes the need for revolutionary change and encourages all individuals to join together to challenge slavery and oppression.
In conclusion, Romantic poets, including Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey, and Cowper, employed various tropes to challenge popular opinions on slavery and oppression. They portrayed the oppressed as possessing the same nobility, virtue, and sensibility as the noble savage, challenging stereotypical notions of African slaves. Additionally, they utilized rationality and intellectual arguments to convey a strong message condemning slavery and oppression. Finally, while these poets had differing opinions on revolution and oppression, they highlighted the importance of societal change rooted in morality and virtue. The Romantics were influential in shaping societal attitudes towards slavery and oppression, and their works continue to challenge popular beliefs about these issues today.
