Dark matter, as the name implies, is a form of matter that is mysterious and enigmatic. It is called dark because it does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, such as light and radio waves. Dark matter only interacts via gravity, putting it beyond our reach to be measured directly. Despite this, the existence of dark matter is widely accepted in the scientific community. It is believed to make up over a quarter of the universe’s total mass-energy, and yet most people are unaware of its existence. In this essay, we will explore what dark matter is, how scientists know it exists, the proposed explanations for dark matter, how astronomers and particle physicists detect dark matter, and the challenges they face in understanding its composition.
Dark matter was first proposed in the 1930s by Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky, who noticed that the rotational speeds of galaxies in the Coma Cluster were much faster than expected, given the observable matter. The gravitational pull of visible matter, such as stars and gas, was not sufficient to explain the galaxies’ rotation speeds. Zwicky hypothesized that some invisible matter must be responsible for the unexpected rotational speeds and thus coined the term “dark matter.” Over time, other astrophysicists and astronomers built upon Zwicky’s ideas, including Vera Rubin, who studied the rotation curves of individual galaxies and found that they did not follow the same pattern as the visible mass. 
Today, scientists have several pieces of evidence that support the existence of dark matter. One piece is the gravitational lensing of distant objects by massive foreground galaxies or galaxy clusters. The gravity of these foreground objects can bend the light from objects behind them, allowing us to infer where the mass lies. The amount of bending matches the mass we see, plus additional mass from something invisible – a form of mass that behaves like dark matter. Another piece of evidence is the temperature and distribution of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which is radiation left over from the Big Bang. The CMB provides a snapshot of what the universe looked like around 380,000 years after the Big Bang. Astronomers observe tiny fluctuations in the CMB pattern representing the distribution of matter in the universe. These fluctuations can be used to determine the amount of matter in the universe. However, once again, the observed matter is not enough to explain the galaxies’ observed characteristics. Additional mass must be accounted for, and that mass must emit no light, leading to the belief that it is dark matter.
So, what could dark matter be made of? There are currently two leading hypotheses: Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). MACHOs are believed to be made up of baryonic matter, which means they contain protons, neutrons, and other particles found in everyday matter. These objects are thought to be in the form of brown dwarf stars, black holes, or planets. WIMPs, on the other hand, are non-baryonic particles that interact weakly with other matter. These particles have never been observed in a laboratory, and their properties are unknown. 
MACHOs were proposed as potential candidates for dark matter in the 1990s when observations of gravitational microlensing suggested that there were many more MACHOs in our galaxy than previously thought. However, in the following years, direct MACHO detection experiments could not find any evidence to support the MACHO hypothesis; astronomers have since ruled them out as the primary component of dark matter.
Today, the WIMP hypothesis is the most widely accepted explanation for dark matter, although they have yet to be directly detected. The WIMP hypothesis proposes that dark matter is made up of WIMPs, particles similar in mass to a proton, but otherwise entirely different. These particles are proposed as the potentially elusive weak force exchange particle. The weak force is one of the four fundamental forces of nature responsible for radioactive decay, which gives rise to properties such as beta decay from nuclear reactions. WIMPs do not interact with electromagnetic radiation, which is why we cannot see them, but they would interact via the weak force, making them weakly interacting. They are "massive" because they move at speeds much slower than the speed of light, unlike other particles that travel closer to the speed of light. 
Particle physicists are actively seeking new ways to detect WIMPs. Direct detection experiments involve looking for the very rare occasions when a WIMP happen to collide with heavy nuclei in underground detectors. These collisions often produce a detectable amount of radiation, meaning that indirect evidence of dark matter can be seen this way. For instance, detectors sensitive to different types of particle radiation can detect the neutrinos produced in WIMP annihilation, and astronomers can then look for these neutrinos in the universe or in subterranean experiments. So far, no direct detection has been confirmed, so the search continues.
Compared to the evidence suggesting the existence of dark matter, we know relatively little about its composition. The challenge of detecting dark matter lies in the fact that it does not interact directly with our measuring devices. Astronomical observations are an indirect way of detecting dark matter, and all the proposed particle detection experiments like WIMP or axion detection are yet to have concrete results. Nonetheless, scientists continually improve their methods to detect dark matter while simultaneously exploring more possibilities for its composition, such as axions.
In conclusion, dark matter is a mysterious and pervasive part of our universe. Despite being indirectly detected, the scientific evidence supports its existence. The Massive Compact Halo Object theory, which was initially favored, has since been rejected as our understanding of our galaxy’s properties and the distribution of mass has significantly advanced. Today, the WIMP theory has emerged as the most promising explanation for dark matter. While we are still uncertain about its exact composition, we are gradually developing new methods of finding dark matter and better investigating the possibilities for its composition. With the new technologies and improved experiments in the future, we may soon be able to solve one of the most prominent mysteries of our universe and gain a better understanding of the unseen, dark components that make it up.
