ISNAR, a division of IFPRI Learning and Capacity Strengthening (LCS), is an organization that specializes in adult learning and capacity strengthening. It aims to improve the capacity of individuals and organizations involved in agricultural research and development to achieve sustainable development in poor countries. ISNAR’s current learning approach for adult education is the result of years of research and experience and can be assessed based on various factors.
One of the key features of ISNAR’s approach to adult education is its use of problem-based learning (PBL) strategies. This approach focuses on the use of real-world problems to facilitate the learning process and encourage the application of knowledge in practical situations. This approach differs from traditional learning methods, which tend to focus on the acquisition of knowledge in a theoretical context. PBL is also characterized by active learning, which involves learners in their own learning process, decision making, and reflection. This is achieved through individual and group work, peer review, and feedback. The use of PBL has been shown to improve critical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and communication skills.
ISNAR also details learning outcomes through competency frameworks which provide an objective definition of what the student is expected to learn and what level of understanding they are supposed to have. Each framework is tailored to the specific field of study and is updated regularly to incorporate new developments and best practices in the field. Additionally, the organization provides online courses, in-person events, and blended learning options to accommodate different schedules.
However, ISNAR’s current approach to adult education has received some criticisms in the literature. One of the most significant criticisms is that there is no clear evidence of the impact of the learning interventions on the ground. Although ISNAR has been running adult education programs for decades, there is no clear evaluation system to gauge the effectiveness of the interventions. Another criticism is that there is a lack of focus on long-term capacity-building. While the organization has produced some innovative programs and materials, there is no clear strategy for scaling up these approaches or ensuring their sustained impact beyond the duration of the programs.
There are several suggestions for improving ISNAR’s approach to adult education. Firstly, the organization could set up a rigorous evaluation system that measures the impact of the learning interventions on the ground. This evaluation system could be integrated into all learning interventions to help identify areas where interventions are most effective and where further improvements are needed. Secondly, there should be a focus on long-term capacity building, which involves promoting continuous learning, mentoring, and support over an extended period. Thirdly, ISNAR could develop more innovative programs and materials that incorporate emerging technologies and cutting-edge practices.
Training professionals linked to capacity strengthening can also be encouraged to change their attitudes towards short-term training programs. One approach to promoting change in attitudes is to highlight the benefits of capacity strengthening in terms of both the professional and personal development of individuals and the impact on the life conditions of poor countries. Short-term training programs are a starting point for future learning and developments, which can be pursued in the long term with sustained support and investment.
Another approach is to develop customized needs assessments and a training plan that is tailored to the specific capacities required. The assessment should be conducted at the organizational level and should involve key stakeholders who provide input on the topic, objectives, and methods that should be included in the learning interventions. Professional trainers can use this approach to design learning interventions that enhance the critical skills required for effective execution of projects.
In addition, professional training can be provided by experts in various fields across different geographical locations. This approach ensures that the training is accessible and provides exposure to experiences beyond the trainee’s context or usual circle of colleagues.
Finally, Capacity strengthening processes must have incentives for professionals to invest in life-long learning endeavors. Recognition of achievements that culminate in certification can be an important motivator. In some cultures, working with academically trained professionals can be a source of pride and prestige that motivates individuals to seek formal training and professional development opportunities.
Overall, ISNAR’s approach to adult education has several strengths, but there is room for improvement. The inclusion of long-term capacity building, innovative program development, a focus on outcomes, and an effective evaluation system are necessary for significant progress to occur. Trainers can motivate professionals linked to training and capacity strengthening by customizing learning interventions, providing exposure, delivering the training where it can be attended from different locations, and recognition of achievements leading to certification. These combined interventions would help change mindsets towards lifelong learning to improve the life conditions of poor countries.
