Introduction
Globalization, an unstoppable phenomenon, has had a significant impact on businesses worldwide. The global market is changing rapidly, with new market opportunities emerging every day. In the UK supermarket industry, globalization has created numerous changes in the operations and growth of Nationwide Supermarkets. External factors such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union have played a significant role in the changes experienced in Nationwide Supermarkets. This essay aims to explore how external factors have affected the operations and growth of Nationwide Supermarket in the UK, focusing on the regional trade agreements and how NAFTA and CAP have contributed to these changes.
Overview
Nationwide Supermarket is a UK-based supermarket chain that was established in the late 1960s. Since then, the company has grown and expanded, with over 500 stores worldwide and more than 300 in the UK. The supermarket chain has a diverse product range, including food, clothing, electronics, and household appliances. However, since the advent of globalization, the supermarket industry has experienced various changes in market conditions, and external factors such as trade policies have affected the operations and growth of Nationwide Supermarket.
Globalization
Globalization has created a new era of competition, and companies are now competing on a global scale. The rise of multinational companies has also created a new wave of opportunities and challenges for businesses such as Nationwide Supermarket. Globalization has opened markets and created opportunities for companies to expand their operations globally (Giddens, 1990). However, it has also created challenges, such as increased competition from multinational companies, changes in consumer preferences, and new market requirements, among others.
Trade agreements and their impact on Nationwide Supermarket
Trade agreements such as NAFTA and CAP have had a significant impact on the operations and growth of Nationwide Supermarket. These agreements have created opportunities for Nationwide Supermarket to expand its product range and access new markets. However, they have also created challenges, such as increased competition, changing market conditions, and challenges to the UK agricultural sector.
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
NAFTA is a trade agreement that was signed in 1994 between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The agreement was designed to reduce trade barriers and create a free trade zone in North America. The impact of NAFTA on Nationwide Supermarket has been significant. The agreement has created new market opportunities for the supermarket chain, particularly in the food and beverage sector. The elimination of trade barriers has made it easier for Nationwide Supermarket to import and export products to and from North America (Bown, 2016).
Impact on the food and beverage sector
The elimination of tariff barriers has enabled Nationwide Supermarket to access North American food products such as beef, poultry, and pork. This has resulted in increased competition for UK-based farmers and producers. The availability of imported North American food products has created a new market segment for Nationwide Supermarket. As a result, the company has diversified its product range to include North American food products. However, this has raised concerns about the quality of the imported food products and their effects on the UK's agricultural sector.
Impact on the UK agricultural sector
NAFTA has created competition for UK-based farmers and producers. The elimination of tariff barriers has enabled North American producers to access the UK market more easily. This has created challenges for UK farmers and producers who face stiff competition from more efficient and cheaper North American producers. It has also raised concerns about the quality of imported food products, particularly in light of the UK's strict food and safety regulations.
The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union
CAP is a European Union policy that was introduced in 1962 to support farmers and promote agriculture in the EU. The policy provides subsidies and financial support to EU farmers to enable them to produce food efficiently and meet environmental standards (European Commission, 2021). The impact of CAP on Nationwide Supermarket has been significant. The policy has created opportunities for Nationwide Supermarket to source agricultural products from the EU.
Opportunities
CAP has created opportunities for Nationwide Supermarket to source agricultural products from the EU at subsidized prices. The policy has enabled EU farmers to produce food efficiently and meet environmental standards, resulting in high-quality products. This has enabled Nationwide Supermarket to diversify its product range and offer customers a wider variety of products. The availability of high-quality agricultural products has enabled Nationwide Supermarket to enhance its brand value and customer loyalty.
Challenges
CAP has also created challenges for Nationwide Supermarket. The policy has created competition for UK farmers and producers who face stiff competition from more efficient and cheaper EU farmers. The policy has also resulted in the overproduction of some agricultural products, leading to declining prices and income for farmers. This has resulted in an increase in the number of bankruptcies among farmers, which has created social problems in some regions (European Commission, 2021).
Conclusion
In conclusion, the global market is changing rapidly, and the supermarket industry is experiencing various changes in market conditions. External factors such as trade policies have affected the operations and growth of Nationwide Supermarkets. NAFTA and CAP have played a significant role in the changes experienced in Nationwide Supermarkets. The elimination of tariff barriers has enabled Nationwide Supermarket to access North American food products and has created a new market segment for the supermarket chain. However, this has created challenges for UK-based farmers and producers who face stiff competition from cheaper and more efficient North American producers.
Similarly, the impact of CAP on Nationwide Supermarket has been significant, and the policy has created opportunities for the supermarket chain to source high-quality agricultural products at subsidized prices. However, it has also created challenges for UK farmers and producers who face competition from more efficient and cheaper EU farmers. Overall, external factors such as globalization and regional trade agreements have played a significant role in the changes experienced in Nationwide Supermarkets, and the supermarket chain has to adapt its operations to remain competitive and maintain its market share.
