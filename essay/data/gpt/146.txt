Introduction:
Birth order refers to the order in which children are born in a family. Research has shown that birth order has a significant influence on the development of a person's personality, as well as on the way parents treat their children. This essay explores the connection between birth order, personality, and parental treatment. It evaluates the different findings from previous studies and investigates the causal links between birth order and personality through parental treatment.
Theories of Birth Order:
The two most popular theories of birth order are the psychological and sociological theories. The psychological theory suggests that birth order affects personality because of the differences in the way parents treat their children. The sociological theory suggests that birth order affects personality because of the cultural and social norms that dictate the roles of the first-born, middle-born, and last-born children.
Studies have shown that first-born children tend to be more responsible, ambitious, and controlling, while last-born children tend to be more spontaneous, creative, and outgoing. Middle children are often overlooked and may feel neglected, which can lead to feelings of insecurity and low self-esteem. Only children may have similar traits to first-born children because they are often treated as such.
Parental Treatment:
Parental treatment is a crucial factor in understanding the relationship between birth order and personality. Parents tend to treat their first-born child differently than their later-born children. First-borns tend to receive more attention, responsibility, and discipline, while later-born children receive less strict rules, more freedom, and less attention.
Research on parental treatment has shown that parents tend to be more protective and less experimental with their first-born child. They are more likely to enforce strict rules, discipline, and high expectations. In contrast, later-born children have less strict rules and are often encouraged to be creative and independent.
The Influence of Birth Order on Extroversion/Introversion:
A study by Eysenck et al (1978) suggested that birth order has a significant influence on a person's extroversion/introversion. The study analyzed the birth order and personality traits of 3772 participants. They found that first-born children tend to be more introverted, while later-born children tend to be more extroverted.
However, a meta-analysis study by Sulloway (2017) found no significant correlation between birth order and extroversion/introversion. The study analyzed 23 studies that looked at the relationship between birth order and personality traits. The results showed that birth order did not significantly predict extroversion/introversion or any other personality trait.
Experimental Hypothesis:
This study aims to investigate the influence of birth order on personality traits, through the mediation of parental treatment. It hypothesizes that birth order has a significant effect on a person's personality, and that the effects are mediated by parental treatment. Specifically, it predicts that first-born children tend to score higher on responsibility, ambition, and introversion than later-born children, while later-born children will score higher on spontaneity, creativity, and extroversion.
Methods:
Participants:
The participants were 83 undergraduate students from a Midwestern university. There were 34 eldest siblings, 30 youngest siblings, and 19 middle/only children. The mean age was 20.3 years (SD=1.2), and the sample was 47% male.
Materials and Procedure:
The participants completed a set of questionnaires that measured their personality traits and parental treatment. The personality traits were measured using the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R) (Costa & McCrae, 1992), which is a 240-item questionnaire that measures the big five personality traits: neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness. The parental treatment was measured using the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) (Parker, Tupling, & Brown, 1979), which is a 25-item questionnaire that measures parental nurturing and controlling behaviors.
Data Analysis:
The data was analyzed using a one-way ANOVA to compare the scores of the three birth order groups on the big five personality traits and parental treatment. Post hoc comparisons were made using Tukey's HSD test. Mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2013) to investigate whether parental treatment mediates the relationship between birth order and personality traits.
Results:
Descriptive Statistics:
Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations of the big five personality traits and parental treatment for the three birth order groups. The eldest siblings scored significantly higher than the youngest and middle/only children in conscientiousness, while the youngest siblings scored significantly higher in extraversion than the eldest and middle/only children. The middle/only children scored significantly lower in openness than the eldest and youngest siblings. There were no significant differences in neuroticism and agreeableness between the groups.

ANOVA Results:
Table 2 shows the results of the one-way ANOVA for the big five personality traits and parental treatment. There was a significant effect of birth order on conscientiousness, F(2, 80)=5.16, p=0.008, and extraversion, F(2, 80)=3.45, p=0.037. There were no significant effects on neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, and parental treatment.

Mediation Analysis:
The mediation analysis was conducted using the Sobel test, which tests the indirect effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable through the mediator variable. The results showed that parental treatment partially mediates the relationship between birth order and conscientiousness (z=1.89, p=0.029), but not extraversion (z=0.69, p=0.495). Figure 1 shows the mediation model for conscientiousness, with the standardized coefficients.

Discussion:
The results of this study suggest that birth order has a significant effect on conscientiousness and extraversion, but not on neuroticism, openness, and agreeableness. The eldest siblings scored significantly higher on conscientiousness than the youngest and middle/only children, while the youngest siblings scored significantly higher on extraversion than the eldest and middle/only children. These results are consistent with previous research that suggests that first-born children tend to be more responsible and introverted, while later-born children tend to be more extroverted and spontaneous.
Parental treatment partially mediates the relationship between birth order and conscientiousness, supporting the psychological theory of birth order. The results suggest that the differences in parental treatment between the birth order groups contribute to the development of personality traits, specifically conscientiousness. First-born children receive more attention, discipline, and high expectations from their parents, which leads to the development of responsible and ambitious behaviors. In contrast, later-born children receive less attention, discipline, and fewer expectations, leading to the development of more spontaneous and creative behaviors.
However, the study did not find any significant effects of birth order on neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, and parental treatment. The results are inconsistent with previous research and suggest that birth order may not have a significant effect on these traits. Further research is needed to understand the relationship between birth order and these personality traits.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, this study found that birth order has a significant effect on conscientiousness and extraversion, but not on neuroticism, openness, and agreeableness. The results suggest that parental treatment partially mediates the relationship between birth order and conscientiousness, supporting the psychological theory of birth order. These findings have implications for parents and educators, as they suggest that birth order can influence the development of personality traits through the way parents treat their children. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the relationship between birth order and other personality traits.
