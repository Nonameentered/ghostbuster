Introduction:
Before evaluating the substantive arguments for judicial review, it is essential to consider the procedural issues. The procedural issues play a crucial role in determining the validity and legality of the decision made by the authorities. The procedural issues are generally concerned with the process or methodology used to make the decision and ensure that the procedural fairness and legitimacy of the decision-making are not compromised. These five procedural issues can be categorized into Standing, Arguable Case, Jurisdiction, Fairness, and Legitimate Expectations. This essay will explore the procedural issues that need to be considered before evaluating the substantive arguments for judicial review and how these issues apply to a case involving the expulsion of students from a state school for drug use. In particular, it will focus on the requirements for standing and an arguable case and how the rules of fairness and legitimate expectations apply to the decision-making process of the school disciplinary panel.
Standing and Arguable Case:
Before initiating a judicial review, the applicant must establish standing and an arguable case. Standing implies that the applicant has a sufficient interest or has been affected by the decision in question. In other words, the applicant must have a direct stake in the matter. In the case of school expulsion, the affected students have the standing to bring a judicial review. The students can argue that the decision to expel them from the school has a direct impact on their future education and career prospects. Thus, they have a legal interest in the matter and can apply for a judicial review.
However, establishing standing alone is not sufficient to bring a judicial review. The applicant must also demonstrate an arguable case, which means that there is a real prospect of success in the judicial review. The applicant must argue that there is a legal basis for challenging the decision. In the case of school expulsion, the students can argue that the decision was unlawful, irrational, biased, or procedurally unfair. The students can challenge the decision on the grounds that the evidence against them was insufficient, or the decision was based on hearsay or unreliable witnesses. The students can argue that the decision was irrational because the punishment was disproportionate to the offense. The students can also argue that the decision was biased because the panel had a preconceived notion of their guilt and did not consider their defense.
Jurisdiction:
Jurisdiction is another crucial procedural issue that needs to be considered before the judicial review. The jurisdiction of the court or tribunal determines whether it has the power to hear and determine the matter. In the case of school expulsion, the jurisdiction of the court or tribunal depends on the nature of the decision. If the decision is administrative or quasi-judicial, it can be challenged by way of judicial review. However, if the decision is purely academic or discretionary, it may not be open to challenge.
In the case of school expulsion, the decision of the disciplinary panel is administrative or quasi-judicial. The panel had the power to make a decision on the basis of the evidence presented before it. The panel's decision had a direct impact on the future education and career prospects of the expelled students. Therefore, the decision is open to challenge by way of judicial review.
Fairness:
Fairness is another crucial procedural issue that needs to be considered before the judicial review. The rules of natural justice require that the decision-making process should be fair and impartial. The fair and impartial decision-making process is necessary to ensure that the decision is just and reasonable. The rules of natural justice require that the decision-maker should act without bias or preconceived notions, and hear both sides of the argument before making the decision.
In the case of school expulsion, the disciplinary panel had the responsibility to ensure that the decision-making process was fair and impartial. The panel should have heard both sides of the argument before making the decision. The panel should have ensured that the students had a fair opportunity to present their defenses and challenge the evidence against them. The panel should have acted without any bias or preconceived notions and should have considered the evidence objectively.
Legitimate Expectations:
Legitimate expectations are another crucial procedural issue that needs to be considered before the judicial review. The legitimate expectations principle states that the decision-making authority must act fairly and reasonably to fulfill the reasonable expectations of the affected parties. The principle of legitimate expectations arises where the authority has created a legitimate expectation, and it would be unfair to disappoint that expectation.
In the case of school expulsion, the students may argue that they had a legitimate expectation of a fair and unbiased hearing and that the disciplinary panel failed to meet that expectation. Alternatively, the students may argue that they had a legitimate expectation that the punishment for drug use would be proportionate and that the expulsion was disproportionate punishment for the offense. Therefore, the legitimate expectations principle can be invoked to challenge the expulsion.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the procedural issues that need to be considered before evaluating the substantive arguments for judicial review are crucial in determining the validity and legality of the decision made by the authorities. The standing and arguable case, jurisdiction, fairness, and legitimate expectations are the major procedural issues that are required to be analyzed before initiating a judicial review. In the case of school expulsion, the affected students have standing to bring a judicial review and can argue that the decision was unlawful, irrational, biased, or procedurally unfair. The jurisdiction of the court or tribunal determines whether it has the power to hear and determine the matter. The rules of natural justice require that the decision-making process should be fair and impartial. Finally, legitimate expectations principles arise where the authority has created a legitimate expectation, and it would be unfair to disappoint that expectation.
