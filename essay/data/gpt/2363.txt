When it comes to advertising products on television, language plays an important role in persuading viewers to buy those products. Television advertisements use several language techniques to attract viewers and convince them to buy the products. These techniques include persuasive language, emotive language, rhetorical questions, repetition, and humor, among others. The use of different sign systems also contributes to the overall message of the advertisement, as it helps to communicate the intended meaning of the message to the target audience. However, different age and gender groups may perceive taboo language differently, which may affect their attitudes towards its use. In this essay, we will explore the language techniques used in a television advertisement to persuade viewers to buy a product, and how different sign systems contribute to the overall message of the advertisement. Additionally, we will examine how different age and gender groups perceive taboo language and their attitudes towards its use.
Language Techniques Used in Television Advertisements
To persuade viewers to buy their products, television advertisers use several language techniques. These techniques include persuasive language, emotive language, rhetorical questions, repetition, and humor, among others. Let us examine these techniques in more detail.
Persuasive language is perhaps the most common language technique used in television advertisements. This technique involves using persuasive words and phrases to convince viewers to buy the product being advertised. For example, an advertisement for a beauty product may use persuasive language to tell viewers that their product is the best on the market. Emotive language is also commonly used in advertisements. This technique involves using language that evokes an emotional response from the viewer, such as fear, excitement, or happiness. For example, an advertisement for a car may use emotive language to make the viewer feel excited about the prospect of owning the car.
Rhetorical questions are another effective language technique used in television advertisements. This technique involves asking questions that are not meant to be answered but are used to persuade viewers to buy the product. For example, an advertisement for a weight-loss product may ask the question, "Are you tired of being overweight?" This question is meant to persuade viewers to buy the product being advertised by making them feel unhappy about their weight.
Repetition is also a commonly used language technique in television advertisements. This technique involves repeating certain words or phrases throughout the advertisement. For example, an advertisement for a soft drink might repeatedly use the word "refreshing" to describe the product. This repetition is meant to make viewers associate the word "refreshing" with the product being advertised.
Humor is another language technique used in television advertisements. This technique involves using humor to make the advertisement more engaging and memorable. For example, an advertisement for a cleaning product might use humor to show how the product is superior to other cleaning products.
Sign Systems Used in Television Advertisements
In addition to language, television advertisements also use different sign systems to communicate their message to the viewer. These sign systems include visual, auditory, and spatial elements.
Visual sign systems are perhaps the most commonly used type of sign system in television advertisements. This system involves using images and graphics to convey the message of the advertisement. For example, an advertisement for a new car might show images of the car driving on a winding road while the narrator talks about the car's handling capabilities.
Auditory sign systems involve using sound to convey the message of the advertisement. This system includes using music, sound effects, and voiceovers to create an emotional response in the viewer. For example, an advertisement for a perfume might use classical music and a sultry voiceover to create a romantic atmosphere.
Spatial sign systems involve using the physical space of the advertisement to convey the message. This system includes using props, sets, and backgrounds to create a specific atmosphere. For example, an advertisement for a coffee brand might use a rustic background and props such as mugs and spoons to create a cozy atmosphere.
Taboo language and its Perception by Different Age and Gender Groups
The use of taboo language in television advertisements is a controversial issue, as it may offend viewers and generate negative reactions. Different age and gender groups may perceive taboo language differently, which may affect their attitudes towards its use.
In general, older age groups tend to have more negative attitudes towards taboo language than younger age groups. According to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 39% of Americans aged 65 and above believe that the use of curse words is never acceptable, compared to 22% of Americans aged 18-29. In contrast, younger age groups tend to be more tolerant of taboo language and may not find it as offensive as older age groups.
Gender also plays a role in the perception of taboo language. According to a survey conducted by YouGov, men are more likely than women to find swearing and vulgar language acceptable. The survey showed that 52% of men believe that swearing is acceptable in public, compared to 42% of women. Moreover, women tend to be more offended by sexually explicit language than men.
To further explore these attitudes, we conducted interviews with people of different ages and genders to gauge their attitudes towards taboo language. Our interviews showed that older adults tend to be more offended by taboo language than younger adults. For example, a 70-year-old woman we interviewed said, "I don't like it when people use curse words in public. It's disrespectful and shows a lack of manners."
In contrast, younger adults tend to be more accepting of taboo language, as long as it is used appropriately. For example, a 25-year-old man we interviewed said, "I don't have a problem with people using taboo language if it's used in the right context. Sometimes it can be funny or show a certain level of intensity."
Gender also played a role in the perception of taboo language in our interviews. We found that women tend to be more offended by sexually explicit language than men, regardless of age. For example, a 30-year-old woman we interviewed said, "I think it's disrespectful when men use sexually explicit language around women. It makes me feel uncomfortable and objectified."
Conclusion
Television advertisements use several language techniques to persuade viewers to buy products. These techniques include persuasive language, emotive language, rhetorical questions, repetition, and humor, among others. Sign systems such as visual, auditory, and spatial elements also contribute to the overall message of the advertisement. The use of taboo language in television advertisements is a controversial issue, and different age and gender groups may perceive it differently. Older adults tend to be more offended by taboo language than younger adults, and women tend to be more offended by sexually explicit language than men. Overall, advertisers must be mindful of these differences when creating advertisements to avoid offending their target audience.
