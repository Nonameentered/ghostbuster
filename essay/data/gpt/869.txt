Throughout history, poets have communicated their perspectives on various themes through the use of language, including love and relationships. Armitage and Wilmot are no exception, using their distinctive writing styles to express their thoughts and emotions on these topics. This essay will compare and contrast how Armitage and Wilmot utilize language to convey their views on love and relationships.
Simon Armitage's poem "Poem" illustrates love as something that takes place silently, without any grand gestures or displays of affection. He describes love as "not a fancy bouquet" or a "red candle," but instead is a "self-effacing shrug." This line suggests that love is not something that can be easily understood or put into words, as it is a subtle and perhaps unremarkable feeling. In contrast, Wilmot's "Love the Invisible Fiction" portrays love as a powerful and intense force, stating that his lover is "drenched in blood and cum and trembling / with ejaculatory cries." This vivid imagery conveys a sense of passion and intensity, indicating that love can be a fierce and captivating feeling.
In addition to their differing portrayals of love, Armitage and Wilmot also differ in their attitudes toward relationships. Armitage suggests that relationships are complex and can be difficult to navigate. He states, "Don't think I'm not holding you, / they say," indicating a sense of tension or uncertainty in the relationship. In contrast, Wilmot's "The Second Coming" emphasizes the importance of finding a partner and settling down in a relationship. He writes, "We need someone who believes in / something other than what we do," indicating that relationships can provide a sense of stability and support.
Furthermore, both poets utilize figurative language to convey their views on love and relationships. Armitage and Wilmot both use metaphor to express their ideas, but Armitage's metaphors are often more subtle. In "Poem," Armitage suggests that love is like a "hedgehog" that remains "curled up tight until the threat / of danger has gone." This metaphor conveys a sense of vulnerability and protection, suggesting that love can be a refuge from harm. Wilmot, on the other hand, employs more explicit and provocative metaphors, such as in "The Second Coming," where he describes his lover as "a sacrificial lamb on the altar of / my feelings." This metaphor highlights the intensity of his emotions and perhaps suggests that relationships can be sacrificial in nature.
Another technique used by both poets is repetition, which helps to emphasize certain themes and ideas. Armitage's use of repetition in "Poem" with the phrase "it was" serves to emphasize the subtlety of love and reinforces the idea that it is a feeling that cannot easily be put into words. Wilmot, on the other hand, repeats the phrase "I am the one" in "The Second Coming," which emphasizes his desire for a partner and his conviction that his lover is the right one for him.
Finally, both poets use tone to convey their attitudes toward love and relationships. Armitage's tone in "Poem" is subdued and contemplative, suggesting that he is reflecting on the nature of love. Wilmot's tone in "The Second Coming," however, is more assertive and confident, indicating his determination to find a partner who shares his beliefs.
In conclusion, both Armitage and Wilmot use language in unique ways to convey their views on love and relationships. While Armitage portrays love as a subtle and unremarkable feeling that can be difficult to understand, Wilmot portrays it as an intense and captivating force that can provide stability and support in a relationship. Their use of figurative language, repetition, and tone all serve to emphasize their differing perspectives on these themes. Ultimately, both poets demonstrate the power of language to evoke complex emotions and ideas, showing that love and relationships remain a timeless and universal source of inspiration and reflection.
