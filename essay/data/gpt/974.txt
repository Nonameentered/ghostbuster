The Gothic genre has been a significant literary movement, providing a platform for women to express their experiences and emotions. The rise of Gothic fiction in the late 18th and early 19th centuries was a significant socio-historic development as it provided a space for female writers to express their fears, desires and experiences through the lenses of horror, fantasy and romance. The Gothic genre privileged the experiences of women by challenging the patriarchal norms of society, offering the opportunity for female protagonists to take center stage, and revealing the psychological, physical and emotional complexities of being a woman. The Gothic is unique in its engagement with both the uncanny and homely terrors, which speak to female experiences of domesticity, motherhood, sexuality, and the supernatural. This essay will analyze the socio-historical context of the rise of Gothic fiction, the role of female Gothic writers, and the significance of the Gothic heroine in female subjectivity.
The origins of Gothic fiction can be traced back to the late 18th century, a time of changing social and political structures in Britain. The emergence of Gothic fiction was a reaction to the Enlightenment and the newfound rationality that had been embraced by society. The Gothic represented a return to the dark and mysterious, where superstition and the supernatural took center stage. The Gothic was also a response to the changing roles of women in society, and it provided a platform for female writers to engage with the fears and desires of their gender. Female Gothic writers such as Ann Radcliffe, Mary Shelley, and Clara Reeve used the genre to explore female repression, sexuality, and the complexities of motherhood and domesticity.
Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) is a classic Gothic text that emphasizes the role of women as both vulnerable and powerful. The novel's protagonist, Emily St. Aubert, is a victim of patriarchal oppression, yet she finds strength in her resilience and motivation to escape her captors. Radcliffe's novel portrays the importance of rationality and reason while also engaging with the uncanny terror of the supernatural. Similarly, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818) examines the role of women in a scientific world, questioning the prevailing views of motherhood, sexuality, and domesticity. Shelley's novel is deeply psychological, investigating the human condition and exploring the notion of what it means to be human.
The Gothic genre is unique in its portrayal of the heroine, and it has an important role to play in female subjectivity. The Gothic heroine is often conflicted, caught between her desires and societal expectations, and her journey towards self-discovery allows other women to explore their own complex identities. Gothic heroines are women who challenge the patriarchal expectations by expressing their sexuality, agency, and independence. Their narratives are centered around their journey from victim to agent, and they often overcome extreme adversity in the process. For example, in Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho, Emily St. Aubert is a victim of patriarchal oppression, but she eventually escapes from her captors and asserts her independence. Similarly, in Bronte's Jane Eyre (1847), Jane overcomes her social class limitations, asserts her agency and ultimately finds personal and emotional fulfillment.
The Gothic genre's use of the 'uncanny' and homely terrors, which speak to female experiences of domesticity, motherhood, sexuality, and the supernatural, generate extreme feelings at the core of the genre's extraordinary plots. The Gothic genre is renowned for its engagement with the uncanny, which refers to the unsettling and inexplicable occurings in the story that cannot be rationally explained. Gothic literature is frequently set in castles, monasteries, Gothic mansions with winding staircases, secret passages, and dark recesses, providing a tangible sense of the uncanny. For instance, in Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca (1938), the 'uncanny' motif is prevalent throughout the story with Rebecca's ghost haunting the new bride, as well as the mysterious housekeeper Mrs. Danvers who reveals top secrets about the past owner of the mansion that threatens to destroy the new bride's life. The genre's engagement with homely terrors is also significant in the way it portrays the daily experiences of women on the home front.
Feminist criticism of the Gothic has been ongoing, with some scholars arguing that Gothic heroines are not submissive but instead portray women as empowered beings in their quest for independence. On the other hand, critics like feminist scholar Ellen Moers argue that the genre's heroines are often submissive and promote a flawed model to readers. This debate is complicated, but it is important to recognize the importance of Gothic literature in its representation of female experiences, which can inform debates on feminism and women's rights.
In conclusion, the Gothic genre has significant importance in women's literature, as it provides women with a platform to voice their desires, fears, and experiences. The genre has evolved over time, but the analysis of its socio-historical context, its representation of heroines and the importance of the uncanny and homely terrors give insight into the genre's profound impact on women's subjectivity. The Gothic continues to resonate in contemporary literature, with modern-day Gothic writers redefining the term by considering it as a separate literary genre called 'Female Gothic.' Through the Gothic, women have been able to engage with their fears, desires and emotions in a way that has challenged the patriarchal society and opened new doors for female empowerment.
