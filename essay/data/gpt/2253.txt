The aim of the project is to develop a mobile application that can be used on both a PDA and a PC to assist hikers in navigating through difficult terrains. The application is designed to provide an accurate compass and horizon screen using advanced algorithms and sensors, ensuring that hikers are safe and able to reach their destination without getting lost.
The application will work by utilizing the sensors on both the PDA and the PC to track the hikerâ€™s movements and provide accurate orientation information. It will also use GPS and other mapping technologies to provide route guidance and notification of possible hazards on the hiking trail. When used on a PC, the application will function as a web application and provide the same capabilities as the mobile app.
Several existing products were analyzed during the preliminary stages of the project. However, the proposed application stands out for its unique features such as a more accurate compass and horizon display, real-time tracking, and notification of nearby attractions or services tailored to the user's preferences. 
Since the inception of the project, significant progress has been achieved in completing several essential features, such as orientation tracking, altitude measurement, and integration with GPS data. The team is currently focusing on creating an easy-to-use and intuitive user interface that can be accessed through different devices. 
Changes have been made to the project since the preliminary report to incorporate new functionalities, improve existing features, and fix any bugs found during the testing phase. The project team is confident that the development is progressing as planned, and they expect to complete the project within the given time frame.
The PDA application is running efficiently, and the team has adhered to the best coding practices and employed the latest technologies to maintain high performance. Any issues identified during testing have been addressed promptly, and the application has been thoroughly tested to ensure it is functional and reliable.
One critical aspect of the application is the accuracy of the horizon, which is essential for hikers using the app to navigate through rough terrains. To ensure that the horizon is accurate, the project team performed various tests using different sensors. The tests showed that the horizon's accuracy was within acceptable limits, ensuring hikers can navigate through challenging environments with confidence.
In conclusion, the project's aim is to develop a mobile application that can assist hikers in navigating difficult terrains using advanced algorithms and sensors that provide accurate compass and horizon information. The application will be available on both PC and PDA, providing a seamless experience for users. The existing products were analyzed to come up with unique features, and the project has made considerable progress towards achieving its goals. Changes have been made to incorporate new functionalities, improve existing ones, and fix bugs. The PDA application is running efficiently, and the horizon's accuracy is within acceptable limits after thorough testing. Overall, the project is on track, and the team is confident in meeting all the objectives within the given timeframe.
