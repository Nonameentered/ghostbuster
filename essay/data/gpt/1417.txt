The Cape Town Principles defines a child soldier as any person under the age of 18 who is used for any purpose in an armed conflict, including but not limited to combat, support roles, cooking, or administrative duties. According to the principles, the use of child soldiers is considered a grave violation of human rights and international law.
The recruitment of child soldiers often involves coercion, abduction, or false promises of education and job opportunities. Children are also vulnerable to recruitment due to poverty, displacement, or a desire to protect their communities from violence.
Once recruited, child soldiers are often subjected to harsh training and indoctrination, including the use of drugs and violence. They are used in combat and support roles, including as porters, spies, and human shields. Many child soldiers also experience physical and emotional abuse, including sexual violence.
Overall, the Cape Town Principles emphasize the need to protect children from the harmful effects of armed conflicts, including their recruitment and use in hostilities. States and non-state actors are encouraged to implement measures to prevent the use of child soldiers, and to provide rehabilitation and reintegration support to those who have been affected.
