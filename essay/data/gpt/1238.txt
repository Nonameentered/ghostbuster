In today's media-driven world, the news is an indispensable part of our lives. The British media landscape is no different, with a vast array of newspapers catering to diverse interest groups. Two of the most prominent newspapers are the broadsheet newspaper The Guardian and the tabloid newspaper The Mirror. These newspapers have different approaches to news reporting, as reflected in the difference in the use of superlative adjectives. This essay will elucidate the difference in the use of superlative adjectives between The Guardian and The Mirror, particularly in regards to their reporting on former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy.
The Guardian and The Mirror are two newspapers with different political affiliations. The Guardian is a center-left broadsheet newspaper, while The Mirror is a center-left tabloid newspaper. The difference in their political affiliations is also reflected in their editorial policies and coverage of news, which in turn affects the use of superlative adjectives. When it comes to covering stories on Charles Kennedy, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats, who died in 2015, The Guardian used a more measured tone, while The Mirror was more sensationalist.
The Guardian's reporting on Charles Kennedy was characterized by a more informative and factual approach. The newspaper focused on highlighting Kennedy's achievements as a politician and his contributions to public life. For instance, in an article published after his death, The Guardian describes Kennedy as "a big beast in the Scottish political landscape" (The Guardian, 2 June 2015). This choice of words is significant in that it portrays Kennedy as a towering figure in Scottish politics. It is also a superlative adjective that is not sensationalist but factual.
The Guardian's focus was on Kennedy's achievements and how his career impacted people's lives. Rather than sensationalizing his personal struggles, the newspaper highlighted Kennedy's contributions to the political discourse and how he challenged the status quo. For instance, the newspaper notes that "His opposition to the Iraq war and the Blair government's plans for identity cards were courageous stands" (The Guardian, 2 June 2015). The use of the word "courageous" highlights Kennedy's political convictions and his willingness to risk his political career to stand up for what he believed was right. It is not a sensationalist adjective but one that captures Kennedy's true nature as a politician.
On the other hand, The Mirror's reporting on Charles Kennedy was more sensationalist, with the newspaper focusing on his personal struggles rather than his political achievements. The newspaper ran several articles highlighting Kennedy's alcoholism and his difficulties in dealing with it. For instance, one article published in 2006, during Kennedy's stint as party leader, read "Charles Kennedy has admitted his drink problem is 'serious' and revealed he has been to rehab" (The Mirror, 6 January 2006). The use of the word "serious" in this case is a superlative adjective that captures the severity of Kennedy's alcoholism. However, it is also a sensationalist word that focuses on Kennedy's personal struggles rather than his political achievements.
Furthermore, The Mirror's reporting on Kennedy's personal struggles relied heavily on anonymous sources and gossip. For instance, in another article published in 2006, the newspaper quoted an anonymous source as saying "Charles can go for weeks without touching a drop, then he'll fall off the wagon and it can be pretty bad" (The Mirror, 9 January 2006). Such articles are not only sensationalist but also lack credibility as they rely on anonymous sources and hearsay.
The difference in the use of superlative adjectives between The Guardian and The Mirror is also reflected in their approach to news reporting. The Guardian's reporting is characterized by depth and analysis, with the newspaper focusing on providing a comprehensive understanding of the issue at hand. This approach is evident in their coverage of Charles Kennedy's death, where the newspaper focused on his political achievements and how they impacted people's lives. On the other hand, The Mirror's reporting is characterized by a more simplistic approach, with the newspaper relying heavily on headlines and sensationalism to attract readers. This approach is evident in their coverage of Kennedy's personal struggles, which the newspaper highlighted to attract readers' attention.
In conclusion, the difference in the use of superlative adjectives between The Guardian and The Mirror is a reflection of their approach to news reporting, which is shaped by their political affiliations, editorial policies, and target audiences. The Guardian's reporting on Charles Kennedy was characterized by a factual and informative approach, with the newspaper focusing on his political achievements. In contrast, The Mirror's reporting was more sensationalist, with the newspaper relying heavily on Kennedy's personal struggles to attract readers' attention. The difference in the use of superlative adjectives is an essential aspect of news reporting as it can shape readers' perceptions and influence their opinions.
