Sophocles' play 'Antigone' centers around the conflict between Antigone and her uncle, Creon, over the burial of Antigone's brother Polynices. However, underlying this conflict, there is also a lack of understanding and communication between Antigone's father, Oedipus, and his sons, Polynices and Eteocles. This lack of understanding eventually leads to tragic consequences for all involved. Similarly, this theme of the lack of understanding between a father and son leading to tragedy is explored in other Greek tragedies, such as Euripides' 'Hippolytus' and Aeschylus' 'Agamemnon'. By examining the characterisation of father figures and their relationships with their sons in these plays, we can gain a deeper understanding of this theme's significance in Ancient Greek society.
In Sophocles' 'Antigone', the conflict between Antigone and Creon centers around the burial of Polynices, who was considered a traitor by Thebes. Antigone believes that it is her duty to bury her brother and goes against Creon's orders to do so. However, the root of the conflict stems from the lack of understanding and communication between Oedipus and his sons, Polynices and Eteocles. Oedipus was exiled from Thebes after discovering that he had killed his father and married his mother. Oedipus' sons, Polynices and Eteocles, then agreed to share the throne of Thebes, with each taking turns to rule for a year. However, after Eteocles' turn ended, he refused to give up the throne, leading Polynices to seek help from outside sources and eventually leading to his death. Oedipus is unaware of this backstory, and when he asks Antigone why she wants to bury Polynices, she responds, "Does not this speak to you of my honor above all else? To honor my brother, my own flesh and blood, even though he gave this city up, an enemy to this land (Antigone, 86-88)." Oedipus cannot understand Antigone's actions, as he is unaware of the familial ties between her and Polynices.
Similarly, in Euripides' 'Hippolytus', there is a lack of understanding between the title character and his father, Theseus. Hippolytus is devoted to the virgin goddess Artemis and despises women, including his stepmother Phaedra. When Phaedra falls in love with Hippolytus, he refuses her advances, leading her to falsely accuse him of rape. Theseus, who is unaware of Hippolytus' devotion to Artemis, is outraged and exiles his son, leading to his eventual death. In this case, Theseus is unable to understand his son's devotion to Artemis and assumes the worst of him based on Phaedra's accusations.
Aeschylus' 'Agamemnon' explores a similar theme of a lack of understanding between a father and son. Agamemnon sacrifices his daughter, Iphigenia, to appease the goddess Artemis and allow the Greek fleet to sail to Troy. However, when he returns home from the war, he is killed by his wife, Clytemnestra, and her lover, Aegisthus. Agamemnon's son, Orestes, is then tasked with avenging his father's death, leading to a cycle of violence and tragedy. The lack of understanding in this case comes from Agamemnon's inability to see the consequences of his actions, as well as his son's struggle to reconcile his desire for revenge with his love for his mother.
One common thread in these plays is the characterisation of father figures. In each case, the father is depicted as a powerful figure who is unable to connect emotionally with their son. They prioritize their own interests over their relationships with their children, leading to a lack of understanding between them. In 'Antigone', Oedipus is more concerned with his own fate and exile than the wellbeing of his sons. In 'Hippolytus', Theseus is more concerned with his own reputation and upholding societal norms than understanding his son's desires. In 'Agamemnon', Agamemnon is more concerned with satisfying the gods and achieving military success than understanding the impact of his actions on his family.
In conclusion, the theme of the lack of understanding between a father and son leading to tragedy is a common one in Ancient Greek tragedies. Sophocles' 'Antigone', Euripides' 'Hippolytus', and Aeschylus' 'Agamemnon' all explore this theme through the characterisation of powerful father figures who are unable to connect emotionally with their sons, leading to tragic consequences. These plays serve as a reflection of the societal norms and values of Ancient Greek society, where a father's power and status were prioritized over familial relationships. Today, this theme continues to resonate as a cautionary tale of the dangers of prioritizing one's own interests over understanding and empathizing with others, especially when it comes to family relationships.
