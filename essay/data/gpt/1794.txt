Introduction
In the business world, expansion is essential for growth. One of the ways in which a company can achieve this is by expanding its brand to foreign markets. In this essay, I will evaluate the major considerations for Monarka Hotel Group when expanding their brand into Nepal. This analysis will be done using the PESTE analysis, which examines the political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, and environmental factors in both the United Kingdom and Nepal.
Political Factors
Political factors play a crucial role in the expansion of any business. Nepal is a democratic republic with a federal system of government. The country has recently undergone major political changes, including the adoption of a new constitution in 2015. The Nepali government has generally been supportive of foreign investment and has implemented policies to encourage investment. One example is the establishment of the Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act of 2019, which provides incentives and subsidies to foreign investors.
On the other hand, the UK is a parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarchy. The country has a stable political environment consisting of multiple political parties. The British government has been supportive of foreign investment, evidenced by its membership in the European Union and its openness to foreign investors. However, the Brexit vote in 2016 has created some uncertainty regarding the country's relationship with the EU.
Economic Factors
Economic factors are another critical consideration when expanding a business. Nepal has a relatively small economy, with a nominal GDP of approximately $29 billion in 2020. However, the country has experienced steady economic growth in recent years, with an average annual growth rate of 6.6% between 2016 and 2020. The tourism industry is one of the key sectors contributing to Nepal's economy, accounting for over 7% of the country's GDP.
The UK has a significantly larger economy, with a nominal GDP of approximately $2.8 trillion in 2020. The country has a diversified economy consisting of several sectors, including financial services, agriculture, and manufacturing. The UK is also a popular tourist destination, with over 40 million visitors in 2019, generating over Â£28 billion for the economy.
Socio-Cultural Factors
Socio-cultural factors can affect business expansion, particularly in the hospitality industry. Nepal is a country with diverse cultures and religions. The predominant religion is Hinduism, followed by Buddhism. Nepali society is also hierarchical, with significant importance placed on respect for elders and social norms. The Nepali people are known for their hospitality and friendly nature, which can be positive for a hotel brand expansion.
In contrast, the UK is a multi-cultural society with no official religion. The British society is known for its liberalism, pragmatism, and civic-mindedness. Hospitality is an essential aspect of British culture, and the country has a thriving hotel industry, with several global hotel chains operating within the country.
Technological Factors
Technological advancements have made it easier for businesses to expand their operations globally. Nepal is a developing country, with limited technological infrastructure. The country's internet penetration rate is relatively low, with only approximately 23.3% of the population having access to the internet. However, this presents an opportunity for companies seeking to implement technology in the hospitality industry, such as online booking, to establish themselves as pioneers in the market.
The UK, on the other hand, is a technologically advanced country, with a high internet penetration rate of over 95%. The country has a robust infrastructure, including a reliable public transportation system, making it easier for tourists to travel to different parts of the country.
Environmental Factors
Environmental factors are crucial considerations for any business, particularly in the hospitality industry. Nepal is a country with diverse landscapes, including the Himalayas and lush forests. However, the country is also susceptible to natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, and landslides, which can disrupt business operations. Climate change is also a concern for Nepal, as melting glaciers in the Himalayas can cause floods and landslides.
The UK has a mild climate, with no significant natural disasters. However, the country is also prioritizing environmental concerns, with initiatives such as the Clean Growth Strategy, which seeks to reduce carbon emissions and increase energy efficiency.
Potential challenges for Monarka Hotel Group
Based on the PESTE analysis, there are several potential challenges that Monarka Hotel Group may face when expanding their brand into Nepal. These challenges include:
1. Limited technological infrastructure: Nepal's limited technological infrastructure could prove challenging for Monarka Hotels Group, as online booking and other technological advancements are crucial in the hospitality industry.
2. Political instability: Although Nepal has a relatively stable political environment, there have been instances of political instability in the past. This instability could affect Monarka's business operations if it leads to disruptions in the economy.
3. Socio-cultural differences: Nepal has a unique culture, and Monarka Hotel Group would need to adapt their services to meet the expectations of Nepali customers. This adaptation could require significant investment in hiring and training local staff.
4. Natural disasters: Natural disasters are a significant concern in Nepal, and Monarka Hotel Group would need to have contingency plans in place to mitigate the effects of such disasters.
Conclusion
In conclusion, expanding a business into foreign markets requires careful consideration of political, economic, socio-cultural, technological, and environmental factors. The PESTE analysis provides insights into these factors, allowing businesses to determine the potential challenges they may face when expanding into a new market. Monarka Hotel Group will need to adapt to the unique environment of Nepal while also remaining true to its brand values if it plans to be successful in expanding its brand to Nepal.
