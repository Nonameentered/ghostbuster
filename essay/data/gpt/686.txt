Determinism and free will have been two philosophical concepts with a long-standing debate in the history of philosophy. The concept of determinism proposes that everything that occurs in the universe is a consequence of a chain of events that have preceded it, implying that the current events are predetermined by the past circumstances. Conversely, the concept of free will proposes that individuals possess the power to choose their own actions, regardless of past events, to an extent that they are not wholly determined by past circumstances. This essay will explore the possibility of free will in a deterministic universe and analyze the arguments of two philosophers who argue for the compatibility of freedom and determinism.
The concept of determinism suggests that every event in the universe is caused by a preceding event that occurred earlier, and the chain of events continues backwards to the beginning of time. This implies that if one could predict the state of the universe at a given time, one could theoretically predict every event that will occur in the future. In contrast, the concept of free will proposes that individuals are capable of making decisions and choices that are independent of past circumstances. According to proponents of free will, individuals can choose from among multiple options and decide which course of action to take, even in the face of difficulties or unfavorable circumstances.
One argument that supports the compatibility of freedom and determinism is the concept of compatibilism. Compatibilism suggests that determinism and free will can exist alongside each other without being at odds. Compatibilists believe that although the universe might be deterministic, human beings still possess the ability to make choices and decisions of their own free will. They argue that free will is not necessarily incompatible with determinism. According to this view, determinism means that every action is caused by a preceding event, but it does not dictate that one has no choice in the matter. Compatibilists suggest that individuals might have the ability to choose between different options, even though each choice is predetermined by the past.
The philosopher David Hume provides one explanation for the compatibility of determinism and free will. Hume's philosophical work divides human actions into two types: actions that are motivated by necessity and actions that are motivated by choice. According to Hume, actions that are motivated by necessity are predetermined and determined by prior circumstances and laws of nature. Conversely, actions that are motivated by choice are actions that individuals undertake out of their own free will. Hume argues that even though determinism dictates that actions are motivated by necessity, individuals can still be free by allowing for a distinction between what is necessary and what is random. This means that individuals have some control over their decisions and can choose among various options in a given circumstance.
Another philosopher who offers arguments for the compatibility of freedom and determinism is Daniel Dennett. Dennett argues that free will is not the ability to make choices that are not caused by anything but is, instead, the ability to make choices that one believes are genuinely their own. Dennett explains this notion by introducing the concept of "self-causation," which suggests that individuals can cause their actions in a way that is consistent with their beliefs and values. Dennett argues that although the universe is entirely deterministic, individuals have the ability to choose and make decisions that are consistent with their historical and biological backgrounds.
Dennett's concept of "self-causation" presupposes that individuals are capable of causing their actions, even though these actions are a result of their background and past experiences. Dennett suggests that individuals' beliefs and values play a significant role in the process of decision-making, which allows them to make choices that they believe correspond to their values and preferences. Dennett believes that the choices that individuals make are genuinely their own, even though they are caused by historical and biological factors.
To conclude, the question of whether free will is possible in a deterministic universe is one that has led to considerable debate among philosophers. The concept of determinism proposes that every event in the universe is determined by preceding events, while the concept of free will suggests that individuals possess the capacity to choose among various options and act on their own choices, regardless of past circumstances. However, Compatibilists argue that determinism and free will can coexist together. David Hume and Daniel Dennett provide different but overlapping arguments for how free will can exist in a deterministic universe. Hume proposes that although the actions of individuals are determined by necessity, they can still be free by focusing on actions that are their own choice. Dennett, on the other hand, suggests that individual beliefs and values play a significant role in decision-making, thus leading to genuinely free choices. Ultimately, while the question of whether free will is possible in a deterministic universe remains open, the arguments of Hume and Dennet provide a useful framework for understanding the different ways in which philosophers have approached the issue.
