The software that was written to control a buggy and allow it to follow an optically marked track required several specifications such as sensor utilization, drive control instructions, and communication with a processing unit. The design involved creating an algorithm for the vehicle to detect track markers and navigate accordingly. Implementation involved coding the algorithm in a programming language with the ability to send signals to the buggy and interpret sensor data. Testing involved trial runs to ensure the buggy followed the marked course consistently.
Overall, the system performed well with the buggy following the marked track accurately. However, improvements could be made to increase the software's robustness in different lighting and track conditions.
