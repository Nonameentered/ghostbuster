The processes of transcription and translation are fundamental to the expression of genetic information in a cell. Transcription is the process by which a DNA sequence is copied into an RNA sequence, while translation is the process by which that RNA sequence is used to synthesize a protein. In this essay, we will discuss the process of transcription, including the key players involved, and how primary transcripts are converted into mature RNA molecules. We will also examine the technique of molecular cloning, including the use of plasmids as vectors, and their role in isolating DNA fragments.
Transcription occurs in three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. The enzyme responsible for transcription is RNA polymerase, which reads the DNA template strand in the 3' to 5' direction and synthesizes a complementary RNA transcript in the 5' to 3' direction. The process begins when RNA polymerase binds to a specific sequence of DNA known as the promoter region. This region typically resides upstream of the gene that the RNA transcript will encode. The promoter is recognized by a complex of proteins, known as transcription factors, that recruit RNA polymerase to the correct site and help it bind to the DNA.
Once the RNA polymerase has bound to the promoter region, it begins transcribing the DNA sequence into RNA. The DNA molecule unzips, exposing a single-stranded template strand, and the RNA polymerase begins building the RNA molecule one nucleotide at a time, using the complementary base pairing rules (A with U, C with G). The act of elongation is accomplished by RNA polymerase sliding along the DNA template and adding additional nucleotides to the developing RNA molecule.
As the RNA transcript emerges from the DNA template, it undergoes several modifications to become a mature RNA molecule capable of being used by the cell. For example, prokaryotic primary transcripts often contain extra RNA sequences, known as leader and trailer sequences, which must be removed to form the mature RNA molecule that is used to make the protein. In eukaryotic cells, primary transcripts undergo a more complex series of processing steps, including the addition of a 5' cap and a poly(A) tail. The 5' cap is a modified guanine nucleotide that helps protect the RNA molecule from degradation, while the poly(A) tail is a long chain of adenine nucleotides that stabilizes the RNA molecule.
The technique of molecular cloning allows scientists to isolate and work with specific DNA fragments that they are interested in studying. It involves the use of plasmids as vectors, which are small, circular pieces of DNA that can replicate independently of the host chromosome. Plasmids can be engineered to contain specific genetic sequences, such as a gene of interest or a reporter gene that is used to indicate the success of the cloning process.
The first step in molecular cloning involves obtaining the DNA fragment that is to be cloned. This can be achieved by using enzymes known as restriction endonucleases, which cut DNA at specific locations determined by their recognition sequences. Once the fragment has been obtained, it is ligated into the plasmid vector using another enzyme called a ligase. The resulting recombinant plasmid contains the DNA fragment of interest, which can be amplified by introducing it into a bacterial host cell.
The bacterial host cell is typically chosen for its ability to grow quickly and easy to work with. The plasmid containing the cloned DNA fragment is inserted into the bacterial cell, where it replicates along with the host chromosome. The cells are then grown under controlled conditions that allow for the selective growth of only those cells that contain the cloned DNA fragment. This selection is typically achieved by using antibiotic resistance genes that are encoded on the plasmid. Cells that do not contain the plasmid will not survive when grown in the presence of the antibiotic, while those that do will grow and divide, generating a population of cells that all contain the cloned DNA fragment.
In conclusion, transcription is the process by which genetic information is copied from DNA into RNA. This process involves RNA polymerase and transcription factors, which work together to recognize the promoter region and copy the DNA sequence into an RNA molecule. Once the primary transcript has been made, it undergoes several processing steps to become a mature RNA molecule capable of being used by the cell. The technique of molecular cloning allows specific DNA fragments to be isolated and studied in detail. Plasmids are used as vectors to help clone the DNA fragment of interest, which can be amplified and studied.
