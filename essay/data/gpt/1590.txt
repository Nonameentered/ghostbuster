Introduction
Merseytravel is a public body that is responsible for transport planning and delivery, encompassing buses, trains, and ferries in the Liverpool City Region. The Liverpool City Region (LCR) is an area that spans over six boroughs and covers nearly 1.4 million people, making Merseytravel an essential player in the regional and local economy. One of the primary roles of Merseytravel is to facilitate tourism in Liverpool by providing a comprehensive public transport system. The city of Liverpool has undergone massive urban regeneration in the recent past, making it a hub of cultural, historical, and sporting activities. The objective of this essay is to explore how Merseytravel can contribute to tourism in Liverpool and participate effectively in urban regeneration, while at the same time, unravel the opportunities and threats that it should consider when strategizing. Particularly, the essay aligns with this goal through exploring how Merseytravel can capitalize on Liverpool's European Capital of Culture status in 2008.
Merseytravelâ€™s Role in Enhancing Tourism in Liverpool
Liverpool is a popular tourist destination, and the city has significantly invested in various initiatives to attract visitors. As a prominent transport provider in the region, Merseytravel plays a critical role in facilitating the tourism sector. Liverpool has several tourist attractions, including the Beatles Story, Cavern Club, and the Albert Dock, which can be accessed through the use of Merseytravel transport services. By providing affordable and efficient transport, Merseytravel enables visitors to tour most of the city's attractions with ease, offering pre-loaded smartcards, day passes, and Family tickets to cater to different needs such as traveling from one destination to another.
One of Merseytravel's significant contributions to tourism is the provision of transport to and from Liverpool John Lennon Airport (LJLA). The airport is used by over 5 million passengers yearly, making it a critical gateway to Liverpool's tourism industry. Merseytravel offers tariffs for train and bus travel to and from the airport, which is a popular alternative to using taxis or private transport. Such options make it easy for visitors to access affordable transport to and from the airport, making their trip to Liverpool convenient and cost-effective.
Urban Regeneration and Merseytravel Participation
Urban regeneration refers to the re-development of deteriorating or obsolete urban areas with the aim of creating a vibrant and sustainable environment. Urban regeneration is essential for Liverpool as it contributes to enhancing the local economy, attracting investment, and improving the general standard of living. The transformation of the city's infrastructure has been significant, with new spaces developed to facilitate cultural and commercial activities. The Liverpool One shopping center, the Arena, and the Convention Center are examples of such spaces that have facilitated job creation, commercial activities, and tourism.
Merseytravel has participated in the urban regeneration activities by providing transport links to the new developments. For example, Merseytravel has created provisions for the buses that service the Liverpool One shopping center, making it accessible to residents and visitors to the city. Additionally, the organization has enhanced the frequency of buses servicing the waterfront area, making it easily accessible to all. By providing transportation links to urban spaces, Merseytravel contributes to the development of easier travel connections across the city, enabling individuals to move around the tourist attractions in Liverpool with convenience.
Participation in urban regeneration activities provides opportunities for Merseytravel, particularly from a financial perspective. For instance, urban regeneration activities attract developments such as hotels, restaurants, and retail spaces resulting in higher passenger numbers for Merseytravel. With higher passenger numbers, the organization could enhance its financial sustainability. The Liverpool Football Club stadium development is one example of how a substantial urban regeneration activity creates potential opportunities for Merseytravel. The new stadium is expected to attract thousands of visitors, resulting in increased passenger numbers and new routes for the organization.
Opportunities and Threats when Strategizing
The European Capital of Culture status awarded to Liverpool in 2008 provided a massive opportunity for Merseytravel. The status recognized Liverpool's transformation into a cultural destination, resulting in increased numbers of visitors. In 2008 Liverpool was at the center of European cultural activities with several events, festivals and exhibitions occurring throughout the year attracting visitors from all over the world. Such activities provided new revenue streams for Merseytravel, with increased passengers resulting in increased revenue.
However, Merseytravel recognizes that the European Capital of Culture status was only for a year. The challenge, therefore, is sustaining the momentum created and effectively capitalizing on such opportunities. One significant threat that Merseytravel could face when strategizing is the emergence of new transport technologies and other competing services. New entrants could mushroom and offer customized services that could lure Merseytravel's customers away. Therefore, the company must always consider how it can maintain the competitive edge and remain as the go-to transport provider in Liverpool.
Conclusion
Merseytravel is an essential contributor to tourism in Liverpool by providing efficient and affordable transport services. By participating in urban regeneration activities, the organization contributes to the creation of new tourist attractions, commercial spaces, and residential areas that require transport services. Participation in such activities creates new opportunities for Merseytravel to enhance its financial sustainability by increasing its passenger numbers. However, Merseytravel must also be keen on possible emerging threats, including competition from new entrants and changes in customer needs and preferences. By sensitively strategizing, Merseytravel can expand its market share in the transport business and contribute to the sustainable growth of Liverpool's economy.
