The globalisation of capital has been a defining feature of the modern world economy, and its implications have been the subject of intense debate among scholars, policymakers, and activists. At the heart of this debate is the question of whether the dynamics of capitalism as understood by Karl Marx still hold true in a globalised context. In this essay, I will evaluate Marx's conception of the capitalist social order and its applicability to the observable phenomenon of the globalisation of capital, particularly the internationalisation of production. I will analyse the foundation of Marx's argument based on the necessity of class conflict and the interdependent relationship between the capitalist and the worker, and examine examples of the contradictions that result from this antagonistic relationship, such as the fall in the rate of profit. Finally, I will consider the application of Marx's conception to the globalisation of capital, including the tendency to separate the producer from the consumer and its impact on industries in developed countries.
To begin with, Marx's conception of the capitalist social order is built upon the idea that at the heart of capitalism is the exploitation of the worker by the capitalist. Marx argued that capitalism is characterised by a fundamental antagonism between those who own the means of production (the capitalists) and those who sell their labour power to the capitalists (the workers). In Marx's view, this antagonism is rooted in the fact that capitalists seek to extract as much surplus value as possible from the workers, while the workers seek to maximise their wages and improve their working conditions. This conflict between the capitalist and the worker is essential to the workings of capitalism, and it is what Marx referred to as the 'class struggle'.
One of the key mechanisms through which this class struggle is expressed is the market. According to Marx, the market is not a neutral mechanism for exchanging goods and services, but rather a vehicle for the exploitation of the worker by the capitalist. The market is structured in such a way as to ensure that the capitalist can make a profit by paying the worker less than the value of the goods and services they produce. In this way, the worker is systematically exploited, and the capitalist is able to accumulate wealth at the expense of the worker.
Marx argued that this exploitation of the worker by the capitalist creates a series of contradictions that ultimately lead to the breakdown of the capitalist system. One such contradiction is the fall in the rate of profit. Marx believed that as capitalists seek to maximise their profits by investing in labour-saving technologies, the organic composition of capital (the ratio of machines to workers) increases. This leads to a rise in the organic composition of capital, which in turn leads to a fall in the rate of profit. As the rate of profit falls, capitalists are forced to cut back on investment, which leads to lower levels of economic activity and ultimately to crisis.
Another contradiction that Marx identified is the tendency of capitalists to undermine their own consumer base. Marx argued that under capitalism, workers are paid only enough to enable them to survive and reproduce. This means that in the long run, workers are not able to consume all the goods and services that are produced, which leads to overproduction and a crisis of overaccumulation. In order to increase their profits, capitalists seek to find new markets for their goods and services, which leads to the phenomenon of imperialism and the domination of weaker nations by stronger ones.
Marx's conception of the capitalist social order is therefore built upon the idea that capitalism is characterised by class conflict and a series of inherent contradictions that will ultimately lead to its collapse. In order to evaluate the applicability of Marx's conception to the globalisation of capital, it is necessary to examine how these dynamics manifest themselves in the context of international trade and the internationalisation of production.
One key impact of the globalisation of capital has been the tendency to separate the producer from the consumer. This has been facilitated by advancements in transportation and communication technologies, which have made it possible for firms to manufacture goods in one part of the world and sell them in another. This has allowed firms to take advantage of lower labour costs in developing countries, where workers are paid a fraction of what workers in developed countries are paid. This process has been referred to as the 'internationalisation of production', and it has been accompanied by the rise of global value chains, in which firms outsource various stages of the production process to different countries.
Marx's analysis of capitalism suggests that this tendency to separate the producer from the consumer is inherently contradictory. On the one hand, it allows firms to maximise their profits by taking advantage of lower labour costs. On the other hand, it undermines the consumer base in developed countries, as workers in these countries are no longer able to consume the goods and services that are produced in other parts of the world. This is because the wages that they earn are not sufficient to enable them to purchase the goods and services that they produce.
This dynamic has been particularly evident in the manufacturing sector in developed countries. As firms have moved their production to developing countries, the manufacturing sector in these countries has declined, leading to job losses and a decline in the standard of living for workers. This has created political tensions in developed countries, as workers have become increasingly disillusioned with the globalisation of capital and the political elites who support it.
Furthermore, the globalisation of capital has exacerbated some of the contradictions that Marx identified in the workings of capitalism. For example, the tendency to exploit workers in developing countries leads to a reduction in the cost of labour, which in turn leads to a rise in the organic composition of capital and a fall in the rate of profit. Moreover, the tendency to seek out new markets in developing countries has led to the domination of weaker nations by stronger ones, which has generated political tensions and has undermined the legitimacy of the global economic order. 
In conclusion, the globalisation of capital has been a defining feature of the modern world economy, and it has raised important questions about the applicability of Marx's conception of the capitalist social order to this new context. Marx's analysis suggests that capitalism is characterised by class conflict and a series of inherent contradictions that will ultimately lead to its collapse. The globalisation of capital has underscored some of these contradictions, such as the tendency to undermine the consumer base in developed countries and the fall in the rate of profit. At the same time, however, the globalisation of capital has created new forms of exploitation and domination, which have made it difficult to predict the ultimate fate of capitalism. Ultimately, whether Marx's analysis of the capitalist social order remains relevant in a globalised context is a question that requires ongoing scrutiny and debate.
