Multi-level governance is a system of governance in which power is shared among multiple levels of government. This system operates through collaborations and cooperation between different levels of government to solve issues that impact the interests of the public. In essence, it is the overlapping of responsibility and power-sharing between different tiers of government, including local, regional, and national levels. Multi-level governance impacts local governments in several ways, as it contributes to the delivery of public services, the formation of policies, and the implementation of laws and regulations.
One way in which multi-level governance affects local governments is through the provision of public services. Public services are delivered through agencies and networks that involve different levels of government, including national, regional, and local authorities. These agencies work collaboratively to deliver public services effectively and efficiently. Multi-agency networks and partnerships are also critical in the delivery of public services, particularly those that require a collective effort to address. Examples of such issues include emergency services, housing, public transportation, and environmental protection. The involvement of different levels of government makes it easier to mobilize resources, expertise, and support to address these critical issues.
Multi-level governance also impacts local governments in terms of policymaking. Policy formulation is typically done at the national level, with local governments playing a critical role in the implementation of policies. This means that local authorities have a significant influence on policy implementation since they are the ones that directly implement these policies. The involvement of local authorities ensures that policies are tailored to meet the needs of local communities. In addition, the participation of local authorities in policy formulation ensures that the interests of their constituents are taken into account. This, in turn, helps in enhancing the trust between local governments and their constituents.
Furthermore, multi-level governance affects local governments in terms of their role in governance. The role of local authorities in governance is to represent the interests of their constituents, administer local services, and manage local resources. Local authorities are also tasked with regulating the use of land, which includes zoning regulations and building standards. The role of local authorities in governance has been strengthened by the European Union, which has granted local authorities a significant degree of autonomy in governance. The European Union has also provided funding to implement various initiatives, addressing issues relevant to local communities.
The English Local Government Act 2000 and the introduction of directly-elected mayors are significant developments that impact local governments. This act introduced the concept of a directly-elected mayor, giving local residents a say in who leads their local government. The Act also gave greater responsibilities to local authorities, which includes the power to set council tax rates, fund new development projects, and support local businesses. The introduction of directly-elected mayors has also increased accountability and transparency in local governance. Mayors are directly accountable to their constituents, and therefore, the implementation of policies is done in a more transparent and responsive manner.
Planning is a unique area of governance that operates at all levels of government. Planning involves the use of land and resources to meet the needs of the community, both in terms of current and future needs. Planning decisions are made by local authorities, regional authorities, and national authorities, depending on the scale of the development projects. Planning policies and guidance, therefore, play an important role in regulating the use of land, managing housing needs, improving public transportation, and preserving the environment.
The current form of national planning policy guidance in England is the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The NPPF is a comprehensive guidance document that sets out the principles of planning policy. The NPPF provides local authorities with a framework for the development and implementation of planning policies, including policies for housing, the environment, and transportation. The NPPF also provides guidance on sustainable development, which is an important consideration in the planning process.
In conclusion, multi-level governance is a complex system that involves the sharing of power and responsibilities among multiple levels of government. The impact of multi-level governance on local authorities is significant, particularly in the delivery of public services, policymaking, and governance. The introduction of the English Local Government Act 2000 and the NPPF have also provided local authorities with a framework for the development and implementation of planning policies. Overall, multi-level governance has had a positive impact on local authorities, allowing them to better serve the needs of their constituents, manage resources more efficiently and democratically, and contribute to the achievement of national goals.
