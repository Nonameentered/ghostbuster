The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries marked a significant period in world history. During this time, Europeans were exploring and colonizing new territories around the globe. As they encountered extra-European peoples, they developed various perceptions and classifications of these cultures. The Europeans' views of extra-Europeans were influenced by various factors, including their religious beliefs, political ambitions, and economic interests. This essay will discuss how Europeans perceived and classified extra-European peoples during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, as well as the factors that contributed to their assimilation into Western consciousness.
One of the primary ways Europeans perceived and classified extra-European peoples during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was through the use of terms such as "pagans" and "noble savages." The concept of "pagans" referred to individuals who were not Christians or Jews. Europeans considered non-Christian cultures to be inferior, and they believed that it was their duty to convert these cultures to Christianity. The concept of "noble savage" referred to the idealized image of extra-European peoples as uncorrupted by Western civilization. Europeans viewed these cultures as pure and simple, with a connection to nature that Western society had lost. This romanticized view of extra-European cultures influenced European attitudes towards these cultures and helped justify colonialism and imperialism.
Genealogy was also important in establishing a common identity with which to understand and relate to these cultures. Europeans believed that their culture was superior, and they saw themselves as the standard against which other cultures should be measured. As a result, Europeans attempted to place non-European cultures into a hierarchy based on similarities or differences with European culture. Europeans used genealogy to argue that these cultures were "cousins" to European cultures, with shared ancestry and roots. They claimed that these cultures were less developed than Europeans, but still related, which helped to rationalize the Europeans' subjugation of these cultures.
The categorization of extra-European peoples was also influenced by the political and economic ambitions of European nations. As European nations expanded their empires, they had to justify their actions to their own populations and to the rest of the world. Europeans portrayed extra-European peoples as wild, savage, and uncivilized to justify the expropriation of their lands, resources, and labor. This allowed European countries to present themselves as superior and to promote the idea that they were "civilizing" the rest of the world. This colonialist narrative was perpetuated throughout the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and helped establish the frameworks through which Westerners perceived and categorized extra-European peoples.
In conclusion, the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were a pivotal time in world history, marked by European exploration and colonization. During this time, Europeans developed various perceptions and classifications of extra-European cultures. They used terms like "pagans" and "noble savage" to describe non-European cultures and established genealogical connections to legitimize their subjugation. Additionally, the economic and political ambitions of European nations played a significant role in how these cultures were classified, as they sought to justify their imperial actions to the rest of the world. While our perceptions of non-European cultures have evolved, it is important to understand the historical context that shaped these frameworks and continue to work towards a more equitable and just global society.
