Occupational therapy (OT) is a field of healthcare that aims to help individuals improve their ability to perform daily living tasks or occupations. Over the course of my studies, my understanding of OT has evolved drastically. I have come to appreciate the vast scope of OT, ranging from rehabilitating patients who have suffered from strokes to assisting individuals with learning disabilities to navigate the complexities of daily living tasks.
My personal experience with illness played a significant part in highlighting the importance of OT. As a teenager, I had a severe accident that left me incapacitated for months. I was unable to perform daily living tasks, such as brushing my teeth or eating, by myself. Several months of therapy gradually helped me regain my mobility and independence. I came to understand that OT is a crucial means of helping people recover and maintain their independence. I also realized that OT goes beyond just administering therapy; therapists need to be empathetic, patient, and understanding.
Through my studies, I have learned how OT enables individuals to achieve meaningful goals. The therapy can help stroke patients recover their ability to bathe themselves or help children with autism develop their social skills. OT, therefore, is about helping individuals engage in activities that hold personal meaning and purpose to them. That is why OT is a holistic approach to healthcare, encompassing psychological, physical, and emotional factors in interventions.
My studies have also made me aware of the discrepancies in the emphasis placed on OT in hospital and learning disability settings. Although OT is essential in both settings, I have noticed that OT in learning disability principles is not emphasized enough despite the huge potential of this therapy. There is a grave misconception that OT applies only to physically disabled individuals. However, OT can make a massive difference in the lives of people with learning disabilities, and it is essential to emphasize this through therapies.
Individuals with learning disabilities face several challenges in daily living tasks, from dressing to interacting with others. Occupational therapists help them develop social skills, such as appropriate eye contact, appropriate personal space, and body language. They also train individuals in coordination, mobility, and memory. Individuals with learning disabilities face several challenges while navigating employment opportunities, but these challenges can be overcome with the help of OT. With tailored training, individuals can acquire occupational skills that set them on the path to employment.
In conclusion, my understanding of OT has continued to evolve over the course of my studies, and I have come to appreciate the vast scope of the therapy. My personal experience with illness confirmed my belief in the importance of the therapy in rehabilitating individuals, engaging in meaningful everyday activities. However, the discrepancy in the emphasis placed on OT in hospital and learning disability settings is concerning. OT in learning disability settings is just as crucial as in hospital settings, if not more. Emphasizing OT in learning disability settings can help individuals with learning disabilities better navigate daily living tasks, acquire employable skills, and enjoy the benefits of meaningful employment.
