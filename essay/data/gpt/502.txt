Introduction:
The B2B market is one of the most lucrative markets in the world. But, it requires a lot more from businesses seeking success in this market. Unlike B2C products, the buying behavior in the B2B market is far more complex, and it requires deeper understanding. In this essay, we will discuss the aspects of business buying behavior that companies selling B2B products or services must understand in order to demonstrate a marketing orientation. We will also look at the characteristics of B2B demand and how companies like Fujitsu have adjusted their strategies to engage with B2B clients and meet their specifications.
Understanding Business Buying Behavior:
Business buying behavior refers to the process by which businesses acquire products or services from other businesses. When selling to businesses, vendors must fully understand the business buying behavior. The reason is that there are fewer B2B customers available as compared to B2C, so it is important to provide the customers with a personalized and customized experience. The following are the three aspects of business buying behavior that the companies selling B2B products or services must understand:
1. Decision Making Unit:
The decision-making unit (DMU) is the group of individuals responsible for making decisions regarding the purchase of a product or service. The DMU is unique to the B2B market, and it is composed of various individuals that have varying levels of interest and involvement in the purchasing process. The DMU may include different departments such as the finance team, the purchasing team, the production team, and the marketing team. The members may have different objectives for the purchase, and thus a different set of criteria for evaluating potential suppliers.
2. Buying Process:
Unlike B2C transactions, B2B transactions involve a longer and more complex buying process. The buying process consists of several stages. In the first stage, the buyer identifies the need for a product or service. In the second stage, the buyer looks for potential suppliers, and in the third stage, the buyer evaluates potential suppliers based on criteria such as quality, price, and delivery time. In the fourth and final stage, the buyer makes the purchase decision and establishes a long-term relationship with the supplier.
3. Purchasing Criteria:
Purchasing criteria refers to the factors that businesses use to evaluate suppliers when making purchasing decisions. These criteria may include factors such as the quality of the product, the price, the delivery time, the reputation of the supplier, and the level of customer service provided by the supplier. The purchasing criteria may vary from business to business, and it is crucial that the suppliers understand the buying criteria of their potential customers.
Characteristics of B2B Demand:
The B2B demand is characterized by the following features:
1. Derived Demand:
The demand for a product or service in the B2B market is derived from the demand for the final product or service being produced by the customer. This means that the B2B customer will only buy a product or service if it is essential in their production process.
2. Inelastic Demand:
The demand for products and services in the B2B market is generally inelastic. This means that changes in price do not significantly affect the demand for the product or service.
3. Fluctuating Demand:
The demand for products and services in the B2B market is fluctuating. It is affected by cyclical changes in the economy and seasonal factors.
4. Multi-Step Buying Process:
The buying process in the B2B market is usually a multi-step process involving several individuals. This means that vendors need to build relationships with key decision-makers and influencers.
