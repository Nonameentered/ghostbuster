Drama is an effective tool to help learners acquire English communication skills and improve their self-confidence, social cooperation, and learner autonomy. In this essay, I will describe how educational drama can facilitate language learning based on my experience as a teaching assistant in a five-day English summer camp organized by a university in Taiwan. Furthermore, I will discuss the benefits of drama in language learning and provide examples.
The summer camp aimed to improve students' English communication skills through drama activities. The students were divided into groups and assigned different roles in a play. They were responsible for creating a plot and dialogues for the play. The students also prepared their costumes and stage design. Students had the opportunity to work collaboratively, interact with native speakers, and use English in a meaningful context. The drama activities provided a platform for students to practice their language skills naturally and creatively.
During the camp, I observed that students' self-confidence had increased. They were eager to participate in the various games and activities. Before the camp started, some students had difficulty speaking in English, but after the camp, their oral skills had improved significantly. This occurred because students had the opportunity to practice speaking in various contexts, and their confidence increased gradually as they tried new things. Moreover, they received constructive feedback from their peers and teachers, which helped them improve their English speaking skills.
The drama activities also promoted social cooperation among students. Students had to work together to create the play and ensure that every member had a significant role. They developed teamwork skills by helping each other with their lines, costumes, and props. During rehearsals, they learned the importance of collaboration, communication, and empathy. These skills are vital in real-life situations and are foundational elements in becoming an effective communicator.
In addition to boosting self-confidence and promoting social cooperation, drama activities enhance learner autonomy. The students learned how to think critically, creatively, and independently. They created a story, wrote dialogues, designed a stage, and chose costumes according to their preferences and ideas. They were encouraged to express themselves and their identities using English. This autonomy provided them with a sense of ownership and agency in their learning. They became more motivated and invested in the learning process.
The benefits of drama activities in language learning are multifaceted. They enable learners to use English in a meaningful context, develop interpersonal skills such as empathy and teamwork, and foster learner autonomy. As drama activities incorporate various language skills such as listening, speaking, reading, and writing, they enable learners to acquire a comprehensive language understanding.
Moreover, drama activities create immersive and experiential learning environments that connect students' emotional and cognitive domains more effectively. In other words, drama activities facilitate affective learning, which considers emotions and attitudes as well as the cognitive elements of learning.
Nevertheless, some educators are skeptical about the use of drama activities in language teaching. They doubt the relevance and validity of such activities in a language curriculum. Others believe that such activities are time-consuming, difficult, and require a high level of preparation and expertise from teachers.
However, drama activities can be modified and tailored to address different needs and goals of different learners. They can be incorporated as a supplement or an integral part of a language curriculum. Furthermore, drama activities can be adapted to suit the level, age, and interests of learners. For instance, young learners can participate in simpler storytelling activities, whereas more advanced learners can act in plays with complex plotlines and characters.
In conclusion, educational drama methodology is an effective tool to facilitate English communication, boost students' self-confidence, promote social cooperation, and enhance learner autonomy. The five-day English summer camp organized by a university in Taiwan is an example of how drama activities can improve language skills and create a positive and meaningful learning experience for students. Drama activities enable learners to connect their emotional and cognitive domains and develop interpersonal skills that are crucial in real-life situations. Therefore, educators should consider incorporating drama activities in language curricula or extracurricular activities and explore their potential in promoting language learning.
