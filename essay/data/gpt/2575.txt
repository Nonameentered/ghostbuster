Greek tragedy is a genre of drama that was invented in Ancient Greece during the fifth century BCE. These plays were performed in the city of Athens during religious festivals, and served as a form of entertainment as well as a way for the Athenians to make sense of the world around them. In Greek tragedy, women played important roles, both as characters and as thematic elements. Through their representation, Greek tragedy conveys the expectations and limitations placed on women in fifth century Athens, where women were seen as inferior to men, confined to domestic spheres and were expected to serve men and take care of their households. This essay will explore how Greek tragedy represents the expectations and limitations placed on women in fifth century Athens through three plays: Medea, Antigone, and Oedipus Rex.
Medea is a Greek tragedy by Euripides, first performed in Athens in 431 BCE. The play is about a woman named Medea who is betrayed by her husband, Jason, and seeks revenge by killing their children. Medea is an embodiment of the expectations placed on women in fifth century Athens, where women were confined to domestic spaces and expected to serve men. In the play, Medea is a wife and a mother, but she is also a foreigner in Athens. Her foreignness is emphasized in the play, as she is described as a barbarian from Colchis, a region that is located in modern-day Georgia. Due to her foreignness, she is an outsider in Athenian society, and her belongingness is constantly questioned. This highlights the limitations placed on women in Athenian society, as even women who were married to Athenian men were seen as foreigners.
Medea’s character also highlights the expectations placed on women to serve men. At the beginning of the play, she is a devoted wife to Jason, doing everything in her power to help him succeed. She uses her knowledge of magic to help him obtain the Golden Fleece, which is his ticket to becoming a hero. However, as the play progresses and Jason marries another woman to gain political power, Medea’s devotion turns to rage and revenge. She sees herself as a victim of male oppression, and her desire for revenge is an expression of the anger and frustration that she feels at being trapped in a patriarchal society.
Antigone is another Greek tragedy, written by Sophocles in 441 BCE. The play is about a woman named Antigone who defies the king’s orders to bury her brother, who was considered a traitor. Antigone is a rebellious character who challenges the expectations placed on women in fifth century Athens. In Athenian society, women were expected to obey the laws and the orders of their male superiors. This expectation is reflected in the play, as Creon, the king, orders that Antigone’s brother must remain unburied as a punishment for his treason. However, Antigone defies this order and buries her brother, leading to a conflict between her and Creon.
Antigone’s character represents a challenge to the limitations placed on women in Athenian society. She is a strong and independent woman who refuses to be silenced by male authority. Her defiance of Creon’s order can be seen as a form of resistance against the patriarchal norms that were enforced in Athenian society. Through Antigone, Sophocles shows that women are capable of defying authority and standing up for themselves, even in a society that seeks to silence and suppress them.
Oedipus Rex is a Greek tragedy that was written by Sophocles in 429 BCE. The play is about a man named Oedipus who unknowingly marries his mother and kills his father. Although the play is about a man, it also contains important themes and representations of women. One of the most important female characters in the play is Jocasta, Oedipus’s mother/wife. Jocasta is a complex character who embodies the expectations and limitations placed on women in Athenian society.
Jocasta’s character represents the limitations placed on women in Athenian society. She is confined to a domestic space and is expected to serve her husband, Oedipus. However, she is also a strong and independent woman who is able to challenge her husband’s authority. When Oedipus begins to uncover the truth about his identity, Jocasta begs him to stop his investigation. She knows that the truth will reveal that Oedipus has married his mother and killed his father, and she does not want this to be revealed. However, despite her plea, Oedipus continues to investigate, leading to the tragic ending of the play.
In conclusion, Greek tragedy represents the expectations and limitations placed on women in fifth century Athens in a variety of ways. Through characters like Medea, Antigone, and Jocasta, Greek tragedy reflects the way in which women were seen as inferior to men, confined to domestic spheres, and expected to serve men. At the same time, these characters also challenge these limitations by showing that women are capable of defying authority and standing up for themselves. In this way, Greek tragedy serves as a powerful reflection of the way in which women were represented and treated in fifth century Athens.
