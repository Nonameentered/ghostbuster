Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s theory of the social contract centers on the idea that the transition from the state of nature to the civil state significantly affects man. He believed that man in the state of nature is free, equal, and independent. However, the civil state restricts man's natural freedom and reduces him to a subordinate role, unable to act without the consent of the state. Rousseau believed that the state of nature was the ideal state for man and the civil state corrupted him. In this essay, I will explore Rousseau’s ideas on the transition from the state of nature to the civil state and the impact this transition has on man.
In his book, Discourse on Inequality, Rousseau describes the state of nature as a state where man has no government, laws, and property. He is free and equal with all other men, and his only aim is self-preservation. According to Rousseau, man's state of perfect freedom allows him to act in his own interests without any external pressure. However, he recognized that the state of nature is brutal, chaotic, and precarious. For man to escape this state of nature, he has to enter into a social contract where he gives up his natural freedom to a common sovereign that will protect his life, property, and liberty. This social contract is the basis of the civil state.
Rousseau believed that the transition from the state of nature to the civil state was a necessary evil. Man had to surrender some of his natural freedom to avoid the risks associated with the state of nature. However, this transition had a significant impact on man's character and personality. According to Rousseau, man in the civil state is no longer free, independent, or equal. He is subject to the laws of the sovereign, and his freedom is curtailed. The civil state imposes artificial political and societal structures on man, which are contrary to his natural tendencies.
In the civil state, Rousseau believed that man's character changes. Man becomes more competitive, self-interested, and hierarchical. The state of nature allowed man to be cooperative and compassionate towards each other. However, in the civil state, man is forced to compete with each other for resources, power, and social status. This competition leads to the emergence of social hierarchies, where some individuals have more power and wealth than others.
Furthermore, Rousseau argued that the civil state alienates man from his true self. The state imposes social norms and values that are contrary to man's natural inclinations. Man is forced to adhere to the moral and cultural norms of the civil state, which are often artificial and oppressive. The civil state, therefore, creates an artificial self that is disconnected from man's natural self.
In conclusion, Rousseau believed that the transition from the state of nature to the civil state significantly affects man's character and personality. Man in the civil state is no longer free, equal, or independent. He is subject to the laws of the sovereign, which curtail his natural freedom. Additionally, the civil state changes man's character by making him more competitive, self-interested, and hierarchical. Man is forced to adhere to the moral and cultural norms of the civil state, which are often artificial and oppressive. Therefore, Rousseau believed that the state of nature was the ideal state for man, and the civil state corrupted him.
