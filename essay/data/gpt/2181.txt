Introduction
Agricultural export subsidies refer to government interventions in the market aimed at promoting export products from the agricultural sector by enhancing their competitiveness and reducing their prices. This is achieved through offering numerous incentives that reduce costs and improve the profits from exports, including subsidies on production, transport, marketing, and exportation. The demand for agricultural exports is still high, with most developed countries exporting most of their agricultural products to developing countries. Nevertheless, the implementation of agricultural subsidies has generated numerous conflicts between developed and developing countries. This essay provides an analysis of agricultural export subsidies, their impact on developing countries' economies, and potential solutions for addressing the conflicts. 
Agricultural Export Subsidies and Their Effects
Agricultural export subsidies are measures that are employed by developed countries as a strategy to encourage their domestic farmers to increase exports of their products. Some of the significant exports from developed countries include, but are not limited to, agricultural products, food items, and plants. Subsidies are incentives offered by governments to support certain industries and products. Agricultural export subsidies are usually authorized for certain products to make them competitive with subsidised products from other countries. 
One of the economic consequences of agricultural export subsidies is that prices of products from developed countries are artificially lowered. Importing countries can access cheaper products from developed countries, subsequently harming the competition for exporters from developing countries. Developed countries are thus able to destroy smaller developing countries' economies by offering cheaper products for import. For this reason, they can effectively generate more revenue for their own economies, which are established and intended for the mass production of goods. Therefore, the implementation of agricultural export subsidies undermines the comparative advantage of developing countries. Throughout the globalization process, many countries in the developing world have attempted to diversify their economies by growing their industries and agriculture sector. However, with the emergence of export subsides offered by developed countries, some of these developing countries can barely compete with them on the global market.
Another effect of agricultural export subsidies is that they can lead to a decreased rate of productivity overall. The price manipulation through subsidies results in a skewed market that cannot operate effectively. Essentially, subsidies result in farmers in developed countries becoming over-reliant on the government's incentives to generate their income, as opposed to the fair market value of their products. With less competition and subsequent decreased productivity, the market fails to provide the necessary signals to support efficient production. Therefore, productivity is stifled as farmers focus on exporting for the government subsidies, rather than producing quality products or improving efficiency.
Agricultural export subsidies in developed countries create a "cash-cow income" for their farmers. This results in a skewed economy that is mostly driven by the government. Without these subsidies, many farmers in developed countries might not generate enough income from their agricultural activities. As a result, interested parties have to manufacture market conditions that will enable them to continue servicing farmers or risk losing their support. This creates an over-dependence on government incentives, and any reduction or removal of those incentives may lead to a collapse of the agricultural sector.
In addition, subsidies often result in a surplus of agricultural products, with consequent negative effects on their price. This can also lead to creating a product glut that lowers overall value, thus hurting the economic and financial goals of farmers and their respective businesses. Many homes and communities in developing countries depend on farming as a primary livelihood. Consequently, drastic price drops may lead to job losses or a fall in income. 
The Impact of Agricultural Export Subsidies on Developing Countries
Developing countries are primarily exporters of agricultural products, but the implementation of export subsidies in developed countries creates an imbalance, which has a tangible effect on their economies. The subsidies granted by developed countries cause significant challenges for developing countries. Firstly, it undermines the comparative advantage of developing countries in the agriculture sector, preventing them from exporting household, agricultural products effectively, and damaging their economies severely.
Secondly, agricultural export subsidies have a significant impact on the development agenda of developing countries. Through such interventions, the opportunities to develop the agricultural sector of developing countries may be thwarted, which, in turn, reduces the potential for economic growth in those countries. Even in countries that already have established agriculture development policies, farmers on the global market may also suffer if global policies contradict with countries' domestic policies.
Moreover, the agricultural sector in developing countries often relies on local requirements and population growth, thereby reducing potential opportunities for producing crops. The development of agricultural markets in developing countries is also affected by the implementation of export subsidies. Export-subsidized goods from developed countries flood developing markets, and this makes it difficult for local farmers to compete. 
Additionally, the rising level of poverty is one of the impacts of agricultural export subsidies affecting developing countries. These countries have been victims of a consistent imbalance of trade between developed and developing countries, which means that exporting agricultural products suffer the most compared to other sectors. As a result, local farmers stop producing and divert their attention to other sectors that may help them increase their income. This, in turn, results in increased food insecurity for communities that depend on agriculture for their livelihoods.
Solutions for the Conflicts Arising Between Developed and Developing Countries in the International System
One of the solutions to the conflicts arising between developed and developing countries in the international system is the replacement of subsidies with other economic development strategies. Prosperity could be generated by opening up new markets, creating stable conditions for investment, and developing diverse economies. Policies that encourage entrepreneurship, education, and innovation can also help increase resources in various sectors of developing countries. Such policies also provide diverse financial models that don't rely on export subsidies.
Another solution is to sustain spending on the agricultural industry. A country's limited budget often becomes the reason behind spending cuts. Therefore, funding has been introduced to support the agricultural sector of developing countries. Funding can be used to help farmers develop their skills, innovate and improve their agricultural practices. This can, in turn, help increase productivity, creating opportunities to interact with the global market and improve incomes. 
Moreover, global agreements and treaties could be signed banning any form of export subsidies from developed countries. Developed countries have generated immense financial gains by implementing agricultural export subsidies. Banning export subsidies may help balance the need for promoting equal economic development for both developing and developed nations. This would also help remove distortion and increase the competitiveness of developing countries.
Developing countries can also establish domestic agriculture policies that protect their economies from external influences. Such policies may include protection of vulnerable sections of the population from international price increases, market protection for locally produced goods, and designing policies that encourage investment in the agriculture sector. This will allow the agriculture sector to develop in its own unique way, ensuring that farmers can sell their products without being hurt by externalities. 
Conclusion
In conclusion, the implementation of agricultural export subsidies by developed countries creates significant economic consequences for developing countries. This essay analyzed the economic effects and consequences of agricultural export subsidies on developing countries and offered potential solutions for addressing the conflicts arising between developed and developing countries in the international system. It is now clear that subsidies decrease prices, productivity, and also results in a surplus of products, all of which hurt developing countries. It is, therefore, essential to acknowledge the implications of export subsidies for both developed and developing countries and re-evaluate the necessity of these subsidies. This will help to promote fairness within the international market and enable developing countries to progress towards sustainable economic development.
