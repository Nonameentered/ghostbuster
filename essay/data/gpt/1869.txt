Introduction:
Tourism industry has become a major contributor to global economy in recent years. The industry has experienced significant growth due to the increasing number of people with disposable income and desire to explore new destinations. The tourism industry can be divided into different segments depending on various factors such as type of travel, age and gender of tourists, and purpose of travel. In this essay, the focus will be on two specific tourism models of consumer behaviour- the senior and young couple tourist segments. The aim of this essay is to apply the tourism models to the destination organization sector in the city of Oxford in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the essay will provide some suggestions to marketing managers on how to improve understanding of tourist behaviour within these segments.
Background:
Oxford is a historic city which is located in the south-eastern part of England. The city is famous for its prestigious universities and colleges, museums, galleries, and cultural events. Oxford attracts both domestic and international tourists with diverse interests and preferences. However, the focus of this essay is on senior and young couple tourists. It is important to understand the behaviour of these tourists in order to develop effective marketing strategies that will attract and retain them.
Senior Tourists:
Senior tourists are those who are aged 60 or above and are retired from their professional lives. This group of tourists has different needs, desires and travel behaviour as compared to other segments. According to Cohen's model of tourist typologies, seniors are classified as 'organised mass tourists'. This indicates that they prefer to travel in large groups, usually as part of a package tour organised by a travel agent. Senior tourists prefer safety, comfort, and convenience over adventure and novelty. They usually have a fixed schedule and prefer to visit historic places, cultural events, and natural attractions. Senior tourists have a higher level of disposable income and are more likely to spend money on luxury services such as spa treatments, fine dining, and shopping.
Young Couple Tourists:
Young couple tourists are those who are below the age of 40 and do not have children. This group of tourists has different travel preferences as compared to seniors. According to Cohen's model of tourist typologies, young couple tourists are classified as 'drifters'. This indicates that they prefer to travel independently and are looking for adventure, novelty, and excitement. Young couple tourists usually have a flexible schedule and prefer to visit destinations that offer unique experiences such as outdoor activities, music festivals, and food tours. They have a lower level of disposable income as compared to seniors and are more likely to spend money on budget-friendly accommodation, transportation, and food.
