The legal positivist tradition is one of the most influential schools in the realm of jurisprudence. At its core, legal positivism refers to the concept that law is a subject of study in its own right, distinct from morality and other social phenomena. Legal positivists hold that this body of knowledge should be developed independently of the normative concerns that animate the study of political philosophy or ethics. Central to this approach is the view that legal systems are a matter of creation by human beings, and that they are enforced through the exercise of power. The legal positivist tradition has been highly controversial, with critiques arguing that it condones immoral behavior, and that it overlooks important connections between law and social norms. This essay provides an overview of the legal positivist tradition and its tenets, before analyzing Austin's Command Theory and the weaknesses associated with this approach. Following this, we will discuss Hart's response to Austin and assess the way in which Hart remedies the problems associated with the positivist approach.
The Legal Positivist Tradition
The legal positivist tradition arose in the 19th century, primarily in response to the challenges posed by natural law theorists who claimed that there was a necessary connection between law and morality. Legal positivists such as John Austin argued that legal systems were the result of commands issued by sovereigns, and that these commands were the basis of legal obligation. The legal systems themselves impart no moral content, and the only thing that distinguishes a valid legal system from an invalid legal system is the ability of the sovereign to enforce their commands. Austin claimed that all laws come into being through three constituent elements: a sovereign, a command, and a sanction.
Austin's Command Theory
Austin's command theory is a central tenet of legal positivism. According to Austin, laws are commands that are issued by the sovereign and backed by sanctions. For Austin, the sovereign is the entity that has the power to impose sanctions in the case of disobedience. This notion of sovereignty is an essential element of Austin's theory, and he argues that the sovereign's power is absolute, and that their commands are unconditional. The sovereign's commands are aimed at their subjects, who are expected to follow them to avoid sanctions. Sanctions play a crucial role for Austin, as they provide the basis for legal obligation. However, Austin acknowledges that there are a variety of different types of sanctions that might be applied by the sovereign, from fines and imprisonment to more extreme forms of punishment. Austin's conception of law is essentially a view of the state as a coercive institution, whose laws are primarily aimed at restraint and control.
Weaknesses of Austin's Command Theory
Many critics of legal positivism have pointed out that Austin's command theory suffers from a variety of significant weaknesses. For example, it is often criticized for its inability to account for the fact that many legal systems contain laws that are inconsistent or incompatible with one another. Austin seems to suggest that a valid legal system consists of a sovereign who commands, and subjects who obey. However, this is an oversimplification of the complexity of legal systems, which often contain internal divisions, competing authorities, or other conflicting norms.
In addition, Austin's command theory has been criticized for its inability to account for the limits of state power. For example, many legal systems contain protections for individual rights such as free speech or privacy, which the state cannot simply dismiss or override. For Austin, the sovereign's power was absolute, and their commands were unconditional. This view seems to conflict with the idea that legal systems have limits, or that there might be circumstances where disobedience is justified. Finally, Austin's command theory has been criticized for its inability to distinguish between valid and invalid laws. According to Austin, as long as a law is backed by a sanction, it is legally valid. Yet, this seems to overlook the possibility that laws can be unjust or oppressive, or that there might be better or worse legal systems in existence.
Hart's Reaction to Austin
Hart was a legal philosopher who sought to remedy the weaknesses associated with Austin's Command Theory. Hart's view is that legal positivism can be improved by adopting a more nuanced and sophisticated approach to legal systems. For Hart, legal systems are composed of two primary categories of rules: Primary and secondary rules. According to Hart, primary rules are similar to the commands identified by Austin. These rules are aimed at the conduct of individuals, and are imposed by the state. Secondary rules are different from primary rules in that they govern the creation, modification, and repeal of primary rules. This is an important distinction, as it recognizes that legal systems are not a monolithic entity, but rather a complex network of rules, norms, and values that are continually being revised and updated.
The role of secondary rules in Hart's theory is crucial. Hart held that a legal system cannot be composed of primary rules alone, but must also contain a set of secondary rules that enable the system to function and develop over time. These secondary rules include rules of recognition, which identify the basic criteria for the validity of primary rules, and rules of change, which identify the procedures for modifying or abolishing them. The existence of secondary rules helps to explain why legal systems can be stable and predictable, despite their complexity and diversity.
Hart's view stands in contrast to Austin's, as it emphasizes the importance of understanding legal systems as complex and evolving entities, rather than simple collections of commands and sanctions. Hart's theory also recognizes the importance of the social context in which legal systems arise, and the need to account for the way in which different legal systems interact with one another.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the legal positivist tradition is a highly influential school of thought that has attracted a great deal of debate and discussion. Austin's Command Theory is central to this tradition, and his views have been both praised and criticized over the years. While his theory has been noted for its simplicity and clarity, it has also been criticized for its inability to account for the complexity of legal systems, the limits of state power, and the moral content of laws. Hart's response to Austin offers a more nuanced and sophisticated approach to legal systems, based on the recognition of the role of secondary rules. Hart's view underscores the importance of understanding the social, historical and political context in which legal systems arise, and provides a useful framework for understanding the complexities of legal systems. Ultimately, the legal positivist tradition will continue to play a central role in debates about the nature of law and the role of the state, and future legal philosophers will no doubt continue to refine and develop the central tenets of this approach.
