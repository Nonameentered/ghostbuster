Material selection is a crucial aspect in the manufacturing process of any industrial application. In this essay, we will discuss two industrial applications: heat exchangers and computer manufacturing, emphasizing how material selection plays a significant role in both of these fields.
Heat exchangers are devices used to transfer heat from one fluid to another by using a conductive material. These machines are primarily used in the chemical processing and power generation industries. Selecting materials for heat exchangers needs to consider their ability to resist corrosion, heat, and fatigue cracks. From a mechanical perspective, materials used in heat exchangers should have the required mechanical strength, coping with high-temperature service exposure, and resistance to continuous fatigue. Stainless steel is one of the widely chosen materials due to their exceptional properties, including high strength, formability, and corrosion resistance. They also retain their shape and size, having a low rate of thermal expansion. Along with that, it has the required thermal conductivity, ensuring effective heat transfer.
In contrast, when looking at computer manufacturing, following material properties must be considered, such as durability, electrical conductivity, and resistance to heat and impact. Plastic is a popular choice in computer manufacturing due to its thermal insulation properties and high impact resistance. The manufacturing process of plastic used in computers is based on injection molding, ensuring speed and efficiency in producing complex shapes. Additionally, aluminum is also a commonly used material because of its ability to disperse heat, reducing the risk of the equipment getting damaged and extending its lifespan.
Finally, we should also consider the manufacturing process, which has a massive impact on the final product. Heat exchangers can be made through welding, brazing, or casting, whereas computer manufacturing involves a combination of injection molding and milling. The manufacturing process selected will impact the overall performance of the product, affecting its durability, corrosion resistance, and thermal stability.
In conclusion, it can be seen that material selection plays a critical role in both heat exchangers and computer manufacturing, with the appropriate selection contributing significantly to the quality and performance of the final product. It is essential to choose materials that offer the properties necessary to enable the product to function well over a long service life. By combining suitable materials with an appropriate manufacturing process, the functionality, durability, and reliability of the final product can be maximized.
