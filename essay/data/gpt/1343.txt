Introduction
The normalisation thesis is a sociological concept that describes the process by which deviant behaviour becomes accepted and normalised within a society. It suggests that the use of recreational drugs in youth culture has become more socially acceptable and therefore normalised. The purpose of this essay is to explore the normalisation thesis and its impact on youth culture's attitudes towards recreational drug use. In doing so, this essay will draw on examples from Parker et al.'s (1998) study and other theorists to support the explanation.
Furthermore, this essay will describe a qualitative, semi-structured interview with a young adult to explore actual and perceived drug use and address ethical considerations and reflexivity in research. The interview will provide firsthand information on how the normalisation of drug use affects youth culture.
The Normalisation Thesis
The normalisation thesis has been widely discussed in the sociology of health and illness literature and is based on the assumption that deviant behaviours, such as drug use, are normalised through a gradual process of mainstreaming. It suggests that behaviours which were once deviant gradually become more accepted and normalised over time. The normalization thesis asserts that drug use among the youth has been normalised and has become a part of everyday life.
Parker et al. (1998) conducted a study on the normalisation of drug use in the UK. The study revealed that drug use was a normal part of growing up for many young people in the UK. The study showed that the age of first drug use had decreased, and the range of drugs used had widened. Young people were also found to be more aware and knowledgeable about drug use, and the social consequences of drug taking were seen as less severe.
Parker et al.'s (1998) study provided evidence for the normalisation thesis and demonstrated how drug use had become more accepted and normalised in youth culture. The study also highlighted the importance of peer pressure and pressure from social groups as a significant factor in drug use. The study found that young people were more likely to experiment with drugs if they had friends who used drugs.
The impact of the normalisation thesis on youth culture's attitudes towards recreational drug use can be seen in the increased prevalence of drug use among young people. The study by Parker et al. (1998) found that drug use was a part of everyday life, and young people who did not use drugs were seen as being different. The normalisation of drug use has led to an increase in drug-related harm, including health problems, social problems and an increase in criminal activity.
Other Theorists
Other theorists have also explored the normalisation of drug use in youth culture. In their study, Dalgarno and Shewan (2000) argued that drug use had become normalised through the media, music, and popular culture. They suggested that the media portrayed drug use as a fun and exciting activity and that young people were exposed to a wide range of pro-drug messages through the media. The study found that young people who used drugs were more likely to have been influenced by the media, and the media was a significant factor in drug use.
The work of Beauvais and colleagues (1996) supported the normalisation thesis and provided evidence that drug use was significantly more prevalent in social settings where drug use was normalised. The study found that young people who were exposed to high-risk environments, where drug use was normalised, were more likely to use drugs.
Furthermore, research by Furlong and colleagues (2010) suggested that young people's drug use could be linked to a sense of identity and belonging. The study found that young people who identified with particular subcultures, such as the rave and techno music scenes, were more likely to use drugs. This suggests that drug use has become a part of the culture and identity of some young people.
Qualitative, Semi-Structured Interview
To explore how the normalisation of drug use affects youth culture further, a qualitative, semi-structured interview was conducted with a young adult. The interviewee was a 22-year-old student who had used drugs recreationally in the past. The aim of the interview was to explore the interviewee's experiences of drug use and to investigate how drug use was normalised in youth culture.
The interview began by asking the interviewee about their experiences of drug use. The interviewee described their drug use as experimental and stated that they had used drugs to enhance their experiences at social events, such as parties and festivals. The interviewee commented that drug use was an essential part of the culture of the social events they attended and that not using drugs made them feel like an outsider.
When asked about their understanding of drug use in youth culture, the interviewee explained that drug use had become normalised and that it was no longer seen as a deviant behaviour. The interviewee spoke about how drug use had become an integral part of their social circle and how their friends viewed it as an acceptable behaviour.
The interviewee also commented on the influence of the media and popular culture on drug use. The interviewee stated that they had been exposed to a range of pro-drug messages through the media, music and movies. They believed that the media had normalised drug use and that it had become a part of the culture.
Ethical Considerations and Reflexivity in Research
When conducting research on sensitive topics such as drug use, it is important to consider ethical considerations and reflexivity. Ethical considerations involve ensuring that participants are treated with respect, their confidentiality is protected, and the research does not harm participants.
In this qualitative, semi-structured interview, ethical considerations were taken into account by ensuring that the participant's confidentiality was protected. The interview was conducted in a private space, and the interviewee was given the option to remain anonymous.
Reflexivity involves acknowledging the researcher's positionality, biases and subjectivity. In conducting this interview, the researcher acknowledged their own biases towards drug use and attempted to remain impartial when asking questions. The researcher also acknowledged their positionality as a middle-aged individual and attempted to view the participant's experiences through their own lenses.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the normalisation thesis suggests that the use of recreational drugs in youth culture has become more socially acceptable and therefore normalised. Parker et al.'s (1998) study provided evidence for this concept and showed how drug use had become more accepted and normalised in youth culture. Other theorists have also conducted studies that support the normalisation thesis, highlighting the impact of the media, music and popular culture on drug use.
A qualitative, semi-structured interview explored the interviewee's experiences of drug use and supported the concept of the normalisation of drug use. The interviewee's experiences demonstrated how drug use had become an accepted behaviour within youth culture.
It is essential to consider ethical and reflexivity considerations when conducting research on sensitive topics such as drug use in youth culture. By acknowledging the importance of these considerations, researchers can ensure that their research does not harm participants and is impartial and unbiased.
