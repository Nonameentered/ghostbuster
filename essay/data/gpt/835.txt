The Occupational Behaviour Frame of Reference (OBF) is a popular framework in occupational therapy practice used to address the challenges faced by individuals with moderate learning disabilities. It is an approach that emphasizes the importance of occupation and engagement in meaningful and purposeful activities, with the goal of improving overall well-being. This framework focuses on assisting individuals in identifying barriers that prevent them from engaging in activities, and developing intervention plans that promote their involvement in daily activities.
May is a 45-year-old woman with a moderate learning disability referred to an occupational therapist for intervention. May’s husband reported that she has difficulty with performing daily living tasks such as self-care, cooking, cleaning, and managing finances. Additionally, she has a lack of social skills and suffers from anxiety, which impedes her ability to develop and maintain social relationships.
Using the OBF model, the first step in developing an intervention plan is to assess May’s current occupational behavior. The occupational therapist can observe May engaging in daily activities and interview her to gain insights into her preferences, strengths, and challenges. May’s occupational behaviors that prevent her from accomplishing daily tasks include poor time management, difficulties with focusing on a task, and low motivation. May’s occupational therapist, along with her husband, will use this information to formulate an intervention plan that incorporates strategies to address May’s specific needs.
Short-term goals can be established for May, such as learning to manage her finances and planning meals for the week. The occupational therapist can develop a simplified budget that May can understand to help her manage her finances. She can also teach May a meal-planning routine that incorporates purposeful activities such as grocery shopping, budgeting, and cooking.
Long-term goals for May could be to enhance her social skills, develop her self-efficacy, and improve her confidence. Occupational therapists can introduce social-skills groups at her day center to help May learn new communication skills and understand unspoken social cues. May can also engage in leisure activities with the support of day center staff to enhance her self-efficacy.
The effectiveness of the intervention plan can be evaluated by interviewing May, her husband, and day center staff. The interview questions should explore changes in May’s performance, problems, and personal goals. May’s husband can be asked about changes in May’s daily life and the extent of her interaction with her environment. Day center staff can be asked about May’s success in group activities.
In conclusion, occupational therapy intervention based on the OBF model can address the occupational challenges faced by May with moderate learning disability and improve her overall life quality. By applying this framework, occupational therapists are introducing an individualized, client-centred approach that aims to improve the individual's overall well-being, enhance skill development, and promote engagement in activities that adds purpose and meaning to their lives.
