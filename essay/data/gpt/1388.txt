Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed the emergence of numerous capitalist structures that have come to dominate the global economy. These structures have been significant in enabling the processes of globalization, which describes the increasing interconnectedness and interdependence between nations. The transnational capitalist system has been identified as one of the principal drivers of globalization, given its ability to cross national borders and create economic structures that operate at the global level. However, while it has been responsible for promoting international trade and economic growth, the transnational capitalist system has equally been faulted for contributing to neo-colonial moves where powerful nations and corporations exploit weaker ones under the guise of free-market globalization. This essay examines the role of the transnational capitalist system in regulating and appropriating the processes of globalization and how it leads to a neo-colonial move.
The transnational capitalist system is a network of multinational corporations, global financial institutions, and transnational bodies that interact to influence and regulate the global economic landscape. It is made up of numerous players that range from powerful corporations such as Google, IBM, and Coca-Cola, to financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization (WTO). These entities operate at the global level, leveraging their influence to direct and control economic activities in different countries worldwide. Their interactions signify the emergence of a global economic order that transcends national borders and is driven by the process of globalization.
One of the primary roles of the transnational capitalist system is regulating the process of globalization. The system primarily achieves this through its ability to shape trade policies and investment decisions. Because the system is made up of powerful corporations and financial institutions, it can influence the economic policies of different countries to enhance its interests. Through its extensive investment activities, it determines which nations receive foreign investment and the types of capital flows that enter and leave different markets. Its role in shaping trade policies cannot be overemphasized, as it conducts negotiations on behalf of powerful nations to ensure that they gain access to new markets and resources. The WTO and other international trade bodies have been instrumental in achieving this goal, opening up new trade routes and lifting barriers to international trade.
The transnational capitalist system also appropriates the processes of globalization. Its immense power and influence have enabled it to harness the power of globalization to further its interests. It has used globalization to create new markets for goods and services, expand production capacity, and enhance business efficiency. The globalization of supply chains, for instance, has enabled multinational companies to operate at low costs, where they can source raw materials, manufacture products, and distribute them across different parts of the globe. This global supply chain currently includes many developing countries whose economies have become integrated into the global economy through the activities of multinational corporations.
However, while the transnational capitalist system has been a driving force behind globalization, it has increasingly contributed to neo-colonial moves. In particular, it has created the conditions for the exploitation of weaker countries by strong international players. The transnational capitalist system has enabled multinational corporations to exploit weaker countries through measures such as transferring polluting activities to developing countries with lower environmental standards and outsourcing low-wage labor to these countries. Such activities have created situations where developing countries become dependent on multinational corporations to maintain their economies, with little consideration for their long-term interests.
Furthermore, the transnational capitalist system has shifted power from the state to multinational corporations and global financial institutions. This shift in power has often resulted in a disregard for the needs of national development in favor of corporate interests. By influencing the policies of national governments, multinational corporations have created regulatory environments that favor corporate interests and promote the accumulation of wealth by the global elite to the detriment of local people.
Neo-colonial moves resulting from the transnational capitalist system have created a situation where the global wealth and resource distribution is skewed in favor of the rich nations, who control and dominate the global economy. The transfer of wealth from weaker to stronger nations has perpetuated poverty and inequality in developing countries, with the vast majority of the population lacking basic amenities such as water and electricity. With multinational corporations having more power than states, foreign corporations have increased their ownership of local businesses in developing countries, even as they continue to pay low wages, while extracting resources from the country. The countries collude with these corporations, leading to situations where local people have little access to the benefits of their own resources.
In conclusion, the transnational capitalist system has been instrumental in the processes of globalization, given its immense power, influence, and reach. It has regulated and appropriated globalization trends, opening access to new markets, resources, and investment opportunities for powerful multinational corporations. However, the system has equally been blamed for contributing to neo-colonial moves that exploit weaker countries and perpetuate poverty and inequality in different parts of the world. The appropriation of globalization has resulted in a skewed distribution of wealth and resources, with the global elite dominating the global economy at the expense of local people. The resulting agreements have made these outcomes possible, with large multinational corporations commandeering economic and political resources at the expense of even the national governments of the countries where their influence is felt. There is an urgent need to have more strict regulations to ensure equitable sharing of the benefits of globalization. Governments of these weak countries should take an active role in ensuring that multinational corporations operate in their countries in the best interest of​​ their citizens.
