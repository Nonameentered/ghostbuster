Pablo Neruda, a well-known poet of the twentieth century, lived through a time of great social and political unrest. As a Chilean diplomat, he was posted to Madrid during the Spanish Civil War, which lasted from 1936 to 1939. Neruda’s poems not only speak to the beauty of life, but also condemn the atrocities of the war and express his empathy for the people affected by it. His experience as a Consul in Madrid during the war played a significant role in shaping his poetry, as it motivated him to give a voice to the oppressed people of Spain.
The Spanish Civil War began as a battle between the Spanish Nationalist Party, led by General Francisco Franco, and the Spanish Republican Party, the elected government of the country. The Republicans were leftists, liberals, and progressives who supported democracy, freedom, and civil rights, while the Nationalists were monarchists and fascists who aimed to overthrow the republic. The war became an ideological conflict between communism and fascism, prompting other nations to take sides. The conflict intensified, invoking acts of terror, division, and violence, eventually leading to Franco’s victory. Neruda witnessed the conflict as it raged on the streets of Spain. As a diplomat, he saw the atrocities committed against the civilians through firsthand experiences, and this played a significant role in his poetry.
Neruda's diplomatic position made him a first-hand witness of the war and its effects. In his poetry, he shows a keen sense of empathy towards the lives that were devastated by it. In the poem “Spain in Our Hearts,” Neruda talks about how Spain's people suffered due to the war. He writes, "We loved each other in the shadows / when they came down on us with daggers." This line of the poem conveys the sense of fear and uncertainty that the people of Spain experienced. Moreover, it shows how Neruda felt the pain of the people. His experience might have made him feel vulnerable, but he embodied the tragedy of the people of Spain through his poetry. He wrote to immortalize their struggles, and his poems became a voice for the oppressed people of Spain.
Neruda’s experience as a consul during the Spanish Civil War played an integral role in shaping his poetry. A good example of this is in his poem, "I Explain Some Things," where he writes about the "terror" reigning in Spain. The poem illustrates how the war had a profound impact on the people of Spain, their economy, and their social order. The loss and pain caused by the war compelled Neruda to use his poetic voice to describe the situation as it moved on beyond him. The tone of his poetry in this text reads with such urgency and candor as he attempts to give words to the fear and pain stricken on the hearts of people. 
Neruda's time in Spain as a consul also inspired him to become a revolutionary poet, writing poetry that reflected his own political beliefs and the political turmoil he experienced. In the poem “España en el Corazón,” Neruda expresses his solidarity towards the cause of the Spanish Republicans, who fought against Franco’s fascist regime. In his poetry, Neruda uses his words to push back against oppressive regimes and dictators like Hitler and Stalin. Through his work, he also instills revolutionary ideas, targeting the working class and the oppressed people. One good example of this is the poem "The United Fruit Company." In the poem, he criticizes the powerful American corporations for exploiting the poor rural people of Central America. Neruda joins the people’s protests, supporting them and advocating for the overthrow of the oppressors. 
Furthermore, Neruda’s experiences as a consul in Madrid during the Spanish Civil War led him to explain the impact of the war on the people he served. In “Spain in Our Hearts,” Neruda writes, "And when the coffins rattle the earth concludes / nothing can be born from the soil receiving / these bitter seeds of hatred and sorrow." The coffin here serves to represent death, loss, and grief brought on by the war. Neruda shows the horrific impact the war had on the people of Spain, their loss of loved ones, and the resilience that was needed to rise from the ashes. Additionally, in “I Explain Some Things,” the poet explains the desolate landscape of Madrid during that time, “On the dining table, a soup bowl made of clay, / an antique soup ladle. / A head covered up by a handkerchief / lies beside a broken pitcher.” The vivid picture painted here perfectly depicts the postwar scenario of Spain’s disarrangement as well as the sustenance of war.
As a consequence of Neruda’s experience in Madrid during the Spanish Civil War, his poetry illuminated the suffering of the oppressed people of Spain through first-hand observations. His empathy towards the people of Spain is also evident in his work. In his poetry, Neruda celebrates the beauty of life by also painting a picture of the brutal treatment of repression and dictatorship. He emphasizes this by showing the loss of human life brought on by war. Hence, Neruda's experience as a consul in Madrid during the Spanish Civil War influenced his poetry and allowed him to be a voice for the silenced and oppressed people of Spain.
To conclude, Neruda's experience as a consul in Madrid during the Spanish Civil War was a significant turning point for him. He saw tremendous destruction caused by human greed and was motivated to fight back through his poetry. Throughout his writing, he used language to illustrate the profound impact that the war had had on the country and its people. Neruda’s presence during the Spanish Civil War enhanced his empathy and awakened his steadfast sense of humanism, which was reflected in his poetry where his focus was on the suffering and pain brought on by war. Hence, Neruda’s experience as a consul in Madrid during the Spanish Civil War had a profound impact on his poetry, which remains relevant to this day.
