Virgil's Aeneid is one of the most significant works in Western civilization, portraying the story of Aeneas, a Trojan prince, and how he found the city of Rome. The poem is not only a historical story but also serves as an attempt to create an epic for Rome. Virgil wrote The Aeneid to glorify Rome and its origins. In doing so, he presents Aeneas as an ideal Roman hero who embodies all the values and qualities Rome cherishes in a hero. Aeneas is brave, loyal, pious, and decisive, and his actions always align with the community's best interests. This essay aims to evaluate how Virgil presents Aeneas as a Roman hero by examining his heroism, his leadership abilities, and his embodiment of Roman values and virtues. 
One essential aspect of Aeneas's character that defines his heroism is his bravery. Throughout the Aeneid, Aeneas is shown to be a courageous warrior who never backs down from a battle, regardless of his circumstances. For example, he fights fiercely against the Greeks during the Trojan War, even when it seems all hope is lost. Aeneas's courage allows him to maintain the morale of his troops and motivates them to fight alongside him. In Book 2, Aeneas carries his father on his back and leads his family and fellow Trojans out of the burning city, displaying immense physical strength and bravery in the face of danger. As a result, his people continue to revere him as a hero and follow him devotedly, even in the face of adversity. Aeneas's bravery consistently impresses those around him, and Virgil's portrayal of his hero as a fearless warrior inspires admiration and reverence in readers. 
Aeneas's leadership abilities are similarly central to his status as a Roman hero. In many instances in The Aeneid, Aeneas is thrust into leadership roles due to his charisma and strength of character, and he regularly proves his worthiness to lead. For instance, when the Trojans land in Carthage, they face a precarious situation and expect Aeneas to provide guidance and leadership. He delivers, ensuring unification of the Trojans with the people of Carthage through his diplomatic and negotiating skills. In Book 6, Aeneas ventures to the Underworld and is presented with a vision of Rome's future. His vision of the great future of Rome instills within him a sense of purpose, and he becomes determined to make it a reality. When he later encounters the queen of Carthage, Dido, he is unwavering in his commitment to his mission, even when it means hurting her. His leadership most notably shows when he is instrumental in the defeat of Turnus, the arch-nemesis, in a final battle. In the face of great adversity, Aeneas's leadership skills are essential in uniting his army and ensuring their victory, and his unwavering commitment to the cause of Rome motivates his men. 
Aeneas embodies many Roman values and virtues that are central to Virgil's conception of a Roman hero. One of the essential values is Aeneas's piety, which manifests in his devotion to the gods and respect for the traditions and cultures of Rome. In The Aeneid, Aeneas frequently prays to the gods for guidance and protection, and they regularly come to his aid. For example, in Book 1, he prays to Jupiter for mercy and good omens before departing from Carthage, and Jupiter responds with a favorable storm that speeds him on his way. Furthermore, Aeneas always makes sure to honor the gods through sacrifices and religious ceremonies, and in doing so, sets an example of religious piety for his followers. Aeneas's respect for tradition is seen in his reverence for the past. In Book 2, Aeneas is depicted as a survivor of the fall of Troy and is therefore intimately familiar with the value of historical knowledge. His recollection of the history of the Trojan War is an essential reminder of the lessons of the past, helping him avoid the same mistakes. Aeneas's devotion to both piety and tradition demonstrates the value of these virtues to Rome and his exemplary leadership of Rome's people. 
Another virtue Virgil assigns to Aeneas is his sense of duty and self-sacrifice. Throughout the poem, Aeneas is faced with many difficult decisions that challenge his loyalty to Rome. In Book 4, Aeneas must leave behind the lovesick Queen Dido to fulfill his duty by founding Rome. Although he loves her, he recognizes his duty to his people and puts aside his personal feelings. Similarly, in Book 6, Aeneas is faced with a difficult decision when he reaches the Underworld. He is given the opportunity to stay with his father in Elysium and forsake his duty to found Rome. Instead, he puts aside his personal desires and resolutely continues with his mission, determined to fulfill his destiny. Aeneas's willingness to sacrifice his own desires for the greater good is a quality that Virgil believed to be vital to Rome's success and advancement. His commitment to duty and self-sacrifice embodies the virtues that the Romans value in their leaders.
Finally, Aeneas embodies the Roman ideal of virtus, or excellence and valor. He is a skilled warrior who is also deeply empathetic and compassionate, as shown by his dealings with young Pallas in Book 10. He demonstrates his competence, knowledge, and skill in carrying out his duties to Rome through his bravery, leadership, piety, and sense of duty. Simultaneously, Aeneas never displays a sense of undue arrogance, recognizing his own weaknesses and vulnerability. His virtue and authenticity make it easier for people to trust and respect him. Aeneas's character also embodies the Roman ideal of pietas, or the devotion to one's country, family, and duty. Aeneas embodies this ideal, continually putting Rome's well-being above his own desires and ambitions. 
In conclusion, Virgil presents Aeneas as the ideal Roman hero, who embodies the virtues and values that the Romans regarded as essential in their leaders. Aeneas's character is an embodiment of the ideal Roman. He is heroic, imbued with leadership abilities and embodies the Roman values and virtues of piety, reverence for tradition, duty, and self-sacrifice. Aeneas's strengths lie not only in his abilities as a mighty and brave warrior but also in his ability to lead, inspire, and serve, thus making him an exemplar of virtus and pietas. Virgil's presentation of Aeneas is a reflection of Roman ideologies, values, and virtues, and his story serves as a tribute to the greatness of Rome and its people. As a result, The Aeneid continues to resonate with readers today, standing as an eternal testament to the timeless qualities of a true hero and a magnificent civilization.
