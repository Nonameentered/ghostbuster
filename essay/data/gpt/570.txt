The Victorian era witnessed a significant shift in the social and economic landscape of England, which in turn impacted the lives of children who lived on the streets. During this period, art and literature played a pivotal role in shaping the middle-class view of street children and contributing to the social hierarchy and class values prevalent in Victorian society. This essay aims to explore the significance of art and literature in shaping the perception of street children in the Victorian era and its impact on class values.
The Victorian era was marked by an unprecedented rise in urbanization and industrialization, which led to widespread poverty and destitution among the working-class. The living conditions of the poor were deplorable, and the streets were overrun with children who were forced to beg or work to survive. As a result, the issue of street children became a significant concern for the middle-class philanthropists, who viewed them as the embodiment of the social ills of the time. The middle-class, through art and literature, aimed to raise awareness about the plight of these children while also shaping their perception of them.
One of the most significant contributions of art and literature in the Victorian era was in creating a 'cult of childhood.' The idea of 'childhood' was romanticized through children's literature, which portrayed children as innocent and pure beings, untouched by the corrupting influence of society. This idealization of childhood meant that street children, who were often portrayed as unruly, dirty, and prone to criminal activities, were viewed as a threat to the societal order. This notion of childhood was widely accepted by the middle-class, who saw it as their duty to protect and provide for these vulnerable children.
Art and literature also played a vital role in highlighting the condition of street children and raising awareness about their plight. Novels such as Charles Dickens' 'Oliver Twist' and 'David Copperfield' portrayed the harsh realities of life on the streets, with vivid descriptions of the squalor in which these children lived. These novels were highly influential in shaping the perception of street children as victims of circumstance, rather than criminals or vagrants. In addition, the sentimental paintings of the era, such as William Powell Frith's 'The Crossing Sweeper,' depicted the poverty and struggles of the street children, evoking empathy and sympathy from middle-class viewers.
The middle-class perception of street children was also influenced by the religious and moral values prevalent at the time. The Victorians believed in the concept of 'deserving' and 'undeserving' poor, with the deserving poor being those who were perceived as hard-working and virtuous. This belief was reflected in the portrayal of street children in art and literature, where those who displayed a moral character were seen as deserving of help, while those who were seen as morally bankrupt were deemed unworthy of assistance. This distinction between deserving and undeserving poor was a crucial determinant of class values, with the middle-class viewing themselves as the 'deserving' and therefore, more virtuous class.
However, despite the efforts of art and literature in shaping the middle-class perception of street children, the issue of poverty and the plight of street children persisted. The Victorian era was marked by the philanthropic efforts of the middle-class, who sought to alleviate the suffering of the poor through various charities and social welfare programs. However, these efforts were often marred by paternalistic attitudes and a belief in the superiority of the middle-class, which resulted in a perpetuation of the social hierarchy and class values of the time.
Furthermore, the sentimental portrayal of street children in art and literature also contributed to a 'victim narrative,' which perpetuated the notion that street children were helpless and in need of rescue. While this narrative was aimed at evoking empathy and sympathy from the middle-class, it also reinforced the idea that these children were incapable of rising beyond their circumstances, thereby rendering them powerless and dependent on the charity of others.
In conclusion, art and literature played a significant role in shaping the middle-class perception of street children in the Victorian era. The romanticized notion of childhood, the portrayal of street children as victims of circumstance, and the depiction of poverty and squalor were all instrumental in evoking empathy and sympathy from the middle class. However, these efforts were marred by paternalistic attitudes and a belief in the superiority of the middle-class, which perpetuated the social hierarchy and class values of the time. Nevertheless, art and literature played an important role in bringing attention to the plight of street children and providing a voice for the most vulnerable members of Victorian society.
