The concept of social and moral behavior is an integral part of every society as it sets the guidelines for individuals to follow in their everyday life. However, different societies use different methodologies to control the social and moral behavior of their citizens. The Western societies and Bunyoro, an area in western Uganda, both use unique methods to ensure social conformity among their population.
In Western societies, the methods employed to control social and moral behavior are based on laws, regulations, and policies. The justice system is one of the primary methods used by Western societies to regulate individual behavior. Western legal systems are known for their harsh punishments, including life imprisonment and the death penalty, for those who violate the law. The fear of facing severe consequences helps to deter individuals from engaging in immoral and antisocial behavior.
Another method used in Western societies to control social and moral behavior is through the education system. The education system is designed to instill values such as honesty, compassion, and integrity in individuals from a young age. Inculcating these values in children helps them develop a moral compass that guides them as they grow up.
In the United States, the government has also implemented various policies to control social and moral behavior. For instance, laws are in place to regulate drug use, prostitution, and gambling. Furthermore, the United States is known for its strict gun control laws, which are meant to reduce gun-related violence. These laws work together to ensure that citizens comply with the standard moral and social behavior endorsed by the government.
However, in Bunyoro, social and moral behavior is regulated through cultural beliefs and customs. In Bunyoro, the cultural values and traditions have been transmitted from one generation to the other through oral communication. Since a significant percentage of the population in Bunyoro is uneducated, laws and regulations are not effective in controlling their social and moral behavior. Instead, customary laws and beliefs are entrenched in the minds of the people and guide their everyday decision-making.
In Bunyoro, the family unit plays a crucial role in regulating social behavior. Parents are the primary influencers of children's social and moral behavior. Children are taught to respect their elders and to follow the cultural norms of the society. Children are also taught the importance of honesty and the need to work hard to sustain themselves and their families.
Another significant method used in Bunyoro to regulate social behavior is through community service. Bunyoro is a communal society where people work together to support one another. People engage in community service activities such as cleaning up public spaces, constructing houses for the needy, and participating in religious activities. These activities help to instill a sense of responsibility and altruism in individuals, hence promoting social cohesion.
However, Bunyoro society also has elaborate punishment systems that are meant to regulate negative behaviors. For example, when a married individual is caught cheating on their spouse, they must pay a fine in the form of a cow, sheep, or goats as a form of restitution. In severe cases of criminal offenses, such as murder, the community would provide lynch justice where the offender is killed by the community.
In conclusion, Western societies and Bunyoro use different methods to control social and moral behavior. Western societies rely on laws, policies, and regulations primarily to control social behaviors while Bunyoro relies on cultural beliefs and customs. Both societies recognize that social and moral control is necessary for a functional society. Western societies' methods may not be effective in societies where people have low educational levels, as is the case in Bunyoro. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the unique cultural values and beliefs of a society when developing strategies to control social and moral behavior.
