Abortion has always been a controversial issue in English law. The current English legal position on abortion is governed by the Abortion Act of 1967 that was amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act of 1990. The Act allows for an abortion to be performed within 24 weeks of pregnancy if two doctors agree that; the continuation of the pregnancy would result in a serious risk to the physical or mental health of the mother, or that there is a likelihood of the child being born with a serious physical or mental disability. Beyond 24 weeks, an abortion can only be performed if it is necessary to save the life of the mother or to prevent severe permanent impairment or injury to her. However, the Act does not distinguish between circumstances of foetal disability, which is a significant failure of the current legal position. 
Due to the lack of distinction between circumstances of foetal disability, the current legal position is considered inadequate. The Act permits abortions until birth for the child diagnosed with a severe disability. The English law is considered as being discriminative to the disabled, as it suggests that the lives of the disabled are less valuable than those of non-disabled people. It suggests that disabled people are not entitled to equal dignity and respect as non-disabled people, which violates the international human rights principle of non-discrimination. This failure of the legal position has been criticised by medical professionals, human rights organisations and disability rights activists. 
A rights-based approach, drawing from the American legal position, can improve the balancing exercise. The American legal position is based on Roe v. Wade, a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court in 1973. The Court held that the right to privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was broad enough to encompass a woman's decision to have an abortion. The Court held that a state may only regulate abortion insofar as health, generally referring to maternal health and safety, applies. The Court also held that a state may prohibit abortion after viability, which is when the foetus can survive outside of the womb, except when necessary to protect the life or health of the mother. 
The American legal position can inform a rights-based approach to the English legal position on abortion by emphasising the rights of women and the unborn child. A rights-based approach to the legal position on abortion would involve balancing the rights of women with the rights of unborn children. In this approach, the mother’s right to bodily autonomy would be balanced with the right to life and dignity of the foetus. 
To improve the balancing exercise, the rights-based approach must give recognition to the rights of the foetus or unborn child. According to the British Medical Association (BMA), a foetus is “a living being entitled to respect and due consideration.” It is therefore imperative to consider the rights of the foetus in any legal position on abortion. However, rights conflict in the predicament presented by the foetus having a severe disability. The mother's right to bodily autonomy is in conflict with the right to life of the foetus. In this case, it is essential to consider the quality of life of the unborn child, and that they too have a right to dignity and respect. 
An effective rights-based approach would be one that considers the foetal disability but does not discriminate against disabled individuals. The law should consider the individual circumstance of the foetus or the mother in such cases, and decisions should be made based on their specific conditions. The American legal position established under Roe v. Wade, which recognizes the right of women to access safe and legal abortions, can be used to inform the English legal position on the importance of balancing the rights of women and the rights of the foetus. 
The rights-based approach can be improved by using the concept of dignity, which underpins human rights. The concept of dignity emphasises the intrinsic value of human life, regardless of the physical or mental condition of the individual. Dignity is a core value that should be protected by the law. The concept can help to balance the rights of the mother, the foetus, and the disabled to ensure that all parties are treated with equal respect. By acknowledging the concept of dignity, a rights-based approach would ensure that the decision making process is respectful to the status of every person involved. 
A rights-based approach to the legal position on abortion should also be informed by the United Nations human rights treaties, which both the United States and the United Kingdom are party to. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities asserts the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of their disability. It confirms that persons with disabilities have the same rights as non-disabled persons, including the right to life and to health. The Convention has been ratified by both the United States and the United Kingdom. 
The concept of human rights can guide the balancing of competing rights in cases of foetal disability, and a rights-based approach would be beneficial for those seeking to address the failures of the current English legal position. Such an approach, drawing from American legal position, would recognise the right to bodily autonomy of women while taking into account the right to life and dignity of the foetus. The approach would also recognise the rights of disabled persons, which is essential for promoting equality and non-discrimination. 
In conclusion, the current English legal position on abortion is inadequate due to the lack of distinction between circumstances of foetal disability. This failure of the legal position has been criticised for being discriminative to the disabled, suggesting that the lives of the disabled are less valuable than those of non-disabled people. A rights-based approach, drawing from the American legal position, can be used to improve the balancing exercise by giving recognition to the rights of women and the rights of the unborn child. The approach must consider the dignity of each party involved and recognise the rights of disabled persons to promote equality and non-discrimination. In this way, the legal position on abortion can be improved, ensuring that it is respectful to the status of every person involved.
