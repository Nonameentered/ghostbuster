Anthropology emerged as a social science in the nineteenth century, with the aim of studying human societies and cultures across the world. Anthropologists sought to document and understand the diversity of human experiences, and to provide insights into how social organizations functioned. Like any academic discipline, anthropology faced a number of impediments in its early development, which related to a lack of methodologies and theoretical frameworks. It was only through the efforts of influential anthropologists like Malinowski, Durkheim, and Radcliffe-Brown that social anthropology was able to emerge as an important discipline.
One of the key impediments that anthropology faced was the lack of systematic frameworks for conducting research. In the nineteenth century, anthropology was often conflated with other fields like natural history and geography. This meant that there was no clear methodology for conducting research, and anthropologists had to devise their own approaches. For example, early anthropologists like Edward Tylor and Lewis Henry Morgan conducted armchair research, based on their own library-based analyses of cultural phenomena. This lack of empirical data made it difficult to construct detailed analyses of social structures and organizations.
Another impediment faced by anthropology was the rise of evolutionism, which came to dominate the field in the nineteenth century. Evolutionism was a belief system that posited that human societies evolved from simple to complex over time, with the most complex societies being the most advanced. This belief system had profound implications for anthropology, as it meant that anthropologists were often focused on documenting ‘primitive’ and ‘savage’ societies, rather than engaging with modern ones. This approach reduced the complexity of human cultures to a linear progression from simple to complex, thus ignoring the diversity of human experiences.
The ideas of nineteenth century anthropology were shaped by evolutionism, which was used to justify and rationalize European colonialism. Anthropologists often argued that European cultures were the most advanced, and that other societies needed to be ‘civilized’ in order to reach the same level of development. This belief system had a profound impact on anthropology, shaping the outlook and perspectives of anthropologists for decades to come.
However, despite these impediments, there were a number of key figures in the development of anthropology who sought to overcome these barriers. One of the most important of these figures was Bronislaw Malinowski. Malinowski is perhaps best known for his ethnographic work in the Trobriand Islands, which he used to develop the theory of functionalism. Malinowski believed that social structures and institutions could only be understood in relation to the functions that they performed within a society. By studying the structures of Trobriand society and examining the functions that they performed, Malinowski was able to provide a detailed analysis of how the society functioned as a whole.
Another figure who sought to overcome the impediments of anthropology was Emile Durkheim. Durkheim was a sociologist who believed that social phenomena could be studied scientifically. He argued that sociology should be seen as a distinct science, with its own methodologies and theoretical frameworks. Durkheim’s work was highly influential in shaping the field of anthropology, as he provided a theoretical framework for understanding social phenomena that could be applied across cultures and societies.
A third figure who sought to overcome the impediments faced by early anthropology was Alfred Radcliffe-Brown. Radcliffe-Brown was a key figure in the development of structural-functionalism, which was an attempt to provide a more detailed analysis of social structures and organizations. Structural-functionalism posited that social structures were made up of various elements that worked together to ensure the functional stability of the society as a whole. By examining these elements and how they interrelated, Radcliffe-Brown was able to provide a more detailed understanding of the way that societies functioned.
Despite their shared attempts to overcome the challenges posed by early anthropology, there were notable differences in the ideas put forward by Malinowski, Durkheim, and Radcliffe-Brown. Malinowski focused on the functional aspects of social structures, arguing that they could only be understood in relation to the functions that they performed for society. Durkheim, on the other hand, argued that social structures and institutions had a moral basis, and were shaped by shared beliefs and values. Radcliffe-Brown’s structural-functionalism focused more on the interrelationship between different social structures and organizations, rather than their individual functions or moral basis.
The impact of these different theoretical frameworks on the development of anthropology was significant. They paved the way for a more nuanced understanding of social phenomena, and allowed anthropologists to examine the complex interplay between different social structures and organizations. However, they also had their limitations. For example, the functionalism of Malinowski often failed to take into account the historical context in which social structures emerged. The structural-functionalism of Radcliffe-Brown, meanwhile, tended to focus more on abstract structures rather than the lived experiences of individuals.
The ideas of nineteenth-century anthropologists had a profound impact on the theories of twentieth-century anthropologists. Evolutionism shaped the early development of anthropology, providing a narrow focus on ‘primitive’ and ‘savage’ societies. However, the work of Malinowski, Durkheim, and Radcliffe-Brown helped to overcome these limitations, providing a range of theoretical frameworks and methodologies that allowed for a more nuanced understanding of social phenomena. The continuities and differences between the theories of these different theorists shaped the development of social anthropology as a discipline, and have continued to influence the work of anthropologists to this day.
