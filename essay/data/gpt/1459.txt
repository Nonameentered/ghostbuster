Cohesion and ambiguity are two of the most important elements of any literary work that require ample attention. An effective author must have these qualities, and they should know the techniques that can help them achieve it. Two of these techniques are graphological and semantic deviation, which are commonly used by authors to create a sense of unity or ambiguity in their works. These techniques also utilize sound patterning as a cohesive device that helps tie everything together. This essay will examine "Pan Recipe" by Elizabeth Bishop and "New World A-Comin'" by Langston Hughes to explore how these authors utilized these techniques.
The poem "Pan Recipe" by Elizabeth Bishop is a unique and intriguing work of poetry. The poem is unusual in that it is only four lines long, yet it is powerful and evocative. The poem uses graphological deviation to create cohesion in the work. The title of the poem is "Pan Recipe," and the first line begins with the word "homemade." This use of the term "homemade" immediately grabs the reader's attention, as it implies that the recipe is unique and something special. Furthermore, the poem's second line repeats the word "homemade," this time with an added emphasis on the word "its." This repetition of the word helps to create a more cohesive feeling in the poem as it ties the two lines together. The final two lines of the poem are also linked by repetition. The phrase "I have never eaten" is repeated twice. By repeating this phrase, the poem creates a loop, which helps to tie the poem's ideas together.
In contrast, the poem "New World A-Comin'" by Langston Hughes is a much longer poem than "Pan Recipe," but it also takes advantage of graphological and semantic deviation. The poem's title alone shows this deviation, as it uses a non-standard spelling of "coming." The use of an apostrophe and the stylized spelling of the word "coming" is a deviation from the norm that highlights the uniqueness of the poem. Similarly, the poem's opening line is also a deviation from the norm. The line reads, "Well, well, well, and who's that yonder?" The line itself is a deviation from standard English because it uses repetition, and the phrase "who's that yonder" is non-standard. However, the repetition of "well" helps to unify the line and gives it a rhythmic quality.
Additionally, the poem utilizes semantic deviation to further tie the work together. The poem's sections all have unique titles, but they all relate to the themes of power, hope, and progress. For example, one section is titled "Black Power" and explores the idea of identity and pride. Another section is titled "John Henry," which is about the strength and perseverance of African Americans. By using these unique but related titles, the poem creates unity within itself.
Finally, both "Pan Recipe" and "New World A-Comin'" utilize sound patterning as a cohesive device. In "Pan Recipe," the repetition of the word "homemade" and the phrase "I have never eaten" create a rhythmic pattern. By repeating these phrases, the poem gains momentum, making it read smoother and unifying it at the same time. In "New World A-Comin'," the poem uses repetition and rhyme to create a unifying sound pattern. For example, the lines "Well, well, well / And what do we have here?" use repetition to create a catchy and rhythmic sound. Similarly, the lines "Goin' down that dusty road / My weary eyes to close" use both internal and end-rhyme to create a cohesive sound pattern.
In conclusion, Elizabeth Bishop's "Pan Recipe" and Langston Hughes's "New World A-Comin'" are two examples of poetry that use graphological and semantic deviation and sound patterning as cohesive devices. By using these techniques, the authors create works that are both coherent and ambiguous, which is a powerful technique in the world of literature. The deviation from standard English and the use of repetition and rhyme creates a unique rhythm that allows the work to flow smoothly and unifies the work at the same time. These techniques also allow the author to explore complex issues in their work, such as identity, power, and progress. All of this comes together to create a truly unique and thought-provoking work of poetry.
