In the book, "Seeing Voices," Oliver Sacks speaks about his experiences studying the deaf culture using participant observation. The book highlights various aspects of the deaf community that one may not have been exposed to prior to reading the book. His perspective sheds light on the deaf culture and the intricacies of the language used within it. Sacks' experiences were fruitful, but he faced several challenges in conducting his research.
Participant observation is a research methodology that involves embedding oneself in the social setting one wishes to study. In Sacks' case, he immersed himself in the deaf community, learned American Sign Language (ASL), and interacted with members of the community frequently over a period of time. He aimed to understand their language, traditions, and culture deeply. His experiences allowed for an in-depth perspective of the world of the deaf, which he was able to share with readers.
The author describes his experience using participant observation to study deaf culture as both challenging and enlightening. He highlights the fact that learning ASL is vital to understanding the deaf culture. ASL is a complex language with its grammar, vocabulary, and syntax. It is different from spoken English, and one needs to learn a new set of rules to interact with the deaf. Sacks states that "survival in the deaf community depended on knowing the language well," and this quickly became apparent to him.
One of the main challenges Sacks faced in participant observation was trying to get used to communicating through sign language. It is quite different from normal conversation, and one needs a certain level of proficiency to converse seamlessly. At first, he found himself constantly translating everything being signed to English in his head. This made conversations extremely slow and difficult. However, over time, he became more comfortable speaking in ASL and started to learn the nuances of the language. This made him appreciate the complexity of ASL and its ability to convey ideas clearly.
Another challenge Sacks faced was gaining the trust of the people he was studying. He talks about how the deaf community is a tight-knit group, and they tend to be suspicious of outsiders. They typically do not appreciate people coming into their community to learn about them superficially. Therefore, it was vital that Sacks immersed himself in their community and showed a genuine interest in their culture. Building trust took time, but once he had proven himself to be a true ally, people became more open to him.
Sacks states that "the deaf community had a deep-seated mistrust of the hearing world." They have experienced years of oppression and neglect, which has led to a feeling that the hearing community has not done enough to understand and help them. Therefore, it was critical to approach the study with sensitivity, not to be intrusive, and respect the privacy of the people he was studying. This necessitated his need to learn ASL and interact with people in their comfort zone, as opposed to the other way around.
Finally, one of the most challenging parts of Sacks' participant observation study was confronting his presumptions and biases. Growing up with the notion that deafness is a medical condition that needs to be corrected led him to approach his study from a medical standpoint initially. This caused him to overlook the richness and complexity of the deaf culture. However, through engaging with members of the deaf community daily, he was able to deconstruct his beliefs and see deafness as a unique linguistic and cultural identity.
Conclusively, Oliver Sacks' experience using participant observation to study the deaf culture was an eye-opener. Through his interactions with members of the deaf community, he was able to learn and appreciate their language, culture, and traditions. However, his study was not without challenges. He had to learn a new language, build trust, navigate cultural barriers and confront his biases. Overall, his experiences offer insight to researchers willing to immerse themselves in other cultures and traditions, emphasizing the importance of sensitivity, respect, patience, and openness in such endeavors.
