Contractual agreements are the backbone of business transactions and enable parties to conduct business securely. Any agreement must be entered with a level of trust, respect, and confidence to protect the interests and rights of the parties involved. Contracts involve an offer, acceptance, and consideration, and there are specific conditions that must be fulfilled for any contract to be legally binding. This essay will explore the six necessary conditions that must be fulfilled to create a contract, how an invitation to tender differs from an offer, the rules regarding acceptance, revocation, and communication through post, and why Workwell Ltd cannot take legal actions towards Drainklear. Additionally, we will discuss what they should consider with regards to their contract with Highroad plc and the search for a sub-contractor.
The six necessary conditions for a contract to be legally binding include an offer, acceptance, consideration, certainty, intention to create legal relations, and capacity. An offer is an expression of willingness to enter into a legally binding agreement, while acceptance of that offer is a clear indication of the intention to accept the exact terms that the offer prescribes. Consideration refers to a promise to do or refrain from doing an act, usually requiring some value in exchange. Certainty refers to the common understanding of the terms of the contract. The intention to create legal relations is the understanding that the parties intend to be legally bound by the contract. Capacity involves the parties’ ability to enter into a legally binding agreement. These six conditions must be fulfilled to create a legal and binding agreement.
An invitation to tender is an invitation for interested parties to bid on an expanding opportunity rather than an offer to enter into a contract. An invitation to tender is not an offer; it is an invitation to consider making an offer. The key difference is that an invitation to tender is a request to receive offers, and therefore, it does not hold any legal obligation to accept any of the bids. Conversely, an offer is a willingness to contract on certain terms and is legally binding.
Acceptance, revocation, and communication through post are crucial components of the contractual offer. Acceptance is the clear indication of the offer that is accepted by the offeror. Crucially, the acceptance must unequivocally mirror the offer. It must be made in the same mode of communication as the offer, such as orally, in writing, or by performance. A revocation of the offer occurs when the offeror withdraws the offer. This typically occurs before acceptance; however, it can be withdrawn before acceptance if notice of withdrawal is communicated to the offeree. Communication through post means that an acceptance is effective when it is sent, not when it is received. For example, if the offeror posts a letter of acceptance, it usually becomes effective when it is posted, even if it has not yet been received.
In the given case study, Workwell seeks to take legal action against Drainklear for breaking a contractual agreement to provide temporary workers and is now demanding payment for breach of contract. However, the legal action cannot be pursued for several reasons. Firstly, the issue at hand must be considered, and there must be clarity over the conditions of the contract, including the terms of a termination of the agreement. Furthermore, given that the contract was entered verbally, there is the possibility of a disagreement over the terms and conditions, making it difficult to prove the existence of the contract. Lastly, Workwell delayed in pursuing legal action, and it is considered inequitable to hold Drainklear responsible for their breach of contract without making the matter clear previously. The best option for Workwell would be to seek arbitration to resolve the issue, especially if it is without clarity.
Regarding Workwell’s contract with Highroad plc and the search for a sub-contractor, a few considerations should be taken. Firstly, it should be ensured that the new provider is reliable and capable of meeting the contractual requirements. The provider should be communicated to explicitly regarding the terms of the agreement. Again, the conditions of termination and cancellation should be set out clearly in the contract as ambiguities should be avoided. The sub-contractor should be identified as an independent contractor and should be protected under The Equality Act. Moreover, the contract should protect the parties from financial penalties or liquidated damages if there is a breach of the agreement. It is best if arbitration is also provided for, having a neutral third party to resolve any issues that arise. 
In conclusion, six critical conditions must be fulfilled for any contract to be binding. An invitation to tender is different from an offer in that it is an invitation for offers rather than an offer. Acceptance, revocation, and communication through post play critical roles in the contractual offer. In regards to the case study of Workwell and their contract with Drainklear, legal action cannot be pursued for several reasons, and the best option for Workwell would be to seek arbitration. Workwell should consider several things regarding their contract with Highroad plc and the search for a sub-contractor, including ensuring the new provider's reliability and capability, setting clear conditions of termination, and protecting both parties from financial penalties or liquidated damages in the event of a breach of the agreement.
