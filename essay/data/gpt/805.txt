Introduction
Class is a vital element of society, and it is identified as the social order according to the degree of riches, power, and status of individuals. Travel and leisure activities are regarded as fundamental components of human life because they offer an opportunity to unwind, explore, and interact with people from different cultures. Social class has been a traditional determinant of travel behavior and tourism activity. Wealthy individuals or people from high social status have always been able to travel more frequently and enjoy more luxurious travel experiences compared to people with lower incomes. However, the issue of traditional models of social class with respect to international travel and tourism has been a topic of concern. The purpose of this essay is to examine the relevance of traditional models of social class when examining international travel as a leisure activity and to explore whether inequalities exist in international tourism.
Traditional Models of Social Class and International Travel as a Leisure Activity
Traditional models of social class have played a significant role in shaping the behavior of individuals towards tourism and travel activities. The term social class refers to the socio-cultural stratification of individuals in society and the influence it has on their access to resources and opportunities. Social class is still relevant when examining international travel as a leisure activity, primarily because it determines the degree of access individuals have to financial resources. In the global travel sector, people from high social classes are considered as powerful consumers, and the tourism and travel industry has designed products and services that cater to their needs. These people are considered capable of traveling whenever they want and wherever they choose to go, and they are also seen as trendsetters in the industry. On the other hand, people from low social classes are seen as budget travelers, and they are more likely to select destinations based on financial affordability rather than preferences.
The traditional model of social class is still relevant in the travel and tourism sector because it gives insights on the kinds of products and services individuals should develop to offer the best travel experiences. The luxury travel sector, for instance, has always been associated with high social elitism as these services are highly prices. These services cater to the specific tastes of individuals from higher social classes who demand personalized attention and exclusive services that are not available for the average tourist. These products and services have been developed specifically to provide opulent experiences that can top anything else offered within the industry. As a result, social class is still relevant in the travel and tourism sector because it helps businesses to understand the attitudes, behavior, and preferences of different consumer segments, which helps in creating targeted marketing and advertising campaigns.
Evidence Supporting the Presence of Inequalities in International Tourism
Inequalities in international tourism are evident, and various forms of research have explored the relationship between social class and travel behavior. The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) acknowledges that tourism has the potential to create immense some social-economic benefits when adequately harnessed, but at the same time, it recognizes that tourism can amplify inequalities that already exist. Studies have shown that people from higher social classes have more opportunities to travel internationally compared to low-income earners. According to Dwyer and Kim (2003), people from high-income households are more than 50% more likely to travel international compared to low-income households. The main reason for this scenario is that travel is viewed as a luxury rather than a necessity. Moreover, people from low-income households find it difficult to allocate resources necessary to support international travel, such as taking time off work or accumulating disposable income to cover travel expenses.
Furthermore, the service offerings within the tourism industry are tailored to the needs of the upper social classes, and the travel opportunities available for high-income earners tend to be superior to those available for low-income individuals. The higher social classes have access to opulent travel experiences, including private jets, private tours, and VIP access compared to budget packages available to low-income earners. The experiences offered by luxury travel reinforces the social divide and further marginalizes people from lower social classes.
However, it is important to acknowledge that there is also a significant share of low-income earners that participate in international travel. For instance, according to the World Tourism Organization, middle and low-class earners make up approximately 75% of all international arrivals. This is because global travel has become more accessible and more affordable with the advent of budget travel products. However, these products cater to people who are more willing to sacrifice quality, luxury, and exclusivity in exchange for affordability, which still creates a social divide.
Conclusion
In conclusion, traditional models of social class are still relevant in international travel as a leisure activity. Social class has been an integral component of the tourism and travel industry as it influences the travel behavior of individuals. The tourism industry has designed products and services that cater to the needs of people from high social classes, while budget products and services have been developed to cater to the needs of people from low-income earners. However, inequalities exist in the industry, which is evident in terms of access to resources and service offerings. Despite the challenges, international travel remains a fundamental aspect of human life as it offers numerous benefits that transcend financial and social divides. Therefore, it is important to explore ways to reduce these inequalities and make travel and tourism more accessible to all individuals regardless of social class.
