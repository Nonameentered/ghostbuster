Introduction:
Language is a fascinating and complex system of communication that humans use to express their thoughts, feelings, and ideas. Among the features that make up this linguistic system are tense and aspect. Tense refers to the grammatical category that indicates the time of an event or state described by a verb, while aspect is used to show the internal structure of an event or state. In English, there are three main approaches to tense, namely, the traditional view, the functionalist view, and the structuralist view. In this essay, we will explore these three approaches, and we will examine how they differ from each other. We will also consider whether tense is a matter of time or syntax and provide examples to support our arguments.
The Three Main Approaches to Tense:
The traditional view of tense is the oldest and most widely accepted approach. It holds that English has only two tenses- past and present- which are used to refer to events or states that have already occurred or are happening now, respectively. This approach also distinguishes between simple and continuous forms of the present and past tenses, which are used to show whether an event or state is ongoing or completed. For example, "I am eating breakfast" is in the present continuous tense, while "I eat breakfast" is in the present simple tense. Similarly, "I was eating breakfast" is in the past continuous tense, while "I ate breakfast" is in the past simple tense.
The functionalist view of tense is a newer approach that focuses on the communicative function of tense in different contexts. This approach asserts that tense is more than just a grammatical category that indicates the time of an event or state but also has a pragmatic function. According to functionalists, the choice of tense in a sentence is determined by the speaker's purpose, the listener's knowledge, and the discourse context. For example, in a conversation where the speaker wants to report a past event, but the listener is unaware of it, the speaker may use the present tense to make the event seem more vivid and immediate. Here is an example of the functionalist approach to tense:
Joanna and her husband Joe are planning a trip to the mountains. Joanna is looking at the weather forecast for the area, and she tells Joe "It snows a lot in December." In this case, Joanna uses the present simple tense to describe something that is not happening now but is certain to happen in the future based on her experience or knowledge of the area.
The structuralist view of tense is a linguistic approach that focuses on the syntactic structure of tense and its relation to other elements in a sentence. According to this approach, tense is not a separate category but an aspect of a verb that is manifested through its inflectional morphology. In other words, tense is seen as a combination of several grammatical categories, including aspect, voice, mood, and person, that interact with each other to convey the time of an event or state. For example, "I had eaten breakfast" is in the past perfect tense, where 'had' is the auxiliary verb that expresses the past time, and 'eaten' is the past participle form of eat.
Differences between the Traditional, Functionalist, and Structuralist Views:
The traditional view of tense emphasizes the temporal aspect of language and sees tense as a fixed set of grammatical categories that describe the time of an event or state. It believes that tense is a clear and straightforward feature of language that is easy to identify and use. In contrast, the functionalist approach to tense emphasizes the pragmatic aspect of language and argues that tense is not limited to its temporal function but also has social and contextual functions. This view suggests that speakers use tense to signal their attitude to the situation or to convey information about the speaker's perspective on the event or state described in a sentence. Finally, the structuralist approach to tense emphasizes the syntactic aspect of language and sees tense as a product of the complex interaction of various grammatical categories.
Is Tense a Matter of Time or Syntax?
The question of whether tense is a matter of time or syntax has been a topic of debate among linguists for many years. The traditional view of tense sees it primarily as a matter of time, while the functionalist and structuralist approaches view it as more of a matter of syntax. The traditional view believes that tense reflects the time of the event or state described in a sentence, while the functionalist approach argues that tense reflects the speaker's intentions and expectations in language use. The structuralist approach, on the other hand, sees tense as an aspect of the verb's syntax, which interacts with other grammatical categories to convey meaning.
Examples to Support the Arguments:
Examples from the traditional view: 
1. Present simple: "I drink coffee every morning."
2. Past simple: "She finished her essay last night."
Examples from the functionalist view:
1. Present simple: "The sun rises in the east." (A universal truth)
2. Present continuous: "I'm obviously not finishing my work by the deadline." (The speaker wants to convey dissatisfaction)
Examples from the structuralist view:
1. Present perfect: "Mary has eaten dinner." (The auxiliary verb 'has' interacts with the past participle form of 'eat' to convey the notion of a completed action)
2. Past perfect continuous: "She had been singing for an hour when I arrived." (The auxiliary verb 'had' interacts with the past participle and present participle of 'sing' to convey the notion of a completed ongoing action.)
Conclusion:
In conclusion, tense is an essential aspect of English grammar, and it has been studied from different perspectives over the years. The traditional view of tense emphasizes the temporal aspect of language, while the functionalist and structuralist views focus on other aspects of language such as pragmatics and syntax, respectively. Tense is not only about the time of an event or state, but it also reflects the speaker's intentions and expectations in language use. So, whether tense is a matter of time or syntax is not clear-cut, and it depends on the perspective you take. Therefore, it is essential to have a broad understanding of tense and to consider its many functions and interactions with other language features.
