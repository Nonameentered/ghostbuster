The experiment using 100mL standard solutions prepared by serial dilution of 0.1M NaF solution and saturated solutions of each MgF showed promising results. The concentration of fluoride ions in each solution was measured with the fluoride ion selective electrode. It was observed that the concentration of fluoride ions decreased with an increase in the concentration of magnesium ions.
Temperature was an important factor in the calculations. The electrode response is temperature-dependent, and therefore, all measurements were taken at a constant temperature. The temperature was monitored using a thermometer and was recorded along with the measurement of the fluoride concentration. The recorded temperature was then used to calculate the corrected fluoride concentration.
The process for using the fluoride ion selective electrode involved calibrating the electrode with buffer solutions of known fluoride concentrations. The electrode was then dipped into the sample solution, and the fluoride concentration was measured. The concentration was corrected for temperature and expressed in terms of millimoles of fluoride.
In conclusion, the experiment demonstrated the relationship between fluoride and magnesium ions in solution. Temperature was taken into account, and the fluoride ion selective electrode provided accurate and reliable results. Overall, the experiment was successful in achieving its objectives.
