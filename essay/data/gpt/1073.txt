In Rome, public image was everything, especially when it came to power and authority. Augustus was well aware of this fact, and he used various mediums to portray his image as divine or semi-divine, which helped maintain his authority and power among the Roman people. This essay explores how Augustus utilized public mediums like statues, altars, coinage, and literature to project an image of himself as being between man and god in order to maintain power in Roman society.
Augustus was very strategic in the way he utilized public mediums to maintain his power. He used statues as a tool to symbolize the divine nature of his rule. One example is the statue of Augustus found on the Ara Pacis in Rome. The statue portrays Augustus as a divine figure, with his right arm raised in a gesture of blessing, and wearing the traditional military costume known as the cuirass. This statue was designed to convey his authority as a leader and as a divine figure.
Another example is the Prima Porta statue, which was discovered in 1863 in the villa of Livia Drusilla, Augustus's wife. In the statue, Augustus is depicted as a Roman general, with a breastplate covered in scenes from mythology, and is holding a spear in his right hand. The statue was designed to convey his military prowess and the fact that he was a divine leader protecting Rome.
Augustus was also careful about the images he used on coinage. Coins were critical in Ancient Rome, as they were used as a medium of exchange for trade and commerce. Augustus used coins to promote himself as a wise and just ruler who was a protector of Roman society. For example, one of the coins that was minted in his honor shows him on the obverse with his head facing the right wearing a laurel wreath. On the reverse side, the coin shows a large oak tree, a symbol of strength, with an image of a sow nursing its young beneath it. Augustus used this image to symbolize Rome’s prosperity and the growth of its people—a clear message of his successful and benevolent leadership.
In addition to using these mediums to portray himself as a god, Augustus took a pragmatic approach to religion and cults in his era. He was careful to restore religion and cults within Roman society while at the same time not introducing the concept of a ruler as a god, thereby avoiding being perceived as a tyrannical ruler, which Rome had rejected in its recent past. Augustus believed that religion could be a tool for national unity and support, and so he encouraged and funded the restoration of temples and cults in Rome. Through this, Augustus was able to appease the Roman people's desire for peace and piety and ensure his political power, and at the same time, project himself as a figure that respected traditional religious customs.
Augustus was also strategic in changing his name from Gaius Octavius Thurinus to Imperator Caesar Divi Filius. By taking a new name as the “Son of god,” he was projecting himself as someone whose divine ancestry traced back to the first ruler of Rome, Romulus and was therefore a divinely chosen successor. Augustus wanted the people of Rome to view him as the rightful and legitimate ruler of the Roman Empire, and by suggesting his divine parentage, he was gaining a measure of divine legitimacy.
Another way Augustus attempted to secure his divine stature was by changing the name of Sextilis, the month in which he was born, to August in his honor. The name was used to affirm his divine status, as it was the month in which he defeated Antony and became the undisputed ruler of the Roman world. The month of his birth, in honor of his divine status, served as not only a reminder but also as a tool of propaganda to elevate his image among the populace. This change also indicated the significant impact he had on Roman society and ensured that his name would be recognized and remembered hundreds of years later.
In conclusion, Augustus used various public mediums to project an image of himself as being between man and god, which not only helped maintain his power and authority in Roman society but also fought any possibility of being perceived as a tyrannical ruler. By carefully using religious customs and propaganda, Augustus secured his position in history as a smart and visionary ruler who used the public mediums to his advantage. His strategic use of statues and coinage, as well as his name and month, further solidified his divine image. Augustus played his image very well, creating an image that has lasted throughout time, ensuring that he is still considered one of the great leaders in Roman history.
