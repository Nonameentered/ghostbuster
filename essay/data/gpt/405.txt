The case regarding the retention of fingerprints, DNA samples, and DNA profiles under s64(1A) of the Police and Criminal Evidence (PACE) Act 1984 raised important issues concerning civil liberties, human rights and fair justice. It questioned the legality of retaining DNA samples and profiles of individuals, even if they had been acquitted of the crime charged against them. The case went before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), which considered its compatibility with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) 1950. This essay will examine the main issues discussed in the case and analyze the majority and dissenting opinions on the engagement of Article 8(1), the justification for retention, whether there was any breach of Article 14 and the compatibility of s64(1A) with the Convention.
The case in question involved two British nationals, Mr. S and Mr. Marper, who had been arrested on separate occasions for unrelated crimes. They were both charged, but later acquitted. However, the police retained their DNA samples and profiles in accordance with s64(1A) of PACE, which permits the authorities to hold genetic material of individuals even if they have not been convicted of a crime for an indeterminate period. Messrs S and Marper applied to domestic courts to have their samples and profiles destroyed, but their claims were dismissed. They then submitted a complaint to the ECtHR, arguing that their human rights had been violated under Articles 8, 11, and 14 of the Convention.
The main issue discussed in the case was whether the retention of genetic material of individuals who had been acquitted of a crime was compatible with the ECHR's provisions. Article 8 of the Convention states that everyone has the right to respect for their private and family life, home, and correspondence. The applicants claimed that retaining their DNA samples and profiles violated this right, which the respondent government contested. The government argued that the retention of such materials was necessary to fight against crime and that it reduced the number of wrongful arrests.
The majority decision concluded that the retention of genetic material of individuals acquitted of a crime engaged Article 8(1) of the Convention. They accepted that the retention of such materials interfered with the applicants' right to privacy and noted that "the mere storage of DNA profiles involves the processing of personal data." However, the majority's opinion was that the interference was justified under Article 8(2) of the Convention, which allows for the interference of individuals' human rights if it is necessary for a legitimate aim. The majority found that the retention of DNA was essential in protecting the public from harm, preventing crime, and was, therefore, a proportionate measure.
The majority supported their theoretical argument further by providing specific examples of criminal cases where DNA matching was critical in identifying, convicting, and punishing perpetrators of criminal offenses. They argued that DNA profiles were unique, and retaining them allowed for the identification of repeat offenders who would otherwise have gone undetected. Furthermore, the retention of DNA profiles was an essential tool in identifying missing persons, protecting public safety, and providing closure for victims of crimes.
The majority's justification for the retention of such materials rested on the premise that DNA profiles are unique to individuals and can even identify a person's ethnicity and medical conditions. It was, therefore, essential to retain such genetic material to complete data banks for investigative purposes that would aid in speeding up the investigation process and prevent unnecessary arrests. The majority also emphasized that the retention of such material was necessary to prevent parallel investigations that may have led to wasted time and resources that could otherwise be put to better use.
There was no breach of Article 14 of the Convention, which prohibits discrimination, as the majority noted. The retention provisions under s64(1A) of PACE treated everyone in the same manner. There was no discrimination between individuals who were subsequently acquitted and those found guilty. As a result, the retention did not prejudice the applicant's rights or amount to disparate treatment. 
The verdict on the compatibility of s64(1A) with the Convention was clear. The majority found that the retention of DNA samples and profiles did not violate the Convention's provisions. It was a proportionate measure and necessary in the fight against crime. The retention of such materials was not discriminatory, nor did it prejudice the rights of individuals. The majority agreed that the authorities' use of DNA was a vital tool to curb crime and protect the common good, despite the infringement on the applicants' right to privacy.
However, the dissenting opinion differed on the matter. The dissent focused on the proportionality of the retention of DNA samples and profiles by authorities and noted that Parliament had not provided a specific time limit for retention. They further argued that retention, irrespective of guilt, may lead to wrongful arrests and investigations, particularly for minorities. The dissent warned that DNA retention could lead to disproportionate targeting, profiling, and criminalization of minorities, breaching their rights to privacy and freedom security.
In conclusion, the case regarding the retention of fingerprints, DNA samples, and DNA profiles under s64(1A) of the Police and Criminal Evidence (PACE) Act 1984 brought up significant issues regarding human rights, privacy, and civil liberties. The majority concluded that the retention was compatible with the ECHR's provisions and that it was necessary to fight against crime and protect the common good. The majority, however, emphasized that the retention must be used proportionately and must not discriminate against minorities. The dissenting opinion focused on the proportionality of the retention of DNA samples and profiles and warned of potential discrimination against minorities. In all, the case highlighted the importance of balancing privacy, security, and protection in a democratic society.
