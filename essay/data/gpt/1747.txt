Robert Venturi’s Sainsbury Wing extension to the National Gallery in London is a landmark piece of architecture that is widely celebrated for its innovative design. Completed in 1991, the extension added a new dimension to the existing building and created a unique space that seamlessly blends in with the historical architecture of the surrounding area. It is evident that Venturi drew inspiration from a range of sources in his design, including historical architecture, contemporary art, and everyday objects. This essay sets out to explore these sources of inspiration and design influences, and how Venturi incorporated them into his finished design.
When Venturi was first approached to design the extension to the National Gallery, he was acutely aware of the sensitivity of the site and the need to create a design that would complement the existing architecture. The brief stipulated that the extension should be a significant building that was sensitive to its context, and it was Venturi’s challenge to come up with a design that met these requirements. To this end, Venturi drew inspiration from a range of sources, including the architectural history of London, the work of other architects and artists, and the vernacular architecture of everyday life.
One of the most significant sources of inspiration for Venturi was the architectural history of London. The city is renowned for its rich architectural heritage, and Venturi was keen to draw on this history to create a design that was both modern and respectful of its context. In particular, he was inspired by the Victorian and Edwardian buildings that line the streets around the National Gallery, and the eclectic mix of styles that characterizes these buildings.
Incorporating this inspiration into his design, Venturi created a façade that is composed of a series of interconnected arches, which echo the arches of the existing building. This use of arches is a hallmark of the Victorian era and serves to create a sense of continuity between the old and new architecture. The façade is clad in Portland stone, which is a traditional building material that is widely used in London. This choice of material helps to ensure that the extension blends seamlessly into its context.
Venturi was also influenced by the work of other architects and artists, particularly those associated with the postmodern movement. In the 1980s, postmodernism was a dominant trend in architecture, and Venturi was one of its leading proponents. The movement was characterized by a rejection of the modernist aesthetic of the 1950s and 1960s and a return to historical styles and ornamentation. The movement was also marked by an interest in popular culture and a critique of the elitism of high art.
In the Sainsbury Wing, Venturi drew on these ideas to create a design that was playful and subversive. One of the most striking features of the extension is the entrance, which is marked by a large, colorful banner. The banner features the words “Sainsbury Wing” written in bold, playful lettering. This use of typography is a hallmark of postmodernism and serves to highlight the importance of graphic design in the built environment.
Another example of Venturi’s engagement with popular culture can be seen in the design of the windows on the façade of the extension. The windows are arranged in a seemingly random pattern, which creates a sense of movement and dynamism. This pattern is inspired by the design of a popular children’s toy, the Etch A Sketch, and serves to create an element of fun in the design.
In addition to drawing on the history of architecture and contemporary art, Venturi was also influenced by the vernacular architecture of everyday life. He was fascinated by the way in which ordinary buildings and objects were designed to meet specific functional requirements, and he sought to incorporate this idea into his designs.
In the Sainsbury Wing, Venturi’s interest in the vernacular is evident in the way in which he has organized the spaces within the building. The galleries are arranged around a central atrium, which serves as a meeting place and a focal point for visitors. The atrium is designed to resemble a traditional market hall, with stalls and booths arranged around the perimeter. This arrangement creates a sense of informality and intimacy, which is in contrast to the formality of the exhibition spaces.
Venturi was also interested in the way in which ordinary objects could be transformed into works of art through the process of design. In the Sainsbury Wing, he used this idea to create a series of sculptural elements that are integrated into the fabric of the building. One of the most striking of these elements is the cornice that runs around the top of the façade. This cornice is composed of a series of elaborately carved scallops, which resemble the folds of a curtain. This design was inspired by the idea of the façade as a stage set, and serves to create a sense of drama and theatricality.
In conclusion, Robert Venturi’s Sainsbury Wing extension to the National Gallery in London is a landmark piece of architecture that is admired for its innovative design. Venturi drew inspiration from a range of sources in his design, including the architectural history of London, contemporary art, and the vernacular architecture of everyday life. He incorporated these influences into his finished design through the use of arches, Portland stone, typography, window patterns, and sculptural elements. By doing so, he succeeded in creating a building that is both modern and respectful of its context, and that has become an iconic symbol of London’s vibrant cultural scene.
