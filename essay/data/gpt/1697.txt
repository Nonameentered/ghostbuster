Revenue management is a widely utilized practice in the hospitality industry that focuses on maximizing revenue for hotels by managing inventory and pricing strategies. Effective revenue management can have a significant impact on guest satisfaction and revenue generation. However, there are two key issues identified in the academic literature that can impact the effectiveness of revenue management strategies. The two main issues identified in the literature are the challenges of data management and the influence of ethical considerations on revenue management practices. This essay aims to discuss these issues and evaluate their impact on guest satisfaction and revenue maximization at a specific hotel, the Marriott International.
The first issue that has been reported in academic literature concerning the effective application of revenue management in hotels is the challenge of data management. Data management is essential for revenue management since revenue managers need accurate and up-to-date information to optimize hotel inventory and pricing strategies. However, managing data in the hospitality industry is complex due to the diversity of sources and types of data. One of the challenges is the large volume of information available from various channels, including reservation systems, social media, loyalty programs, and other third-party platforms. As a result, managing data effectively requires adequate infrastructure, skilled professionals, and reliable technology.
To manage data effectively, Marriott International has invested in state-of-the-art technology and personnel with expertise in data analysis. The hotel uses several data sources, including Marriott International's global reservation system, social media platforms, and web analytics. From this data, Marriott International can collect valuable insights on customer preferences, booking trends, and competitor analysis. Additionally, the hotel uses technology to monitor guests and track their behavior and preferences. This information is utilized to optimize pricing strategies and develop guest profiles that can enhance future stays. In doing so, Marriott International maximizes its revenue while ensuring effective guest service.
However, even with such a vast data pool, there is a possibility that information can be compromised. One way the hotel can minimize the risk of data breaches is by having strict and rigid data security protocols, including data encryption, multi-layer access controls, and firewalls. By following such protocols, Marriott International maintains compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). It ensures the security of guest data, and ultimately, guest satisfaction.
The second issue reported in academic literature is the influence of ethical considerations on revenue management practices. The practice of revenue management has raised concerns about the ethics of pricing strategies that may disadvantage some consumers. For instance, differential pricing, where prices are different based on demand, can make the pricing of some services unaffordable, leading to reduced guest satisfaction. Therefore, concerns about ethical considerations have led to calls for revenue management practices to be transparent and fair, with clear pricing policies that emphasize fairness and ethical values.
To address ethical concerns, Marriott International has implemented a dynamic pricing strategy that is transparent and ethical. The pricing strategy weighs customer demand, seasonality, and inventory levels. A flexible pricing approach is applied such that the rates can change on a daily basis. This approach eliminates the potential for predatory pricing practices, where guests may be unknowingly charged more due to limited availability. The hotel's transparent approach to revenue management helps promote fairness to all guests who have an opportunity to get the same services at the same price depending on the demand.
Furthermore, Marriott International operates ethically by adhering to the company standards regarding ethical business practices. It has policies that foster respect and morality among its employees. Moreover, it is committed to sustainability and social responsibility, which is illustrated through environmentally friendly services, philanthropic partnerships, and corporate citizenship programs. Marriott International's ethical and sustainable policies ensure that the guest experience is not only financially fair but also morally upright and ambient, promoting customer satisfaction.
The impact of these two issues on revenue maximization and guest satisfaction is significant. Effective data management ensures that the hotel has accurate data upon which revenue managers can base their decisions to optimize pricing strategies. This leads to increased revenue and profit maximization, which is essential for the success of the business. In the case of Marriott International, revenue management based on real-time data ensures efficient and effective service to clients that focus on customer experience, thereby maximizing customer satisfaction.
This is evident in Marriott International's success, where the hotel has solidified its position as a leader in the hospitality industry worldwide. In 2019, the hotel had over 13500 properties across 131 countries and 30 brands. Marriott International's revenue during this period was $20.97 bn, an 85% growth from 2015 when its revenue was $11.14 bn. This growth is a testament to the effectiveness of its revenue management strategies, which strive for optimization of resources while promoting customer satisfaction.
In conclusion, revenue management is an essential component of a hotel's operations, helping to maximize revenue and promote guest satisfaction. However, to ensure effective revenue management, it is crucial to manage data accurately and ethically. It is clear that the challenges of data management and ethical considerations have an impact on revenue maximization and guest satisfaction. Through the case study of Marriott International, we can see how data management and ethical concerns can be managed efficiently to enhance revenue maximization and guest satisfaction. By putting into consideration the two issues, hotels can adopt effective revenue management policies simultaneously offering quality services to clients while maximizing their revenue.
