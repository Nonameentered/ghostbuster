The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were established by United Nations in 2000 which aimed to reduce poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation, and gender inequality. The deadline for reaching these goals was 2015. Different web-based resources have emerged to provide information on developing countries progress in meeting the MDGs. This essay discusses some of these resources and their strengths and weaknesses in terms of the information they provide and their reliability.
One of the most reliable resources for MDGs information is UNICEF's website. UNICEF provides data and analysis on the progress of countries towards achieving the MDGs. The strengths of this resource are its accuracy and comprehensiveness. UNICEF's data is regarded as one of the most reliable sources of MDGs information. It updates its information on a regular basis and provides extensive data on each of the eight MDGs. Furthermore, the website is user-friendly and easy to navigate, making it easy for anyone to access the information. Despite these strengths, UNICEF's website can provide very in-depth information which can be difficult for some individuals to understand.
Another resource worth mentioning is the World Health Organization's (WHO) website. The WHO compiles data and publishes country reports on their progress to achieving the MDGs. The strength of this resource is that it provides extensive information on health-related issues and achievements in developing countries. WHO is well-known for its ability to collect and provide high-quality health-related data. This resource is very beneficial for those who want to comprehend the health-related goals of the MDGs. However, it can be hard for people to sort through all the data on the website since the site is not as user-friendly as UNICEF's.
The Millennium Development Goals website is another resource that provides MDGs information. This website was created by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The strength of this resource is that it provides an extensive overview of the MDGs, with straightforward data on the progress of goals in each country. Furthermore, individuals can use the data to make comparisons across countries. However, the website may not be detailed enough for researchers who require more in-depth information. Additionally, due to its simplicity, it may not always offer in-depth coverage of the achievements of different countries.
Another resource is the World Bank's website. The World Bank has vast resources that cover a range of MDG-related topics, including detailed analysis of each goal, data, and reports on the progress of the goals. The World Bank's reports are in-depth and generally reliable. However, the website can appear complex and confusing to the average person because it provides customized data that may not be needed by everyone. In addition, the data may have longer time intervals than needed by researchers who require up-to-date information.
Lastly, The Human Development Reports (HDRs) produced by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) are often seen as an essential resource for information on the progress of developing countries towards achieving the MDGs. The HDRs generate a lot of in-depth data and analysis on development issues, with the main focus on human development and the eradication of poverty. However, while the HDRs provide more in-depth anecdotal information, the extent of the data may not be enough for researchers who require more extensive data.
In conclusion, the web-based resources mentioned above offer an extensive amount of information on developing countries' progress towards meeting the MDGs. Each resource has its strengths and weaknesses in terms of the information they provide and their reliability. UNICEF and WHO provide comprehensive, accurate, and reliable data on the MDGs, but can be hard to navigate and comprehend due to the in-depth nature of their reports. The Millennium Development Goals website and World Bank's website provide straightforward data on goals progress but can be daunting to those requiring more detail. The Human Development Reports provide rich anecdotal information, but may not satisfy researchers who require more expansive data.
