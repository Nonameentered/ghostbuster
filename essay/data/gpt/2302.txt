The disconfirmation model of consumer satisfaction is a framework used to examine the gap between the expectations of a customer and the actual experience they have with a product or service. In essence, the model suggests that customer satisfaction is the result of a comparison between the perceived performance of a product or service and the expectations of that product or service. Specifically, if a product or service exceeds or meets expectations, it leads to satisfaction. If a product or service falls short of expectations, it leads to dissatisfaction. The framework can be applied to a wide range of industries, including the food market. 
The food market is an essential industry that impacts the daily lives of people around the world. The food industry encompasses a broad range of businesses from restaurants, fast food outlets, and grocery stores to food producers, farmers, and distributors. Given its wide reach, customer satisfaction is critical to the food market. Every time a customer visits a restaurant or grocery store, they come with some expectation of what they will eat or purchase. The disconfirmation model of consumer satisfaction is useful here because it allows us to examine how customers perceive their experience with the food market as a whole, and the specific expectations they bring regarding service, quality, price, variety, and other factors.
The disconfirmation model posits three states of consumer satisfaction: positive, negative, and neutral. A positive state is reached when customers perceive their expectations are met or exceeded. A negative state is attained when customers perceive their expectations are not met or are below the standard expected. And a neutral state is noted where customers believe their expectations were neither exceeded nor not met. In the food market, this model focuses on customer expectations regarding the quality of food, the variety of food, the service, the atmosphere of the business, the price, and other important factors surrounding the experience.
Quality is one of the primary factors that customers consider in the food market. Whether at a restaurant or buying groceries, the quality of the food is integral to customer satisfaction. Customer expectations vary based on many factors such as the price and previous dining experience. If the experience met their expectations or exceeded them, then customers are likely to be in a positive state of satisfaction. However, if the food quality is not up to par with the expectation of customer, it leads to dissatisfaction primarily. In the food market, it is essential that businesses keep a high-quality standard to foster customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Variety also plays a central role in customer satisfaction in the food market. Customers expect a wide range of choices when it comes to purchasing food. For example, if a restaurant's menu is limited, customers may feel unsatisfied as it may not cater to all their needs and desires. In contrast, if there are numerous options and varieties of the food on the menu, customers would leave satisfied and even willing to return. Therefore It is crucial for food businesses to understand the importance of variety and meet customer's expectations. 
Service quality is another critical factor in customer satisfaction in the food industry. Customers need to be treated with respect and care, starting from the time they come in the food outlet to the time they leave. The staff should be amiable, and they should make sure to address all customer queries promptly. Customers are likely to be in a positive state of satisfaction when their service expectations are met or exceeded. In contrast, customers can be dissatisfied if their expectations regarding service quality are not met or below expectations.
The atmosphere of the food outlet is also significant to customer satisfaction. Customers expect the environment of the food outlet to be comfortable, clean, and welcoming. The physical ambiance should be appealing to the customers. If the atmosphere is dingy, dirty, or uncomfortable, customers are likely to be in a negative state of satisfaction and may decide not to return. Therefore, food businesses must maintain a clean and comfortable atmosphere to ensure customer satisfaction.
Finally, the price of food is another essential factor in the food market. Customers have preconceived notions about the cost of food products based on various factors such as their previous dining experience or the type of dining outlet. If the price charged is within the expected range, customer satisfaction is likely to be positive. However, if the price of the food is seen as too high, customers may end up in a negative state of satisfaction. Additionally, if the prices are seen as exceedingly low, customers may question the quality and taste of the food. Therefore, the prices should be set where they cater to customer expectations and meet the standards they anticipate. 
In conclusion, The disconfirmation model of consumer satisfaction is a useful framework to understand how customers perceive their expectations in the food market. Different factors such as Quality, Variety, Service, Atmosphere, and Price are integral to meeting customer expectations. If expectations are met or exceeded, customers are likely to leave in a satisfied state, leading to brand loyalty and even referrals. Alternatively, if expectations are not met, customers can become dissatisfied, leading to a reduction of brand loyalty and a decrease in revenue. It is, therefore, critical for food businesses to understand the disconfirmation model of consumer satisfaction and create a product or service that consistently meets or exceeds the expectations of customers for the long-term benefit of their business.
