Solar energy is becoming an increasingly popular choice for providing reliable and efficient electricity to communities around the world. There are a variety of solar cell types available, each with their own unique benefits and drawbacks. In this essay, we will explore the most efficient and cost-effective solar cell types for a proposed PV (photovoltaic) array on a sloping roof near Reading, UK. We will also evaluate the annual yield and cost of electricity produced with different cell types and compare the projects’ energy output with the optimum output and with an identical array in Benin, Nigeria. Lastly, we will assess the potential profit and funding available for the project.
The proposed PV array will be built on a sloping roof in Reading, UK, where the climate is generally mild with an average of 1682 hours of sunshine a year and annual precipitation ranging from about 525-800 mm. The primary purpose of the array is to generate electricity for the building it is attached to. In order to determine the most efficient and cost-effective type of solar cell to use, we must first understand how solar cells work.
Solar cells work by converting sunlight into direct current electricity. The most commonly used solar cell types include monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film solar cells. Monocrystalline solar cells are made from a single crystal of silicon and are the most efficient type of solar cell, with an efficiency rate of up to 22%. However, they are also the most expensive. Polycrystalline solar cells are made from multiple crystals of silicon and have an efficiency rate of around 15%. They are less expensive than monocrystalline solar cells, but they also have a lower efficiency rate. Thin-film solar cells are made from a variety of materials, including cadmium telluride and copper indium gallium selenide. They have an efficiency rate of around 10%, but they are the least expensive solar cell type.
Considering the climate in Reading, UK, the most efficient and cost-effective solar cell type to use would be polycrystalline solar cells. While monocrystalline solar cells may be more efficient, they are also much more expensive and may not provide a significant increase in energy production in the climate in Reading. Thin-film solar cells are less efficient than polycrystalline solar cells, which means more panels would be required to generate the same amount of electricity.
Using polycrystalline solar cells, the annual yield of the PV array would depend on several factors, including the angle, direction, and size of the array. Assuming an optimal angle and direction for maximum sunlight capture, a 10-kilowatt (kW) array would produce approximately 8,500 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity per year. The cost of electricity produced with this array would depend on several factors, including the cost of the solar panels, installation costs, and the cost of maintenance. If the array were installed at a cost of $2.50 per watt, the total cost of the array would be $25,000. Assuming a 25-year lifespan for the array, this translates to a cost of $1 per watt per year. Therefore, the cost of electricity produced by the array would be around $0.14 per kWh.
Now, we will compare this output and cost to an identical array in Benin, Nigeria. The climate in Benin is much more tropical, with an average of 2,400 hours of sunshine per year and annual precipitation ranging from about 900-1300 mm. These conditions are much more favorable for solar energy production. Using polycrystalline solar cells, a 10 kW array in Benin would produce approximately 12,000 kWh of electricity per year, which is around 40% more than the output of the array in Reading. Assuming the same installation and maintenance costs, the cost of electricity produced by the array in Benin would be around $0.08 per kWh, which is approximately 40% less than the cost of electricity produced by the array in Reading. This comparison shows how a project’s success can depend on various climatic factors.
Lastly, we will assess the potential profit and funding available for the project. In the UK, there are several government and financial incentives available for renewable energy projects. The most significant incentive is the Feed-in Tariff (FIT), which pays a fixed rate for every kWh of electricity generated by the array, whether it is used by the building or exported back to the grid. Assuming the FIT rate is $0.20 per kWh, the array in Reading would generate around $1,700 per year in revenue. Therefore, with installation costs of $25,000, the array could potentially break even in around 15 years and begin generating a profit after that.
In Nigeria, the regulatory environment is not as developed as in the UK, and there is less government support for renewable energy projects. However, the country’s significant potential for solar energy production has attracted international investors willing to fund projects. A project of this scale in Nigeria would likely require international funding, which would need to be secured before the project could move forward.
In conclusion, the most efficient and cost-effective solar cell type to use for a proposed PV array on a sloping roof near Reading, UK, is polycrystalline solar cells. The annual yield and cost of electricity produced vary with different cell types, and polycrystalline solar cells provide a good balance between efficiency and cost-effectiveness in this climate. The output of the project in Reading is lower than in Benin, Nigeria, due to the difference in climatic conditions. The potential profit and funding available for the project depend on the regulatory environment and financial incentives available, which are more favorable in the UK than in Nigeria. With careful planning, however, a PV array in either location can provide reliable and efficient electricity production for many years to come.
