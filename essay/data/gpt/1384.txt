State punishment is a contentious topic that has been debated for centuries. Punishment is often necessary in society as a way to deter criminal behavior and maintain civil order. But punishment can also be used to satisfy vengeance or revenge, which raises questions about its control and justification. There have been two prominent theories within the justification of state punishment: the utilitarian and retributivist theories.
The utilitarian theory of punishment suggests that punishment should be used to promote the greatest good for the greatest number of people. This approach emphasizes that the punishment should be proportional to the crime committed, and that the severity of the punishment should be adjusted depending on the circumstances surrounding the crime. The punishment should only be used if it deters future criminal behavior or rehabilitates criminals so that they can rejoin society as productive members.
The justification of punishment, according to utilitarians, depends on the consequences of the punishment, relating to the welfare of those affected by the punishment. Utilitarians believe that punishment can deter the offender from committing the same crime again in the future, and also create a sense of fear in others who have the will to commit such crimes.
On the other hand, the retributivist theory of punishment asserts that punishment should be given in exact proportion to the moral wrong of the crime committed. This approach is based on the belief that offenders deserve to be punished because they have committed a wrong against society and state. This approach emphasizes the need to hold the offender accountable for their actions, and to restore the moral balance of society by punishing the offender for their moral wrong.
Retributivist theories of justice emerged during the Enlightenment and was popularized in the writings of Immanuel Kant. They argue that offenders are responsible for their actions because they make a deliberate choice to act in a certain way. Therefore, the offender should be held accountable for their actions and punished accordingly.
The justification of punishment according to retributivists is not based on its consequences, as in the case of utilitarian theories, but rather on a more fundamental principle of justice. Retributivists argue that punishment is important because it acknowledges the inherent worth of the offender who hurt the victim. By being punished, the offender is being treated as a moral agent, responsible for their actions, and thus, subject to moral scrutiny.
The utilitarian approach to punishment has been criticized on several grounds. First, it is argued that it is difficult to predict the consequences of punishment, so it is not possible to know whether the punishment will have the desired effect of deterring future criminal behavior. As a result, the punishment may be excessive, cruel, or unjustified. Second, there is a concern that punishment is often used as a means of satisfying public anger, rather than as a rational response to the crime committed.
Moreover, some argue that the focus on consequentialist justification often leads to punishment being treated as a means to an end, rather than as an end in and of itself. This undermines the moral value that punishment can have for victims as well as offenders who take responsibility for their actions.
In contrast, retributivist theorists argue that punishment is necessary for moral restoration. The fundamental principle underlying retributivist theories is that justice requires punishment as an expression of the moral worth of a crime committed. Retributivists argue that punishment can be seen as a fitting response to wrongdoing, recognizing the moral value of punishing someone who has violated a moral principle.
One of the most compelling arguments for retributivist theories of punishment is that a sense of justice is essential to human society. Without a sense of justice, we risk creating societies that are characterized by moral chaos and disorder. This is because a sense of justice is essential for maintaining moral boundaries, and for encouraging people to act in moral ways.
There are various retributivist accounts of justice that have emerged. For example, some retributivists argue that justice requires that the punishment be equal to the harm caused by the crime committed. Others argue that justice only requires that the punishment be proportional to the crime committed. Still, others argue that justice demands that the punishment be severe enough to express the moral condemnation of the community.
One of the most intriguing retributivist theories of justice is the “Lex Talionis” theory, also known as the law of retaliation. This theory suggests that the punishment should be equivalent to the harm caused by the crime committed. This theory claims that the offender must suffer the same harm or injury that was inflicted upon the victim. According to the Lex Talionis, punishment must be reciprocal, and the offender must be punished in a way made by the victim before or for the same harm.
In conclusion, the utilitarian and retributivist theories of punishment are two prominent perspectives that differ significantly in their justificatory methods. Utilitarian theories emphasize the consequences of punishment, while retributivist theories focus on its moral justification. Despite the critiques of utilitarianism, it remains a popular approach to punishment because the idea of practical usefulness appeals to many people, and this approach is more measurable and quantifiable. At the same time, retributivist approaches have also gained traction because they focus on the moral principles underlying punishment. Ultimately, both approaches have merits and drawbacks, and it is up to societies based on their moral values to decide on the most appropriate approach.
