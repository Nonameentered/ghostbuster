Chimpanzees are one of the closest living relatives to humans. They share around 98 percent of their DNA with humans. Wild chimpanzees live in large groups of around 50 to 150 individuals. These groups are complex and highly social, with individuals forming close bonds with family members, friends, and allies. However, in many zoos worldwide, chimpanzees often live in small groups or pairs. There has been considerable research on the impact different grouping arrangements have on captive chimpanzee behavior, including the impact of all-female groups compared to mixed-sex groups in UK zoos.
One of the significant benefits of all-female groups is the freedom it offers females from male harassment. Female chimpanzees are often the victims of male aggression and are forced to mate when not in estrus. All-female groups remove this pressure and enable females to engage in more natural behaviors, including grooming, socializing, and rest. All-female groups have shown a decrease in aggression and an increase in social behaviors compared to mixed-sex groupings.
In contrast, mixed-sex groups can cause more conflict and aggression between males and females, particularly when a female is in estrus. One of the significant challenges for mixed-sex groups is protecting females and young from male aggression. To do so, zoos must employ management procedures such as introducing contraceptives and housing that prevents males from reaching females if the group space is too small.
UK zoos typically house chimpanzees in mixed-sex groups, although there are some all-female groups. A recent study comparing mixed-sex chimpanzee groups in UK zoos found high levels of aggression towards both male and female group members. These findings indicated that mixed-sex groups require consistent monitoring from the management team to prevent serious injuries and social disruption.
Moreover, another study comparing the two groupings in UK zoos found that all-female groups had a more relaxed and cohesive atmosphere than mixed-sex groups. The research found that all-female groups in zoos exhibited more natural chimpanzee behaviors and were more comfortable around visitors compared to mixed-sex groups, where chimpanzees were often anxious, and visitors had a more challenging time observing them in their natural state.
In conclusion, all-female groups are advantageous for chimpanzees in captivity, as they allow females to behave more naturally, reduce aggression levels, and increase social activity. Although mixed-sex groups are challenging to manage and require consistent management strategies, they can still provide chimpanzees with enriching social environments. However, the research suggests that all-female groups offer a better quality of life for chimpanzees in captivity, as they are more relaxed and exhibit a more natural social behavior. Therefore, the benefits of all-female groups should be considered when designing chimpanzee housing arrangements in zoos.
