EHL is a Switzerland-based hospitality management school that offers its engineering students a broad range of hospitality, tourism, and luxury learning courses. One of the major challenges that the institution has been grappling with is the quality of education it imparts on its students, which has been affiliated with a high rate of student failure and a losing edge. Various underlying problems contribute to quality issues in the institution. These range from curriculum inadequacy and slow adoption of technology to low-quality student-faculty interactions and poorly defined roles among human resource personnel. A Total Quality Management (TQM) approach could prove valuable in improving quality performance at EHL by addressing these underlying issues. This essay examines the underlying problems causing quality issues at EHL and explains how a TQM approach could help the institution ameliorate quality performance.
One of the primary problems causing quality issues at EHL is the curriculum inadequacy that fails to meet industry standards. The current curriculum is rigid and requires frequent updating, a challenge the institution has been struggling to meet. The curriculum inadequacy challenge is further compounding by the increasingly dynamic hospitality industry. The past few years have seen the industry experience disruptive technologies, demographic and cultural changes, as well as shifts in consumer consumption patterns. The industry's adaptation to these changes is informing its expectations from institutions such as EHL. This, combined with significant changes facing the global education landscape, is forcing educational institutions to re-evaluate their existing curricula and strive for learning systems that link theory and practice seamlessly.
The second problem contributing to quality issues at EHL is the institution's slow adoption of technology. The hospitality industry is undergoing rapid digital transformation, driving various industries to embrace technology to improve efficiency and productivity. EHL's slow adoption of technology has led to decreased quality performance, especially in the areas of student engagement, learning outcome, and faculty-student interactions. The present technology infrastructure is outdated and insufficient to meet the diverse needs of students and faculty. It is imperative that EHL accelerates its investment in technology infrastructure to provide students, staff, and faculty with up-to-date hardware and software, cloud-based storage, and a platform for remote learning and assessment.
Third, EHL is grappling with low-quality student-faculty interaction. A Hands-on learning model integrated into classwork is the school's main appeal. Although the model emphasizes student engagement and effective learning, challenges exist in ensuring that the faculty has adequate teaching resources to facilitate the hands-on approach. Additionally, the structure of the classes limits faculty-student interaction to reduce contact hours, which negatively impacts learning outcomes. The school needs to establish more meaningful channels for feedback loops between students and faculty, as well as balance the flip classroom approach to retain the schools' teachers and student engagement.
Lastly, EHL has poorly defined roles among human resource personnel. Poorly defined roles exist for every staff member in the organization, from the leadership to the junior employees. The vacuum between the various staff positions leads to low staff morale, workloads inefficiency, and poor quality performance. The situation is made more complex by the school's multi-cultural composition, which must be dealt with cultural sensitivity. EHL must restructure its organizational charts and develop meaningful role definitions to improve employee job satisfaction and establish effective workplace communication protocols.
Despite the challenges, EHL can address its quality issue by implementing Total Quality Management (TQM) principles. TQM is a management approach characterized by continuous improvement, customer satisfaction, and a process-oriented system that drives quality management. The implementation of TQM should commence with assessing the existing processes, identifying any shortcomings, and developing improvement plans that align with the institution's mission, vision, and strategic objectives.
Through TQM, EHL can address curriculum inadequacy by conducting regular surveys to identify areas that require improvement in the curriculum. Based on the survey, EHL can adapt its programs and teaching methods to ensure that they meet industry standards and satisfy the needs of both students and the labor market. The school ought to establish advisory committees that bring together academics, industry leaders, and alumni who can share information and knowledge to influence teaching, research, and learning strategies.
Accelerating technology adoption is another area where TQM can transform EHL's quality performance. The school can leverage digital technologies to collect and analyze data to gain insights into faculty and student performance. It can develop additional digital learning resources, such as gamified solutions to encourage meaningful learning and knowledge retention. TQM approach can also provide an avenue for establishing eportfolios for student work, online feedback systems and relevant training to improve teaching methods and boost student interaction with faculty.
TQM can also significantly improve student-faculty interactions at EHL. Faculty should train on the advantages of the flipped classroom approach and teaching methods that lead to high quality interactions. EHL may also consider mentoring programs and teacher support systems that facilitate faculty and student interactions channels that encourage continued learning and build positive relationships.
Finally, through TQM, EHL may consider restructuring and clarifying roles among human resource personnel. Confusion among employees regarding job descriptions, authority levels, and decision-making limits can be solved through effective communication, integration, and orientation programs. Effective communication and cultural sensitivity training should occur at all levels, ensuring a better working relationship for employees with diverse backgrounds and promoting open communication practices.
In conclusion, improving quality performance at EHL involves addressing several underlying challenges, including in-depth curriculum inadequacy, slow adaptation of technology, low-quality student and teacher interactions, and poorly defined roles among human resource personnel. Through the implementation of a TQM approach, EHL can address these challenges by re-evaluating its curricula, accelerating its technology adoption, training faculty and students through flipped classroom models, and redefining roles that foster positive human resource rapport and effective communication. By doing so, the institution can rejuvenate its reputation and reputation in the hospitality, tourism, and luxury learning courses sector.
