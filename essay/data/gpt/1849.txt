Introduction:
Aristotle, a great philosopher of ancient Greece, defines eudaimonia as the ultimate goal of human life, which can be defined as living a good life or flourishing. This idea of eudaimonia has been the subject of extensive debate and discussion among philosophers over the centuries. Moreover, Aristotle himself introduced two distinct accounts of eudaimonia, the ethical and intellectual accounts. This essay aims to explore how these accounts can be reconciled and how they complement each other to achieve the ultimate goal of human life.
Ethical Account of Eudaimonia:
The ethical account of eudaimonia is based on Aristotle's belief that a virtuous life is necessary for achieving eudaimonia. He argues that eudaimonia can only be achieved by developing moral virtues such as courage, generosity, and justice. According to Aristotle, these virtues are not innate but are developed through practice and habituation. Therefore, individuals must practice these virtues to make them a part of their character.
Additionally, Aristotle argues that eudaimonia is not a momentary state but a continuous process of living a virtuous life. He believes that individuals must strive to live a virtuous life consistently, and it is only then that they can achieve true eudaimonia.
Intellectual Account of Eudaimonia:
The intellectual account of eudaimonia is based on Aristotle's belief that humans are rational beings and that the development of intellectual virtues is necessary for achieving eudaimonia. Aristotle argues that individuals must develop intellectual virtues such as wisdom, understanding, and knowledge to achieve true eudaimonia. He believes that these virtues are not innate but can be cultivated through learning and education.
Moreover, Aristotle argues that the pursuit of knowledge is also essential for achieving eudaimonia. He believes that individuals must strive to understand the world around them and seek knowledge for its own sake. By doing so, individuals can achieve a deeper understanding of themselves and the world, leading to greater happiness and fulfillment.
Reconciling the Two Accounts:
Aristotle's two accounts of eudaimonia seem distinct, but they are interrelated and complementary to each other. The ethical account of eudaimonia emphasizes the importance of moral virtues, whereas the intellectual account emphasizes the importance of intellectual virtues. Yet, both accounts seek to achieve the same goal of human life, which is to lead a good life.
The ethical account emphasizes the importance of developing moral virtues that enable individuals to act ethically and to contribute positively to society. The intellectual account, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of developing intellectual virtues that enable individuals to understand the world better and to make informed decisions.
These two accounts can be reconciled by recognizing that they are not mutually exclusive but rather, they support and complement each other. The moral virtues developed through the ethical account are necessary for living a virtuous life, where individuals can contribute to society while fostering a sense of purpose and personal fulfillment. Similarly, the intellectual virtues developed through the intellectual account are necessary for gaining a deeper understanding of the world around us and making informed decisions.
Moreover, Aristotle argues that these two accounts are not exclusive but are necessary for achieving eudaimonia. He emphasizes that the development of moral and intellectual virtues must go hand in hand. Aristotle believes that individuals must cultivate both types of virtues and that a balance between the two is necessary for achieving true eudaimonia.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, Aristotle's two accounts of eudaimonia provide an essential foundation for living a good life. The ethical account emphasizes the importance of moral virtues, whereas the intellectual account emphasizes the importance of intellectual virtues. However, these two accounts are not mutually exclusive but are complementary to each other. The development of moral and intellectual virtues is necessary for achieving eudaimonia. Therefore, individuals must strive to develop both types of virtues, and a balance between the two is necessary for living a good life. Aristotle's philosophy is still relevant today, and his ideas on eudaimonia can inspire us to live a more ethical and fulfilling life.
