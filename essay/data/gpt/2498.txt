Cheese is considered one of the oldest and most popular dairy products in the world. It is a rich source of nutrients, such as calcium and protein, and has been consumed by individuals globally for centuries. There are different types of cheeses, including soft cheese, which is characterized by its creamy texture, mild flavor, and high moisture content. The process of manufacturing cheese is a complex one that involves several steps. This essay explores the basic steps involved in cheese manufacturing specifically for soft cheese, how coagulation occurs in the process, how syneresis of the curd affects the final product of the cheese, the factors that influence syneresis, and how milk composition changes during the cheese making process.
The basic steps in cheese manufacturing for soft cheese involve the following processes: coagulation, separation, molding, salting, and ripening. Firstly, coagulation occurs when milk is mixed with a starter culture, which is a blend of lactic acid bacteria, and a coagulating enzyme, rennet. This process causes the milk to thicken, resulting in the formation of curds and whey. The curds are solid, while the whey is liquid. The separation process comes next, where the curds are scooped from the whey, using a ladle or a cheesecloth. 
The curds are then molded into the desired shapes using molds, and the salt is added to the cheese after molding. Salting helps to preserve the cheese, and it also affects the texture and flavor of the cheese. Finally, the cheese is ripened, which refers to the process of maturing the cheese. During this process, the cheese develops its unique flavor, texture, and aroma. The length of ripening time varies depending on the type of cheese, with some taking weeks while others take months.
Coagulation is the process that occurs when the milk is combined with the starter culture and the coagulating enzyme. There are two types of coagulation: enzymatic and acid. In enzymatic coagulation, the milk is mixed with rennet, which is derived from the stomach of a calf. Rennet contains chymosin, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of casein into a gel-like substance, thereby initiating coagulation. 
Acid coagulation occurs when a starter culture is added to the milk, which produces lactic acid. The lactic acid reduces the pH of the milk, resulting in the coagulation of casein. The type of coagulation used depends on the type of cheese being made, with softer cheeses like ricotta and cream cheese usually requiring acid coagulation, while harder cheeses like cheddar and gouda require enzymatic coagulation.
Syneresis of the curd affects the final product of the cheese in several ways. Syneresis refers to the process whereby liquid is expelled from the curds, leading to a reduction in their volume. The main factor that influences syneresis is the acidity of the cheese. For instance, if the cheese has high acidity, it will have a low syneresis rate, as the acid lowers the pH of the cheese, causing it to become more cohesive.
On the other hand, low-acid cheese like cottage cheese has a high syneresis rate because of its high water content, which causes the curds to shrink and release liquid. The rate of syneresis affects the texture and taste of the cheese. For instance, a high syneresis rate results in a dense and crumbly cheese, while a low syneresis rate produces a creamy and smooth cheese.
Milk composition changes during the cheese making process. One of the significant changes that occur is the modification of lactose, the sugar found in milk. During cheese manufacturing, the lactose in milk is converted into lactic acid by the starter culture, leading to a reduction in the pH of the milk. This reduction in pH causes the casein in the milk to coagulate, resulting in the separation of the curd and whey. 
Another change that occurs is the breakdown of protein in the milk, which is influenced by enzymes and bacteria added during the cheese making process. The breakdown of protein results in the production of amino acids, which contribute to the flavor and texture of the cheese. The fat content of the milk is also a crucial factor in cheese manufacturing. The higher the fat content in the milk, the creamier and milder the cheese, while low-fat milk results in a less creamy and milder cheese.
In conclusion, cheese manufacturing is a complex process that involves several steps, including coagulation, separation, molding, salting, and ripening. The type of coagulation used depends on the type of cheese being made, while syneresis of the curd affects the texture and taste of the cheese. Milk composition changes during the cheese making process, with significant modifications in lactose, protein, and fat content. Understanding the cheese manufacturing process is crucial in producing high-quality cheese, ensuring that every aspect of the process is done correctly to achieve the desired texture, flavor, and aroma.
