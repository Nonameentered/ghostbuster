Aphra Behn, an English playwright and author, explored various themes such as love, gender, and power in her works. In her poem "The Willing Mistress," Behn uses the literary devices of rhyme, meter, and metaphorical language to effectively convey the themes of indecision and longing. The poem follows the speaker as she struggles to make a decision about whether or not to give into her desires for a man. Through the use of poetic techniques, Behn is able to convey the complexity of the speaker's emotions and the depth of her longing.
One of the most prominent literary devices used in "The Willing Mistress" is rhyme. Behn uses end rhyme throughout the poem, which helps to create a sense of musicality and flow. The rhyme scheme is iambic tetrameter AABB, which means that each line consists of four iambs (an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable), and the last word of each pair of lines rhymes. The consistent use of rhyme creates a sense of stability, which contrasts with the speaker's indecision and confusion. The speaker is unable to make a decision about whether or not to give in to her desires, and the rhyme scheme emphasizes the repetitive nature of her dilemma.
Behn also uses metaphorical language to convey the speaker's longing. In the poem, the speaker compares herself to a prisoner who is held captive by her own desires. She describes her heart as a "rebellious thing" that refuses to conform to societal norms. This metaphor helps to emphasize the speaker's sense of longing and deep desire for the man she is speaking to. She is unable to control her own emotions and ultimately succumbs to her desires. The metaphor helps to convey the intensity of the speaker's feelings and emphasizes the overwhelming nature of her internal struggle.
Finally, meter is also used to convey the speaker's feelings and emotions. The iambic tetrameter rhythm creates a sense of stability and balance in the poem. However, Behn also uses variations in meter to highlight the speaker's emotional state. For example, in the second stanza, the line "And I must be confined" uses an extra syllable at the end of the line, which disrupts the regular iambic tetrameter meter. This variation emphasizes the speaker's sense of restriction and confinement, which contrast with her desire for freedom and expression.
Overall, the use of literary devices in "The Willing Mistress" is incredibly effective in conveying the themes of indecision and longing. Behn's use of rhyme creates a sense of musicality and stability, which contrasts with the speaker's internal struggles. The metaphorical language helps to emphasize the intensity of the speaker's desires and her inability to control her own emotions. Finally, shifts in meter and rhythm help to highlight the speaker's emotional states, emphasizing the complexity of her feelings.
In conclusion, "The Willing Mistress" is an incredibly powerful poem that explores complex themes of love, desire, and indecision. Aphra Behn's use of literary devices such as rhyme, metaphor, and meter expertly conveys the speaker's internal struggles and deep-seated desires. The result is a beautiful and moving piece of poetry that highlights the power of language to capture and express complex emotions. Behn's work remains a timeless reminder of the enduring power of poetry to speak to the deepest aspects of the human experience.
