Pneumatic systems are advantageous because they are reliable, easy to maintain, and have a long lifespan. They are also cost-effective and safe to use in hazardous environments. However, disadvantages include limited precision and control, high noise levels, and inefficiency compared to electrical actuators. Pneumatic circuits link with real-life applications such as automated assembly lines, packaging equipment, and robotics. The quality of air supplied to the system is important to prevent contamination and damage to pneumatic components. For example, during a laboratory experiment, we observed that introducing oil into the system caused malfunctioning valves and cylinders. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the air supply is properly filtered and lubricated.
