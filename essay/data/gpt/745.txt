Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull is a masterpiece of American cinema, a deeply personal film that depicts the life of the troubled boxer Jake LaMotta. The opening shot of the movie is a wide-angle view of a sweaty, overweight LaMotta practicing his comedy routine in front of a smoky, dimly lit backdrop. This shot is significant not only for its visual power but also for its symbolic import. In this essay, I will describe the significance of the opening shot of Raging Bull and how it sets up the portrayal of the main protagonist, Jake LaMotta.
The opening shot of the movie is a slow, deliberate pan across a smoky, underground nightclub in New York City. The camera lingers on the audience: a few disinterested patrons at tables, a couple of seedy-looking performers waiting their turn, and a group of tawdry-looking women in the front row. Then, in the center of the stage, the camera stops on a wide shot of LaMotta in profile, trying out some of his material. This shot establishes several key elements of Raging Bull's narrative and visual style.
Firstly, it establishes the seedy, desperate atmosphere of the world in which LaMotta lives. The smoky, claustrophobic nightclub, with its dim lighting and scattered audience, feels like a place where dreams go to die. The patrons are uninterested in the performers, and the performers themselves are weary and jaded. This sets the tone for the rest of the movie, which is full of scenes set in similar environments. It's a world where there are no easy victories, and where even the most talented and powerful can fall victim to their own weaknesses.
Secondly, the opening shot allows the audience to see the body of LaMotta before they see his face. This is a deliberate choice on the part of Scorsese and cinematographer Michael Chapman, who use the shot to introduce the audience to LaMotta's physicality before anything else. In this shot, LaMotta is overweight, sweaty, and clearly past his prime. His physicality is a crucial part of the character's story, as it reflects his descent from a powerful, unbeatable fighter to a bitter, washed-up has-been. The opening shot establishes the idea that LaMotta's physicality is integral to his character, and that his decline is directly connected to his loss of physical power.
Thirdly, the opening shot sets up the idea that LaMotta is seeking a certain kind of validation from the audience. His comedy routine is not particularly funny, and the audience is largely indifferent to him. Nevertheless, he persists, trying out different jokes, hoping for some sign of approval. This sets up a key theme of the movie: the idea that LaMotta's desires for approval and validation will lead him down a dark path. He may be a talented fighter, but he is also deeply insecure and constantly seeking something he will never find.
Finally, the opening shot introduces the idea of performance, a theme that runs throughout Raging Bull. LaMotta is, in many ways, always performing, whether in the ring or on the stage. He is always seeking to entertain, to impress, to win. The opening shot establishes the idea that LaMotta's whole life is a performance, and that his public image is perhaps more important to him than anything else.
As the opening shot comes to a close, the camera moves in closer to LaMotta, and we hear him begin to tell a joke. It's a crude, vulgar joke, not particularly funny, and the audience ignores it. LaMotta, undeterred, keeps going, trying out different jokes, hoping for some sign of approval. This moment is crucial, as it establishes the character's desire for validation and his willingness to degrade himself in pursuit of it. It also gives the audience a glimpse into LaMotta's aggressive, macho personality and sets up the idea that he will do whatever it takes to prove himself to others.
In the subsequent scenes, we see LaMotta training, fighting, and living his life. As the movie progresses, we see the character become more and more consumed by his own demons. Ultimately, he destroys his own career and personal life, ruining relationships and alienating those closest to him. The opening shot of the movie is incredibly significant in this sense, as it sets up the idea that LaMotta is a character consumed by his own inner demons, constantly seeking validation and acceptance from a world that will never fully give it to him.
In conclusion, the opening shot of Raging Bull is one of the most powerful and significant shots in American cinema. It establishes the seedy, desperate world in which LaMotta lives, introduces the character's physicality and desire for validation, and sets up the idea that performance is a key theme of the movie. Above all, the opening shot sets up the character of Jake LaMotta, portraying him as a deeply flawed and troubled protagonist, consumed by his own inner demons and searching for something he will never find. It is a brilliant opening shot, one that sets in motion a narrative that is both harrowing and unforgettable.
