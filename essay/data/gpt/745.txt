The Victorian Age was a period of tremendous social, political, and economic change in England. The rise of industrialism brought about a new era of wealth and prosperity, but it also led to widespread poverty and social inequality. Many writers during this time, such as Charles Dickens, used their works to comment on these changes and to explore the complexities of society and human nature.
One of the key ways in which industrialism influenced literature during the Victorian Age was through the rise of the novel as a literary form. With the spread of literacy and the growth of the middle class, novels became increasingly popular and were seen as a way of exploring the social and moral issues of the day. Many of these novels focused on the impact of industrialization on society, and on the lives of the working-class people who had been most affected by it.
Charles Dickens was one of the most famous writers of this period, and his novels are perhaps the most significant examples of the way in which authors used their works to comment on the social and political changes of the time. Dickens was born into a middle-class family, but his experiences working as a child labourer in a factory and as a journalist in London gave him a profound understanding of the social and economic hardships faced by the poor.
In his novels, such as Oliver Twist, Hard Times, and Bleak House, Dickens used vivid characters and situations to expose the inequalities and injustices of Victorian society. He highlighted the struggles of the working-class people, the corruption of the political and legal systems, and the cruelty that was inflicted on children and vulnerable members of society. His works were immensely popular with the reading public, and helped to draw attention to the urgent need for social reform.
But it was not only the subject matter of Dickens’ novels that made them so influential. He was also a master of language and style, and used these tools to great effect to convey his messages. His descriptions of the gritty streets of London, with their smog and filth, were so vivid that readers could almost smell the grime. He created memorable characters, such as the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol, who embodied the worst instincts of human nature, and whose redemption served as a powerful lesson on the importance of compassion and kindness.
Another way in which industrialism influenced literature during the Victorian Age was through the rise of realist writing. Realism was a literary movement that focused on the harsh realities of life, and rejected the romanticism and idealism of earlier literary forms. Realist writers sought to depict life as it really was, and to expose the flaws and contradictions of society.
One of the most prominent realist writers of the Victorian Age was George Eliot. Eliot’s novels, such as Middlemarch and Silas Marner, were known for their attention to detail and their nuanced characterizations. She was particularly interested in exploring the complexities of social relationships, and in showing how individuals were shaped by the social and economic systems of their time.
In her novel, Adam Bede, for example, Eliot depicted the struggles of a young woman called Hetty who becomes pregnant out of wedlock and faces social ostracism as a result. Through Hetty’s story, Eliot revealed the rigid morality of Victorian society, and the way in which women were often punished for transgressing social norms.
Like Dickens, Eliot also used her writing to explore the complexities of human nature. In Middlemarch, she created a diverse cast of characters, each with their own flaws, desires, and motivations. By showing the interplay of these characters, she revealed the contradictions and tensions that lay at the heart of Victorian society.
In conclusion, it is clear that industrialism and the Victorian Age had a profound influence on literature, particularly the novel. Writers such as Dickens and Eliot used their works to comment on the social and political changes of the time, and to explore the complexities of human nature. Through language and style, they conveyed powerful messages about the importance of social justice, compassion, and understanding. Their works remain influential to this day, and continue to inspire readers and writers alike to examine the complexities of the world we live in.
