The United States of the 19th century experienced tremendous growth in its transport sector, which had an immense impact on American culture. The rise of railroads in the 19th century changed the way people moved and experienced America. Railways connected Eastern and Western coasts and helped popularize places like Atlantic City.
Atlantic City is on the eastern coast of the United States, located on Absecon Island, New Jersey. Historically, Atlantic City had been a quiet seaside resort, known for health clinics and spas that offered the healing properties of saltwater. At the start of the 19th century, the city had a population of about 1000 residents. Before the development of the railroad in the United States, the journey from Philadelphia to Atlantic City included travel by horse-drawn carriage, while those coming from New York had to take the ferry to get to Atlantic City. The journey was inconvenient and took a long time, causing people to seek alternative locations. However, the advent of the railroad completely changed the situation and turned Atlantic City into a popular tourist destination.
The arrival of the first steam-powered train in 1854 marked a turning point in the history of Atlantic City. The Camden and Atlantic railway line was the first to reach the city, traveling from the mainland and ending on the banks of Absecon Creek. The railway provided a much faster and more convenient means of transportation between Philadelphia and Atlantic City, and it made it possible for people to take day trips to Atlantic City. The one-hour train ride from Philadelphia became a popular day trip for people seeking the sun and sea.

The train facilitated rapid growth and ensured that the city was accessible to anyone traveling from the north or south.

As the popularity of Atlantic City grew, the operators of the railway line continued to improve facilities, which made traveling more enjoyable. The railway companies constructed specific stations for high-end accommodations such as the famous Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel. The hotels constructed provided a different entertainment avenue by housing casinos and nightclubs for people to enjoy after the daytime beach activities.

The train also allowed people to lose themselves in thought, enjoy quiet contemplations, and think about the journey.
