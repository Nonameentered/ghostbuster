Technology has been the driving force of modernization and change in various facets of human life. It enables us to undertake tasks more efficiently, faster and significantly cheaper than traditional techniques. Many developed nations have been quick to adopt technology-based solutions to help regulate and enhance public services such as health care, transportation, education, and emergency services by integrating advanced systems in their operations. However, the process of implementing technology-based solutions is not always smooth. Its implementation in mandatory public services such as emergency medical services often encounters significant challenges. One of the most notable cases is the automation of the London ambulance dispatch system that led to various issues. This essay will explore the issues with the automation of the London ambulance dispatch system and what could have been done differently to prevent these issues.
The London ambulance dispatch system handles over a million calls every year, making it a crucial part of the capital city's emergency medical response. Before the transition to an automated system, the ambulance dispatch system relied on manual operations, which proved inadequate to meet the increasing demand for ambulance services. The implementation of the automated system was supposed to solve this problem by providing a faster and more efficient service to the public. However, the system encountered several issues, the first of which was the loss of information during the call handling process.
An automated system relies on technology to process and dispatch requests for service. This process involves a series of standardized algorithms that aim to identify the appropriate service required to address the emergency. However, sometimes algorithms are not perfect, and they do not cover every possible emergency situation. Therefore, when a call comes through with information that does not fit the algorithms, there are no defined protocols for handling the call, and sometimes the conversations become disjointed. This issue resulted in the loss of critical information during the call handling process. In numerous instances, ambulance crews were dispatched to incidents involving alcohol-related trauma, which was not initially identified, and therefore, crew members were not adequately prepared for this type of emergency.
Despite the shortcomings of the automation system, it cannot be blamed entirely. One aspect of the problem is that the dispatch operators' skills were not well matched with the new technology, which led to poor communication and inability to efficiently transfer essential information. This could have been addressed by first providing sufficient training and development programs to dispatchers before the new system was implemented.
Another major issue with the automated system was its lack of flexibility. The automation system used fixed geographical areas of responsibility for each ambulance unit in London, catering for the pre-determined Hospital Emergency Departments. The new system assumed that areas with higher demands required a higher number of ambulances in the area, which in turn, would reduce response times. Unfortunately, the system was not flexible in accommodating changes when there was an increased demand for ambulances from one particular area. This situation often led to extended waiting times before an ambulance arrived at the destination. This issue could have been resolved by incorporating an analytical model that would enable the system to interpret and respond to new patterns of demand, and alternatively, using a Dynamic deployment model that would have allowed managers to direct ambulances to regions experiencing increased demand.
The other notable issue was the complexity of the automated system. Ambulance dispatch involves many complex factors that are not always predictable. For instance, identifying the cause of non-responsive patients typically involves a sequence of questions and prioritizing interventions. In this case, the implementation of an automated system oversimplified the problem that could have been resolved instead through human touch.
Furthermore, the system's complexity led to increased response times, which is a major issue in emergency medical situations. For instance, advanced life support calls that were meant to be attended to by specialized crews often took longer due to performance issues that were encountered by the entire system. The increased complexity came with a significant cost of procurement, software, and hardware modifications, which included customized dispatch algorithms, explicit interface requirements, and functional features that all contributed to the enormous investment that was required for the project.
Another significant issue was the pressure put on the emergency staff, who were required to handle the high call volume with minimal break times. This led to stress and fatigue among the dispatch staff, leading to errors and burnout. Moreover, the system could not efficiently accommodate the immense traffic volumes that resulted from natural calamities or other disasters. By using an automated system, the authorities relied on technological skills, implying that communication processes were built around the IT systems. This resulted in several broken links in the communication system, resulting in significant problems in situations where the system was needed the most.
To prevent these issues, several steps could have been taken before the implementation of the automated system. One possible approach could have been to conduct a thorough evaluation of the existing system, a survey of the users (ambulance staff), and an analysis of the volumes of data that are involved in the ambulance dispatch process. This would have also required a more thorough definition of the system's underlying purpose to ensure it was designed to meet users' needs.
The London Ambulance Authority also should have involved the users, the so-called “big users” in the development stages, who would have collaborated with the development team to create a more user-friendly and effective system. This approach would bring the big users, who have practical experience, in collaboration with the technology professionals, enabling them to identify areas where technology can be used to improve service delivery and to precisely design and model the system.
There should also be an investment in staff training, with the focus being on the training of the dispatchers to cope with the new technology. This training should be designed to help them understand the system's strengths and limitations, its various functions, and the main principles of dispatching procedures.
In conclusion, the automation of the London ambulance dispatch system was an attempt to ease the burden on the manual system, which was struggling to keep up with demand. However, the new system encountered several challenges due to a lack of flexibility, complexity, and issues with call handling that could not be quickly resolved. To prevent these issues, a thorough evaluation and a collaborative approach between the big users and technology professionals should have been undertaken. Investment in staff training and development programs would have also been a massive benefit to the project. The London ambulance dispatch system was a learning curve for many, and much can be learnt from this experience when automating crucial public services to ensure that future systems are more effective, efficiently implemented, and human-centered.
