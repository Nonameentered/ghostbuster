Food packaging has undergone significant transformations over the years to meet the growing demand for longer shelf-life while preserving the quality and safety of food products. Among the technological breakthroughs in packaging, modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) has become increasingly popular in preserving meat color and quality, ranging from fresh meat to processed meat products. MAP caters to the need for prolonged shelf-life without the use of preservatives and additives through the use of high-oxygen and high-carbon dioxide levels to extend the storage life of meat products. However, several factors must be accounted for, including the preservation of meat color, lipid oxidation, and metmyoglobin formation, which can be addressed through the incorporation of antioxidants like vitamin E.
Meat color is an essential characteristic that consumers use to judge freshness, quality, and safety in meat products. This aspect of meat is mainly dependent on the pigment content and structure of myoglobin and hemoglobin, which is influenced by the environment and the process of packaging. Oxygen is a crucial factor in determining the meat color, where gradually decreasing levels of oxygen during storage lead to the development of brown meat and loss of quality. Packaging products utilizing high-oxygen levels prevent meat color deterioration, making the meat appear fresher for longer periods. High-oxygen sealing in MAP inhibits the growth of anaerobic bacteria, which thrive in low-oxygen conditions, leading to spoilage and meat discoloration.
On the other hand, high-carbon dioxide levels in MAP prevent microbial growth by creating a hostile environment, inhibiting the activities of spoilage bacteria. However, high carbon dioxide levels can lead to metmyoglobin formation, a process identified by the conversion of myoglobin to metmyoglobin, causing meat discoloration, a sign of meat spoilage. Metmyoglobin formation is linked to the oxidation of iron in heme pigments, leading to the production of reactive oxygen species that impairs protein structure, texture, and overall meat quality.
Furthermore, lipid oxidation is an essential factor in meat products, leading to rancid smells and off-flavors, which render the meat unsuitable for human consumption. Upon exposure to oxygen, lipids in meat products undergo slow but progressive oxidative changes that eventually lead to their breakdown. Lipid oxidation is the primary cause of the rancidity that occurs in meat products after extended periods of storage, leading to a loss of quality and nutritional value. High-oxygen levels in MAP packaging can escalate lipid oxidation, leading to rancid smells and flavors, which can render the meat undesirable for human consumption.
The incorporation of antioxidants in meat products is crucial in preventing the oxidative breakdown of lipids, preserving the quality and safety of meat products for human consumption. Among the common antioxidants used in meat products, vitamin E has proven to be significantly effective in preventing lipid oxidation. Vitamin E contains antioxidant properties that can neutralize free radicals and inhibit lipid oxidation, leading to prolonged shelf-life, enhanced quality, and safety of meat products. Therefore, producers may incorporate antioxidants, including vitamin E, into MAP packaging to prevent lipid oxidation and preserve meat products' quality and safety. The use of antioxidants can prevent and reduce the breakdown of lipids, preserving flavor, juiciness, and overall meat quality for longer periods of storage.
In conclusion, MAP packaging, specifically containing high-oxygen or high-carbon dioxide levels, plays an essential role in the preservation of meat color and extension of storage life for meat products. While high-oxygen levels prevent meat color deterioration, high carbon dioxide levels prevent microbial growth, leading to metmyoglobin formation. In contrast, both high-oxygen and high carbon dioxide levels contribute to the oxidative breakdown of lipids, leading to rancid odors and off-flavors. This can be mitigated by the inclusion of antioxidants like vitamin E, which inhibit lipid oxidation and maintain the quality and safety of meat products. By understanding the role of packaging and the impact on meat quality, producers can formulate packaging solutions incorporating high oxygen and carbon dioxide levels with antioxidants like vitamin E to enhance meat quality, shelf life, and preserve flavor and odor.
