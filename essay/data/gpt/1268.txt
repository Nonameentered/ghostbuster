The natural frequencies of a restrained plate can be calculated using various methods such as the finite element method, modal analysis, and analytical solutions. The finite element method involves dividing the plate into smaller elements and determining the natural frequencies of each element individually. Modal analysis involves performing experimental tests on the plate to determine its natural frequencies. Analytical solutions involve using mathematical equations to calculate the natural frequencies of the plate. The matrix density, also known as the mass distribution of the plate, affects the natural frequencies of the plate. A higher matrix density results in a higher natural frequency while a lower density results in a lower natural frequency as the mass influences the plateâ€™s stiffness.
