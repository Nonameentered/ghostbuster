Multinational corporations (MNCs) are business entities that operate in multiple countries, have a global presence, and generate massive revenues. These companies set up operations overseas to gain a competitive advantage and tap into new markets. MNCs seek to leverage their strengths and resources to maximize profits, expand their customer base, and minimize costs. There are many motivations behind MNCs setting up operations overseas, including resource seeking, market seeking, and strategic advantages. This essay explores these motivations and their role in MNCs' decision-making process, using examples to illustrate the points.
Resource Seeking
Resource seeking is one of the primary motivations behind MNCs setting up operations overseas. It involves seeking access to natural resources such as minerals, oil, and gas that are not available in their home country. MNCs invest heavily in countries with abundant natural resources to secure access to these resources, which are essential for their manufacturing operations. For instance, the oil and gas industry is one of the most critical sectors that depend on resource-seeking motivations. Companies such as Royal Dutch Shell, ExxonMobil, and Chevron have invested heavily in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East to access oil and natural gas reserves that are not available in their home countries.
Another example of resource-seeking motivation is the mining industry. Large MNCs like Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton, and Vale invest heavily in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to access mineral deposits and precious metals such as copper, gold, and iron ore. These companies set up mines and processing plants overseas to extract minerals and send them back to their home countries for refinement and processing. By investing in overseas operations, MNCs lower their production costs, increase their operational efficiency, and secure access to essential resources.
Market Seeking
Market Seeking is another key motivation behind MNCs setting up operations overseas. Market seeking involves investing in countries with robust consumer markets to sell products or services. MNCs invest in overseas operations to gain access to new customers, increase their market share, and generate additional revenues. This motivation is common in industries such as consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals, and food and beverages, where the potential for growth is significant.
For example, multinational companies such as Sony, Samsung, and LG have expanded their operations into Asia, Africa, and Latin America to sell their electronic products to a growing middle class with rising disposable income. These companies set up manufacturing plants overseas to lower production costs and increase their profitability. Additionally, they invest heavily in marketing and advertising to create brand awareness and capture the attention of potential customers.
Similarly, Pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer, Merck, and Novartis have established substantial investments in emerging markets such as India, Brazil, and China to tap into their growing middle class. These companies set up research and development centers and production facilities overseas to develop and manufacture drugs tailored to the local market demand. By investing in overseas operations, these companies gain access to new markets, increase their revenues, and expand their reach.
Strategic Advantages
Strategic advantages are another critical motivation behind MNCs setting up operations overseas. These advantages include obtaining new technology, creating strategic alliances, and entry barriers to the competition. MNCs invest in overseas operations to gain strategic advantages that will help them compete effectively in the global market and reduce their risk exposure.
For example, in the automobile industry, multinational companies such as Toyota, Honda, and BMW have established production facilities in China, South Korea, and Thailand, respectively. These companies set up strategic alliances with local partners to gain access to new technology, talent, and government support. By investing in local production, these companies can cater to the local market, reduce production costs, and create entry barriers to the competition.
Similarly, in the telecommunications industry, multinational companies such as Vodafone, AT&T, and Verizon have established joint ventures with local partners to provide telecom services in emerging markets such as India, Brazil, and China. These companies invest heavily in research and development to create new technologies and services tailored to the local market demand. By investing in overseas operations, these companies can gain strategic advantages that will help them grow and expand their reach.
Conclusion
In conclusion, multinational corporations (MNCs) set up overseas operations to gain a competitive advantage and tap into new markets. There are many motivations behind MNCs setting up operations overseas, including resource seeking, market seeking, and strategic advantages. By investing in overseas operations, MNCs can secure access to essential resources, gain access to new customers, expand their reach, and reduce their risk exposure. With globalization, MNCs will continue to expand their operations overseas to stay competitive and grow.
