A program to handle infix and postfix equations using a stack data structure is a necessary tool for mathematical operations. The program should be able to read expressions from an edit box, separate them into operands and operators, convert infix to postfix and postfix to infix, and perform calculations. The requirements for the program include a user-friendly interface, error handling for invalid expressions, and support for basic and advanced mathematical operations. The program can function by using the stack to store operators and operands, ensuring the correct order of computation, and applying the required mathematical operations. It can also provide the option of displaying the steps involved in the calculation process.
