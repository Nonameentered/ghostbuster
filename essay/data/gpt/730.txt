Love has been a recurrent and inescapable human emotion since ancient times. From epic narratives to concise verses, poets have been incorporating their personal Musas (musings) into their works to evoke a sense of passion and contemplation. Two love poems that exemplify this are Sonnet 18 by William Shakespeare and My mistress' eyes by William Butler Yeats. Through phonemes and patterns, rhyme, stress patterns, sentence structures, and metaphor usage, these two poems convey different perspectives on love and offer a glimpse at the societal and cultural frameworks that influence them.
To begin with, Sonnet 18 and My mistress' eyes have a notable contrast in rhyme patterns. Shakespeare's poem follows an ABAB CDCD EFEF GG structure, which consists of three quadruplets and a couplet. Meanwhile, Yeats' poem has an irregular structure, which can be seen in its ABCB DEFE FGHI JKJI pattern. Although the inclusion of a repeated line in the structure creates a sense of harmony within the poem, deviations from this pattern can create a sense of uncertainty and instability. Yeats' poem is much more colloquial, in stark contrast to the iambic pentameter used in Shakespeare's Sonnet 18. While Sonnet 18 is a strict 14 lines long and follows a standard sonnet form – with a volta, or a turn, in the ninth line – My mistress' eyes lacks any such formal constraints. It does not strictly adhere to any specific metre and remains flowing and free.
Additionally, the phonemes and patterns used in the poems further highlight their differences in tone. In Sonnet 18, Shakespeare employs several soft sounds, such as "shall I compare thee to a summer's day?", that create a dreamy and imaginative tone while also conveying the speaker's admiration for his lover. The harsher phonemes found in Yeats' poem, like "heart bent" and "bitter wrong", stand in stark contrast to Shakespeare's softness and evoke a sense of sadness that reflects the speaker's unrequited love. Nonetheless, both poems include an abundance of metaphors. Sonnet 18 utilizes natural imagery with comparisons such as "thou art more lovely and more temperate," while My mistress' eyes utilizes more abstract metaphors such as, "And her dark hair was the scent of wild thyme". These comparisons help to paint a vivid image of a muse who is both stunning and unforgettable.
Another significant distinction between the two poems is their sentence structure. Shakespeare employs grandiose imagery, and the poem's structure reflects this. The verses move seamlessly, with each line flowing into the next, creating a sense of grandeur and emphasis on the ideas being expressed. The use of enjambment allows each line to read smoothly, and each clause is complete, making it easier for the reader to follow the development of the idea. In contrast, Yeats uses shorter sentences, allowing him to fit in a lot of imagery and allow the poem to read more like a narrative. The shorter sentences create a pause and allow the reader to reflect on each sentence and its meaning.
Additionally, both poems present different cultural influences that may have informed their content. Shakespeare's Sonnet 18 is a part of a more significant collection of sonnets that were published in 1609. Sonnets were first written in Italy in the 13th century and were later adapted into English, shaping the meter and rhyme scheme in English poetry for years. The structure of the sonnet was characteristically patronized by wealthy patrons, and the poem itself was a reflection of intellectual and societal power. Yeats, on the other hand, was writing at the turn of the 20th century, during the era of the Irish Literary Renaissance. His poetry was influenced by the struggle to create a new Irish cultural identity, free from the constraints of English colonialism. Yeats also incorporated elements of Irish mythology into his poetry, which is evident in My mistress' eyes when he refers to his "dark Rosaleen."
The tone of the poems is also reflective of the different cultural contexts that the poets inhabited. Shakespeare's Sonnet 18 portrays the speaker's admiration for his lover with a sense of certainty and grandeur. It is almost as if the speaker is in awe of the beauty of his subject, and in some ways, it could be seen as an ode to the power of true love. On the other hand, Yeats' My mistress' eyes reflects the conflict of the lover who feels an unrequited love, as he contemplates his desires and the possibility of his muse never reciprocating his passion.
Overall, Sonnet 18 and My mistress' eyes being two love poems show different aspects of love when comparing their linguistic, poetic, and cultural features. The rhyme, stress patterns, sentence structures, and metaphor usage provide a reliable basis for comparison between Shakespeare's and Yeats' poems. The phonemes and patterns highlight the contrast in tone and approach towards love. The poems reflect the societal and cultural contexts of the poets, with Sonnet 18 being an ode to love and Yeats' My mistress' eyes reflecting the conflicting emotions of unrequited love. The use of different linguistic and poetic features in the poems also helped to enhance their impact on the reader and created vivid imagery that evokes different emotions.
