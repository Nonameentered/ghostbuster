Globalisation has been a significant phenomenon of the 21st century. It refers to the increasingly interconnectedness and integration of countries' economies, societies, and cultures globally. Although it has brought numerous benefits, such as economic growth, reduced poverty, and increased access to goods and services, globalisation has also caused significant negative impacts such as job losses, income inequality, and cultural homogenisation. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate both the costs and benefits of globalisation, and find ways to protect those who are left behind.
One of the significant benefits of globalisation is the increase in international trade. Globalisation has opened up new opportunities for countries to access new markets, which has increased their economic growth rate. Open trade policies have led to a significant increase in trade. According to the World Bank (2020), international trade as a share of GDP grew by more than 60% between 1995 and 2015. This has improved the overall living standards of people as they can now access a broader range of goods and services at lower costs.
The global market has also led to increased competition, which has incentivised innovation and technological advancements. Firms have to compete with global firms, which has led to increased efficiency, lower prices, and improved product quality. For instance, the introduction of new technologies has increased productivity, and the use of automation has reduced the need for manual labour.
However, globalisation has also led to significant costs in the form of job losses. Many jobs have been outsourced to countries with lower labour costs, such as China and India. This has affected the manufacturing sector in developed countries, which has led to job cuts and increased unemployment. For example, the loss of jobs in the United States has been a contributing factor to the economic stagnation in certain states and the increase in poverty rates (Campbell et al., 2014).
Globalisation has also led to increased income inequality. While some people have benefited from the global market, others have been left behind due to lack of skills, education, and resources. The increased competition, outsourcing, and automation have led to a widening gap between the rich and the poor. Additionally, the globalisation of finance has led to significant negative economic impacts, particularly during the 2008 financial crisis, when the developed countries' banking systems failed, leading to significant economic downturns.
While it is essential to focus on the benefits of globalisation, it is critical to address the costs and mitigate the negative impacts. One way to protect those who have been left behind is through increased investment in education and training. Education and training are essential for individuals to have the skills and knowledge necessary to compete in a globalised economy. Governments, civil societies, and businesses need to invest in education and training to ensure that individuals have access to the skills needed to remain competitive in the global job market.
Another way to address the costs of globalisation is through the use of trade adjustment assistance programs. These programs provide assistance to individuals who have lost their jobs due to globalisation. They may help them to acquire new skills and provide wage support while they are retraining or searching for new jobs. Such programs have been successful in countries such as Denmark, Germany, and Canada, where the government has been able to retrain individuals and reduce the impact of globalisation on the labour market.
Furthermore, policymakers need to address the issue of income inequality. One way to do this is through increased taxation of the wealthy and the provision of safety nets for the poor. As the globalisation process has led to increased wealth concentration, redistribution policies could help tackle poverty and inequality. For example, increasing taxes on the wealthy and using the revenue to fund social programs, such as healthcare and education, can help reduce poverty rates.
In conclusion, globalisation has brought both benefits and costs. The increase in trade has improved overall living standards, while the negative effects of increased competition, outsourcing, and automation have led to job losses, income inequality, and cultural homogenisation. To address the costs of globalisation, policymakers, businesses, and civil society must invest in education and training and introduce trade adjustment assistance programs to help those who have lost their jobs due to globalisation. They must also implement redistribution policies that cater to the poor and increase taxes on the wealthy to fund social programs such as health care, education, and welfare. Only then can the winners of globalisation protect and subsidise those who are left behind.
