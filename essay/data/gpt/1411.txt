Autism and Down's syndrome are two of the most common developmental disorders that affect children worldwide. Both of these disorders are characterized by various cognitive and behavioural deficits and are also commonly associated with different language impairments. These impairments in language are known as developmental language disorders (DLDs). This essay will explore the deficits in spoken language associated with Autism and Down's syndrome. We will discuss how these disorders differ in terms of language acquisition and use across different levels of language.
Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Symptoms of ASD usually appear early in childhood, with some children showing signs as early as six months old. The primary characteristics of ASD are impairments in social interaction and communication, as well as repetitive behaviour patterns. According to recent studies, children with ASD tend to experience significant deficits in language acquisition compared to typically developing children. Though the severity of this language impairment can vary from mild to severe, most children with ASD experience semantic and pragmatic difficulties.
One of the significant deficits in spoken language that is associated with Autism is a lack of social communication. Children with ASD may struggle to initiate and maintain social interactions with others, especially in-group settings. Additionally, children with ASD tend to have difficulty with the non-verbal aspects of communication, such as facial expressions, gestures, and tone of voice. They also have difficulty using eye contact when communicating.
Children with ASD may also encounter problems related to syntax and grammar. It is believed that some of the challenges experienced here are because of the pragmatics of linguistic communication. For instance, children with ASD may struggle to understand irony, sarcasm, and other forms of figurative language. They may also have difficulty following complex grammatical rules, which may affect their written language as well.
On the other hand, Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder that is caused by an extra copy of the 21st chromosome. It is characterized by cognitive and motor impairments, and individuals with this condition may also experience various language impairments. Compared to ASD, language acquisition in children with Down's syndrome is much better. However, their receptive language abilities often outperform their expressive language abilities.
Children with Down's syndrome typically have difficulties with speech clarity and articulation as it often emerges that they have hypotonia, which is the decreased muscle tone. This issue causes difficulties in pronunciation and may cause some words to be slurred or omitted. These difficulties may affect their intelligibility and make it challenging for others to understand them. As a result, these children may rely on gestures or non-verbal communication strategies to communicate their needs.
Moreover, grammar and syntax are often challenging for children with Down's syndrome. However, unlike children with ASD, who find difficulties in these areas due to social factors, children with Down's syndrome struggle due to cognitive difficulties. Children with Down's syndrome may also experience difficulty when using complex sentence structures or following abstract language concepts.
Another area in which children with Down's syndrome may have difficulties is in their vocabulary. They may have a smaller vocabulary than typically developing children and may struggle to understand words with multiple meanings or homophones. However, compared to children with ASD, children with Down's syndrome tend to perform better in receptive language skills, such as understanding and following instructions.
In conclusion, Autism and Down's syndrome are two developmental disorders that have substantial impacts on the language acquisition and use of affected individuals. Children with ASD tend to experience deficits in social communication and have difficulty with semantic and pragmatic aspects of language such as the use of irony, sarcasm, and other forms of figurative language. Alternatively, children with Down's syndrome have difficulties with expressive vocabulary and grammar as it relates to cognitive deficits. They also often experience speech clarity issues because of hypotonia. These deficits in spoken language may impact the daily lives of affected individuals, limiting their ability to communicate effectively with others. Therefore, it is essential to identify these difficulties in early childhood and provide the necessary supports to improve the language skills of affected individuals.
