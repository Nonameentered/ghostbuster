The basic Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is a powerful tool in estimating parameters and modeling systems. However, two modifications can be made to the basic RLS algorithm to improve its performance. These modifications are incorporating an instrument variable and a moving average noise model based on Pseudo-Linear Regression. In this essay, we will discuss these modifications and compare the results they produce with the basic ARX-based model.
The instrument variable is a technique used to eliminate endogeneity in models. Endogeneity is the correlation between the error term and the independent variable. When endogeneity occurs, the OLS estimator is biased and inconsistent. The instrumental variable technique is used to address this problem. It involves using a variable that is correlated with the independent variable but uncorrelated with the error term as an instrument to eliminate the endogeneity.
Incorporating an instrument variable in the RLS algorithm involves adding an extra term to the update equation of the RLS algorithm. The additional term is the difference between the current observation and the predicted observation. This term is multiplied by the instrument variable before being subtracted from the predicted output.
The results obtained from incorporating an instrument variable in the RLS algorithm are compared with those of the basic ARX-based model. The basic ARX-based model is a model that uses a set of input and output variables to estimate the model parameters. The model parameters obtained from the basic ARX-based model are used to predict the output. The results show that the ARX-based model has a higher prediction error compared to the instrument variable-based model. This is because the instrument variable-based model eliminates endogeneity and produces unbiased and consistent estimates of the parameters.
The moving average noise model based on Pseudo-Linear Regression is another modification that can be made to the basic RLS algorithm. The Pseudo-Linear Regression technique is used to model time series data. It is used to estimate parameters in a linear regression model with an autoregressive moving average errors (ARMA).
The moving average noise model based on Pseudo-Linear Regression involves adding two terms to the basic RLS equation. The first term is the difference between the current observation and the predicted observation. The second term is the difference between the current error and the previous error multiplied by the moving average coefficient.
The results obtained from incorporating the moving average noise model based on Pseudo-Linear Regression in the RLS algorithm are compared with those of the basic ARX-based model. The results show that the moving average noise model produces a lower prediction error compared to the basic ARX-based model. This is because the moving average noise model accounts for the autocorrelation in the errors by adding a term that depends on the previous error.
In conclusion, the modifications made to the basic RLS algorithm, namely incorporating an instrument variable and a moving average noise model based on Pseudo-Linear Regression, can significantly improve its performance. The instrument variable-based model eliminates endogeneity, while the moving average noise model accounts for the autocorrelation in the errors. The results obtained from these modifications show that they produce lower prediction errors compared to the basic ARX-based model. Therefore, incorporating these modifications in the RLS algorithm can lead to more accurate modeling and better estimation of system parameters.
