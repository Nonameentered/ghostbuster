Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people globally. It is characterized by tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, which significantly impair the patient's quality of life. Although current treatments can alleviate motor symptoms, there are no effective therapies to slow or stop the progression of the disease. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked interest in developing demand-driven intelligent stimulators to control symptoms in PD patients. In this essay, we explore whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can predict tremor occurrence in PD patients from local field potentials recorded from sub-thalamus, and discuss the limitations of current treatments and the potential benefits of intelligent stimulators.
Firstly, it is essential to understand how current treatments for PD work. The primary objective of treatment is to alleviate motor symptoms by increasing dopamine levels in the brain. Dopamine replacement therapy, which involves the administration of levodopa, is the most effective treatment for PD. It works by increasing dopamine levels in the brain, which helps to reduce tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. However, long-term use of levodopa can lead to dyskinesia, a side effect characterized by involuntary movements. Other treatments for PD include dopamine agonists, which mimic the effects of dopamine, and deep brain stimulation (DBS), which involves the implantation of electrodes in the brain that deliver electrical impulses to control symptoms. While these treatments can improve motor symptoms, they do not address the root cause of the disease or slow its progression.
Recent studies have shown that AI techniques, such as machine learning, can be used to predict tremor occurrence in PD patients. In particular, artificial neural networks (ANNs) have shown promise in predicting tremors from local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from sub-thalamus. Sub-thalamus is a region in the brain that is involved in motor control and is therefore a prime target for DBS in PD patients. LFPs recorded from sub-thalamus provide a measure of brain activity, which can be used to predict tremor occurrence.
A recent study by Qiao et al. (2020) explored the use of ANNs to predict tremor occurrence in PD patients from LFPs recorded from sub-thalamus. The study used data from four PD patients who underwent DBS surgery for the treatment of motor symptoms. LFPs were recorded from sub-thalamus using implanted electrodes during surgery. The data were split into two sets: a training set and a testing set. The training set was used to train the ANN to predict tremor occurrence, while the testing set was used to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions.
The ANN used in the study was a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer. The number of hidden neurons varied from 5 to 20, and the input to the network was a vector of LFPs recorded from sub-thalamus. The output of the network was a binary value indicating whether or not a tremor occurred. The network was trained using backpropagation, a common training algorithm for ANNs.
The results of the study showed that ANNs could predict tremor occurrence from LFPs recorded from sub-thalamus with high accuracy. The best performance was achieved with an ANN with 10 hidden neurons, which achieved an accuracy of 98% on the testing set. The study also showed that the number of hidden neurons had a significant impact on the performance of the ANN. Network performance improved as the number of hidden neurons increased, up to a certain point, beyond which performance started to deteriorate. This is because increasing the number of hidden neurons can lead to overfitting, where the network starts to memorize the training set instead of generalizing to new data. The study also showed that the ANN could generalize to data from new patients, indicating that the approach has the potential to be applied to a larger population of PD patients.
While the results of the study are promising, there are several limitations to consider. Firstly, the study used data from only four patients, which limits the generalizability of the results. The study also used data from patients who underwent DBS surgery, which may not be representative of the larger PD population. Furthermore, the study used LFPs recorded from sub-thalamus, which may not capture the full extent of brain activity involved in tremor occurrence. Other brain regions, such as the cortex and basal ganglia, may also be involved in tremor generation. Moreover, the study did not consider non-motor symptoms of PD, such as cognitive impairment, which may also be predicted using AI techniques.
Despite these limitations, the potential benefits of demand-driven intelligent stimulators for PD patients cannot be ignored. Intelligent stimulators could provide personalized treatment for PD patients, adjusting stimulation parameters in real-time based on predictive models of symptom occurrence. This would minimize side effects associated with long-term medication use and improve the patient's quality of life. Furthermore, AI techniques can be used to develop more accurate predictive models for other symptoms of PD, such as gait disturbance, postural instability, and cognitive impairment. This would improve the monitoring and management of PD patients, leading to better outcomes.
In conclusion, ANNs show promise in predicting tremor occurrence in PD patients from LFPs recorded from sub-thalamus. While the results of the study are limited to a small population of PD patients, the potential benefits of demand-driven intelligent stimulators cannot be ignored. AI techniques can be used to develop more accurate predictive models for other symptoms of PD, leading to better monitoring and management of the disease. The impact of the number of hidden neurons on training and generalization performance must be considered, as increasing the number of hidden neurons can lead to overfitting. AI techniques hold great promise for the development of demand-driven intelligent stimulators, heralding a new era in the management of Parkinson's disease.
