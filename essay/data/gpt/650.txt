Introduction
The development of international relations theory has been shaped by an ongoing debate between realists and liberals. Realist theorists consider international politics as inherently anarchic, driven by states' self-interest and conflict. On the other hand, liberal theorists suggest that cooperation, democracy, and morality can create an international society. However, the realist critique of liberalism raises questions about the underlying assumptions of liberal internationalism. The core liberal assumption is the importance of ideas and morality in building an international society. This essay will examine the ambiguity of the realist critique towards liberal internationalism and explore the underlying questions of the First Debate of International Relations. Additionally, the essay will explore how and why realists have borrowed ideas from liberalism, rendering their critique ambiguous.
The Ambiguity of the Realist Critique towards Liberal Internationalism
Realists and liberals have very different views on international relations, with the former emphasizing the need for power and the latter emphasizing the importance of ideas and morality. Realists view international politics through a realpolitik lens, which is based on power politics. Therefore, international relations are anarchic, conflictual, and driven by state self-interest. Realists argue that states pursue their self-interest by employing their military and economic powers to secure their national interests. The dominant paradigm in international politics is the balance of power, which assumes that states will always try to maximize their power to ensure their security, leading to a constant state of insecurity.
Liberals disagree with this view and argue that international politics can be cooperative and peaceful. Liberals contend that states' actions are not only driven by self-interest but influenced by ideas and morality. In other words, there are international norms, institutions, and laws that can create a society of states with mutual interests, shared values, and obligations. Moreover, the liberal tradition believes in the possibility of making progress towards a more democratic and peaceful world.
Realist critique of liberal internationalism centers around the issue of morality and the extent to which it can shape state behavior. Realists argue that morality is a product of national interest, rather than the other way around. Morality is subjective and varies across borders. Therefore, the international community cannot agree on universal values and principles. According to the realist perspective, the altruistic motives of liberalism are unrealistic, and states will never put collective interests above national interests. Additionally, realists accuse liberals of hypocrisy since liberal states often violate the very principles they advocate for and engage in covert operations, espionage, and coercion to enforce their interests.
The Realist "Borrowing" from Liberalism
Despite the realist critique of liberal internationalism, realist scholars have borrowed and adapted some liberal ideas. For example, realism emphasizes the importance of international institutions as tools for managing conflicts and promoting cooperation. Realist scholars such as Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer have acknowledged the role of institutions in constraining states' behavior, mitigating conflicts, and promoting cooperation. Moreover, realists advocate for the balance of power, which provides stability and prevents the dominance of a single power or hegemon. The balance of power is based on the assumption that states can cooperate when there is no dominant state, and they share a common fear of an aggressive state.
Furthermore, Realists have borrowed some of the liberal ideas concerning world order. Realists acknowledge that cooperation is necessary to address global issues like climate change and terrorism. They suggest that states should pursue their interests but do so through diplomacy rather than coercion. Additionally, some realists argue that nation-states should be replaced by a more globalized system of governance, while others suggest that international institutions can serve as the foundation for a global society.
The ambiguity in the Realist Critique of Liberal internationalism stems from the fact that critiques of liberalism echo some of the theory's tenets. Borrowing liberal ideals such as international institutions and global governance, realists have attempted to integrate these concepts within their framework of power politics. On the one hand, Realist scholars praise the benefits of international cooperation and emphasize the role of institutions in preventing conflict. On the other hand, realists still focus on power, self-interest, and the balance of power as the driving forces behind international politics.
The Underlying Questions of the First Debate of International Relations
The First Debate of International Relations in the early 20th century was characterized by the search for universal principles and values that could create an international society. The debate focused on several questions about the nature of international politics, including the possibility of common interests, moral visions, cooperation, and the abolition of war.
One of the central questions that emerged during the First Debate was whether states have common interests. Realists argue that states have divergent interests based on geography, security, and economics. Therefore, cooperation is difficult to achieve since states have different strategic perspectives. Liberals, on the other hand, suggest that states have shared interests, including economic growth, security, and the promotion of democracy and human rights.
Another question that emerged during the First Debate concerned the role of morality in international relations. Realists argue that morality is subjective, and different cultures and societies have different moral codes. Therefore, morality cannot provide a basis for cooperation. Liberals, on the other hand, suggest that morality can create an international society based on shared values, human dignity, and peace.
The First Debate also dealt with the question of cooperation. Realists argue that cooperation is difficult to achieve since states seek to maximize their power and protect their national interests. International institutions can be designed to mitigate conflicts, but they cannot force states to cooperate. Liberals contend that cooperation can be achieved through international institutions, dialogue, and diplomacy. Multilateralism can provide a framework for states to pursue common goals and interests.
Furthermore, the First Debate raised the question of the abolition of war. Realists argue that war is an inherent feature of international politics and cannot be abolished. Instead, states must focus on managing conflicts and preventing them from escalating into war. Liberals argue that war is not inevitable, and cooperation among states can lead to a world without war. Moreover Liberal International Theory puts a lot of emphasis on democratization, arguing that democratic states are less likely to go to war with each other.
Conclusion
The realist critique of liberal internationalism raises important questions about the assumptions and goals of liberalism. However, the ambiguity of the critique comes from the fact that realists acknowledge the role of morality and international institutions in promoting cooperation and stability. Realist scholars have borrowed and adapted some liberal ideas into their theoretical framework, making their critique complicated and debated. The First Debate of International Relations remains relevant today as scholars continue to question the possibilities of cooperation, universalization of moral values, the role of norms and institutions and the abolition of war. Consequently, understanding the underlying questions that the debate raised would help answer the necessary policy questions regarding cooperation, power balancing, national interests and how peace can be achieved.
