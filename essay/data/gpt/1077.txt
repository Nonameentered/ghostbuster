Whaling is the practice of hunting whales for commercial purposes such as blubber, meat, oil, and bones. It has a long and controversial history, and despite increased understanding of the negative impacts of whaling on whale populations and the environment, some countries continue the practice today. This essay will discuss the history of commercial whaling, the currently enacted regulations, the primary species hunted today, the countries that continue to whale, and the primary aim of Iceland's whaling program and the international community's response to it.
The history of commercial whaling can be traced back to the 11th century when the Basques hunted North Atlantic right whales for their blubber. European whaling became more organized and profitable in the 17th century, and as technology improved, whaling spread to other parts of the world. By the 19th century, whaling fleets were operating in nearly all the world's oceans. Whaling was a lucrative industry, and whale oil was a valuable commodity used for lighting and lubrication. However, it quickly became apparent that whaling was not sustainable, and whale populations began to decline rapidly.
In response, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) was established in 1946 to regulate whaling and protect whale populations. The IWC initially aimed to reduce the number of whales killed, but it was not until the 1980s that a moratorium on commercial whaling was put in place. Several countries, including Japan, Norway, and Iceland, objected to the moratorium and continued to hunt whales.
Today, there are several regulations in place to regulate whaling. In addition to the IWC's moratorium on commercial whaling, other measures include the creation of whale sanctuaries, restrictions on hunting methods, and established quotas for aboriginal subsistence whaling. Despite these measures, there are still countries that continue to hunt whales.
The primary species hunted today include minke, humpback, and fin whales. Japan and Norway are the largest whaling nations, with Iceland also participating. Japan has come under intense scrutiny for its practice of "scientific whaling," which is widely seen as a cover for commercial whaling. Norway hunts for domestic consumption and export, while Iceland has a small commercial whaling industry that exists largely to supply the domestic market.
Iceland's whaling program has been particularly controversial. The country resumed commercial whaling in 2006, citing a need to protect the Icelandic fishing industry from competition with whales. The primary aim of Iceland's whaling program is to obtain meat for domestic consumption and for export to Japan. However, Iceland has faced significant opposition from the international community, with many countries and organizations condemning its whaling practices. The European Union, of which Iceland is a member state, has put in place trade restrictions on Icelandic whaling products.
In conclusion, whaling has a long and controversial history and has had a significant impact on whale populations and the environment. Despite increased understanding of the negative impacts of whaling, some countries continue the practice today. The International Whaling Commission regulates whaling and has put in place several measures to protect whale populations, but there are still countries that continue to hunt whales, including Japan, Norway, and Iceland. Iceland's whaling program has faced significant opposition from the international community, and the country has been the subject of trade restrictions. The future of commercial whaling remains uncertain, but it is clear that continued efforts will be needed to protect whale populations and the environment.
