The Private Language Argument, proposed primarily by Ludwig Wittgenstein, poses significant difficulties for Descartes' philosophy. Descartes maintained that knowledge could be attained through clear and distinct ideas that were innate in the mind. However, the Private Language Argument highlights the difficulties in addressing the nature of language acquisition, which is required for innate ideas to be accurately grasped and understood.
The Private Language Argument is built on Wittgenstein's belief that language is a public phenomenon and requires a shared understanding between speakers. Wittgenstein argues that it is not possible to form a private language, meaning that a language can only exist if it is shared by others. A private language restricts the understanding of the world to the individual. Wittgenstein used the example of a man counting - "one, two, three" - pebbles in his pocket to highlight the difficulties with a private language. The counting may be appropriate for the individual, but without a shared, agreed-upon meaning of the words "one," "two," and "three," it is impossible for anyone else to understand what the man means by counting the pebbles. In this way, the Private Language Argument proposes that language requires a shared understanding, which requires it to be public.
Descartes' philosophy is built around the concept of innate ideas, which are said to exist in the mind before any experience is gained. Descartes believed that these innate ideas were clear and distinct, and therefore could be used to attain certain knowledge. However, this approach has been criticized as it relies on language acquisition, which is central to understanding these innate ideas.
Language acquisition is a critical component of understanding innate ideas as they rely on language to be conveyed. Wittgenstein argues that the acquisition of language is a public and social process - we learn the meanings of words through experiences with others by following communal practices. It is therefore impossible for an individual to develop a private language as it would require that the person invent the meanings of words themselves, without relying on communal practices. This understanding is central to understanding why Descartes' philosophy faces difficulties in the face of the Private Language Argument.
Descartes believed that human beings could access innate ideas that exist within the mind. These innate ideas do not require language to express themselves, as they are innate. However, once these ideas are expressed, language acquisition is required to understand and explain them. Descartes believed that innate ideas could be accessed intuitively, without requiring any external explanation. But this is where the Private Language Argument poses a problem for Descartes as it is possible for an individual to develop a private language based on their intuitive understanding of innate ideas. This private language would be incomprehensible to others, and its claims about these innate ideas would not be testable.
To be clear, it is not the concept of innate ideas in and of itself that is problematic. Rather, it is the claim that these ideas are clear and distinct, and can be communicated without adopting a shared understanding of language. This belief is radical as it suggests that one can apprehend the truth about the world without the need for external justification. It is this belief that the Private Language Argument challenges, as it demonstrates the indispensability of language in apprehending and conveying knowledge about the world. 
Furthermore, Descartes' theory of clear and distinct ideas relies heavily on the language of mathematics. Mathematics is a formal language and is, for the most part, immune to ambiguity. The use of mathematical language ensures that there can be no miscommunication between individuals, as the meaning of symbols and terms are fixed and shared among mathematicians. However, this is not true for all domains of knowledge.
Consider the domain of ethics. Ethical language is much less formalized than mathematical language and thus can give rise to a variety of interpretations of concepts such as "good" and "right." This has led some philosophers to argue that ethical statements are merely expressions of subjective preferences rather than objective facts. This is a complicated issue as some ethical terms, like "murder," have clear definitions, while others, like "goodness," do not. However, the point here is that the ambiguity of language in the domain of ethics can give significant leeway to private interpretations of concepts. If one were to develop a private language to analyze ethical terms, it would be difficult to test the validity of that analysis. This is a serious problem for Descartes' philosophy, given that ethics is a domain in which we rely heavily on language to communicate our views.
The Private Language Argument also challenges Descartes' belief that language can be used to express clear and distinct ideas. Wittgenstein asserts that the meaning of words is deeply dependent on the context in which they are used, and that the same word can have multiple meanings, depending on the context. Wittgenstein used the concept of language games to capture this idea. Language games refer to the ways in which language is used to perform various functions in different contexts. The meaning of words is, therefore, continually shifting as the context changes.
This shifts in meaning pose a serious problem for Descartes. If language is context-dependent, then it is difficult to see how it is possible to attain the sort of clear, distinct ideas that Descartes believed are necessary for certain knowledge. Descartes believed that language can be used to convey knowledge of the essential natures of things. However, if meaning is contextual and shifts depending on the context, then it is unclear how language can be used to express these essential natures accurately.
In conclusion, Descartes' philosophy meets significant difficulties when viewed through the lens of the Private Language Argument. The Private Language Argument critiques Descartes' belief that language is a private affair that can be used to express clear and distinct ideas. Wittgenstein argued for a view of language as a public, communal phenomenon that is deeply embedded in communities. The Private Language Argument poses difficulties for Descartes, given that his philosophy requires the private apprehension of innate ideas. These innate ideas are not expressed in language, but understanding them requires language acquisition and acquisition of the context-dependent meanings of words. Furthermore, some domains of knowledge, such as ethics, are highly dependent on language and can, therefore, be subject to radically different private interpretations. Ultimately, the Private Language Argument highlights the importance of shared knowledge and understanding within communities for the acquisition of knowledge.
