The late nineteenth century was a time of great change in many aspects of life, including gender roles. British imperialism played a significant role in shaping these gender identities, as portrayed in adventure stories. These stories often depict traditional gender roles and stereotypes, which were reinforced by the imperialist ideals of the time. In this essay, I will explore how these gender identities were shaped and reinforced through adventure stories, and how they reflected the broader context of imperialism in the late nineteenth century.
One of the most prominent themes in adventure stories of the late nineteenth century was the idea of the “manly” hero. Male characters are often depicted as strong, brave, and adventurous, always ready to face danger and take on physical challenges. This ideal was shaped by the imperialist values of the time, which placed a high value on physical strength and martial prowess. The British Empire was built on military conquest and exploration, and this emphasis on strength and bravery was seen as essential to maintaining imperial power.
Women, on the other hand, were often relegated to secondary roles in adventure stories. They were depicted as passive, delicate, and in need of protection from the male hero. This reflected the broader context of the Victorian era, in which women were expected to be virtuous and obedient, and their main role was seen as supporting the men around them. In adventure stories, this often took the form of the female character providing emotional support to the male hero, or assisting him in more practical ways, such as acting as a nurse or cook.
However, there were also some female characters in adventure stories who challenged these gender norms. These “strong women” were often depicted as tomboyish and independent, with skills that were traditionally associated with men, such as riding horses or shooting guns. They were also portrayed as intelligent and capable, and able to hold their own in male-dominated spaces. These characters challenged the idea that women were inherently weaker or less capable than men, and suggested that gender roles were not fixed or natural, but could be negotiated and redefined.
One example of a strong female character in adventure stories of the late nineteenth century is the character of Jane in Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Tarzan of the Apes. Jane is initially portrayed as a typical Victorian woman, delicate and in need of protection. However, as the story progresses, she begins to show a more adventurous and independent side. She learns to ride horses, shoot guns, and even helps Tarzan rescue other characters. While Tarzan is still seen as the hero and the leader, Jane’s role is elevated from that of a typical female sidekick to a more active and equal participant in the story.
However, it is important to note that these strong female characters were often still depicted in a sexualized or objectified way. They were often described as beautiful or seductive, and their physical appearance was often highlighted even when it was not relevant to the plot. This reflected the broader context of imperialist culture, in which women were often seen as objects of desire or conquest. This is exemplified by the character of H. Rider Haggard’s She, who is both a powerful ruler and an object of desire, with the male characters in the story both admiring and fearing her.
Similarly, male characters in adventure stories were often portrayed in a way that reinforced traditional gender norms. They were expected to be strong, brave, and aggressive, and to take charge of situations. This ideal is exemplified by the character of Allan Quatermain in Haggard’s King Solomon’s Mines. Quatermain is portrayed as a tough, experienced adventurer who is not afraid to take on dangerous situations. He is also depicted as having a certain degree of moral superiority, as he fights against evil forces in order to secure wealth and power for the British Empire.
However, even within this framework, there were still opportunities for male characters to challenge traditional gender roles. One example of this is the character of Jim Hawkins in Robert Louis Stevenson’s Treasure Island. Jim is initially described as a “quiet, helpful boy” who is not particularly adventurous or combative. However, as the story progresses, he becomes more confident and assertive, eventually taking on a leadership role among the group of characters. This suggests that gender roles were not fixed or absolute, but could be reshaped by different contexts and experiences.
Overall, adventure stories of the late nineteenth century played an important role in shaping and reinforcing gender identities. They reflected and reinforced the imperialist ideals of the time, with strong male heroes leading the way and women playing more passive or supportive roles. However, there were also examples of characters who challenged traditional gender norms, suggesting that gender roles were not fixed or natural, but could be redefined. Despite the limitations and biases of these stories, they remain an important record of the ways in which gender identities were formed and contested during this important historical period.
