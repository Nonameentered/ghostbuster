The period following the restoration of Charles the Second marked a significant change in the landscape of English drama. During this time, the country witnessed the emergence of a new style of playwriting that came to be known as Restoration Comedies. These plays were characterized by a witty and provocative tone and aimed to reflect the values of the time. In this essay, we shall discuss the different approaches to playwriting during this period and how they affected the components of different plays, especially Restoration Comedies. We will focus on the social and political values reflected in the plays and also examine the use of theatrical techniques by French and English cultures. We will also compare the differences in characterisation, humour, and the effectiveness of the plays in reflecting the society and manners of the period.
The period following the restoration of Charles the Second was marked by a revival of interest in theatre. The English stage had been closed for 18 years during the Commonwealth period, leading to the accumulation of a long-standing desire for entertainment. The Restoration was also a time of great change in English society. The era was characterized by a new-found elegance, wit, and glamour that was reflected in the theatres. The plays of this period were characterized by bawdy humour, wit, and eloquence. These plays emerged in an era that was dominated by English and French cultures, which affected the works of the playwrights. In England, the emphasis was more on the character and dialogue while in France, the emphasis was on the style and the improvement of theatres.
One of the most notable approaches to playwriting during the period following the Restoration of Charles the Second was the satirical approach. Satirical plays were characterized by the ridicule of social conventions, moral values, and authoritative institutions. Restoration Comedies, in particular, were satirical in their approach, taking a lighter view of the social conventions and morals of the time. The plays were full of wit, sexual innuendos, and puns, and aimed to undermine the rigid societal norms of the time. These plays criticized the behavior of the aristocracy, the church, and society in general, and encouraged the audiences to question their values and norms. Examples of Restoration Comedies that used satire as a tool of social criticism were William Wycherley's "The Country Wife," William Congreve's "The Way of the World," and George Etherege's "The Man of Mode."
One of the most significant examples of the satirical approach in Restoration Comedy is "The Country Wife." The play satirizes the hypocrisy of the upper class in the society. The plot follows Horner, a man seeking to seduce as many women as possible while pretending to be impotent. The play is full of sexual innuendos, and the character of Horner is the epitome of the libertine hero. Throughout the play, the audience is encouraged to question the moral values of the society and reflect on the reality of the aristocracy.
Another approach to playwriting during the period following the Restoration of Charles the Second was the sentimental approach. Sentimental plays targeted the emotions of the audience and aimed to elevate their feelings. These plays were melodramatic, emphasizing the pathos of the story and the characters' emotions. The plays typically had happy endings and encouraged moral behavior. Sentimental plays were popular in the early 1700s and were aimed at women. Examples of such plays were Nicholas Rowe's "The Fair Penitent" and Richard Steele's "The Tender Husband."
The sentimental approach reflected the political and social values of the time. It aimed to promote the virtues of Christianity, morality, and domesticity, which were seen as necessary for the growth and stability of society. The plays aimed to encourage the audience to empathize with the emotions of the characters, and the characters themselves were often depicted as virtuous and good. Sentimental plays were seen as a reaction to the excesses of Restoration Comedies and were aimed at setting a moral standard for the society.
One of the most significant examples of sentimentality in Restoration Comedy is "The Fair Penitent" by Nicholas Rowe. The play tells the story of Calista, a woman who has committed adultery and is full of remorse. The play emphasizes the emotional turmoil of the character, and the audience is encouraged to feel empathy for her. The play is structured around the idea of repentance and forgiveness, and the moral lesson that it seeks to impart is that even those who have sinned can be redeemed.
The differences between the satirical and sentimental approaches to playwriting were reflected in the characterization and humour of the plays. Satirical plays tended to have more complex characters who were often portrayed as flawed and hypocritical. These plays were humorous, relying on witty dialogue and sexual innuendos. They encouraged the audience to question the values and norms of the society, asking them to reflect on the moral standards that they lived by. Sentimental plays, on the other hand, had simpler characters who were more virtuous. These plays had less humour and were structured around emotional drama. They encouraged the audience to empathize with the characters and reflect on the emotions that they were feeling.
In terms of effectiveness, Restoration Comedies were more effective in reflecting the society and manners of the period. The plays reflected the excesses of the time and the societal norms that were prevalent. They allowed the audience to question the values of the society and encouraged them to think about the moral standards that were being followed. Sentimental plays were less effective in reflecting the society and were more focused on promoting moral values. They were useful in setting a moral standard for the society, but they did not reflect the excesses and contradictions of the time as effectively as Restoration Comedies.
In conclusion, the period following the Restoration of Charles the Second marked a significant change in the English drama. The emergence of Restoration Comedies reflected the values of the time and the different approaches to playwriting that were prevalent. Satirical plays aimed to critique social conventions, moral values, and authoritative institutions, encouraging the audience to question their values and norms. Sentimental plays were melodramatic and aimed at promoting moral values. Restoration Comedies were more effective in reflecting the society and manners of the period, and their witty and provocative tone made them popular among audiences. The different approaches to playwriting reflected the social and political values of the time and the different cultural influences that were prevalent in English society.
