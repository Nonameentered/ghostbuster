Reflecting on Challenging Situation Experienced while on Placement in the Accident and Emergency Department
The hospital is a place where people visit to receive medical assistance while unwell. As a nursing student, the hospital was my second home throughout my placement. While there, I worked in the Accident and Emergency (A&E) department. This department handles patients with urgent medical needs. There was a situation that I encountered while on placement in the A&E department that I found to be challenging, and this essay seeks to discuss the situation and the strategies used to handle it. Additionally, the essay will use Holm and Stephenson's (1994) model of reflection to explain why I found the situation challenging and the lessons learned from it.
The incident that I encountered happened on a Friday evening. The department was packed, and there were only a few nurses working. A patient was wheeled in by the ambulance and was severely injured. The healthcare assistants rushed to welcome the patient, while the physicians handled the critical patient's care. This was a severe trauma, and the patient must have been on a bike when he was involved in an accident. I could not tell exactly what happened, but all I knew was that he needed urgent medical attention.
The patient had serious head injuries, a broken arm, and several fractures on his leg. As soon as the patient arrived, the doctors needed to provide treatment fast. However, we encountered a challenge because of a shortage of patient monitors. All the available monitors were in use and we were running out of time. The patient needed to be monitored and receive treatment. Without the monitor, it was difficult for the healthcare team to determine the patient's vital signs, and provide medication or oxygen accordingly.
The situation was tough on the patients' family members. They continuously inquired about their son's condition, and the lack of monitors only added to their stress and concern. The doctor handling the situation had to inform the family about the unavailability of the monitor and the results that could come with it. The family members were not happy, and a few of them were even aggressive towards the healthcare team. It was evident that they were frustrated and anxious.
The family's reaction and the situation at hand was challenging to handle. The family members were looking up to the healthcare team to provide assistance, but the unavailability of monitors had limited our capabilities. The language used by the family members was aggressive, and it was not going well. At this point, the healthcare team had to remain calm to avoid escalating the situation. The nurses present had to use their communication skills to explain the situation and what the medical team was doing to resolve it. Although some family members were still upset, this approach helped diffuse the situation.
As a student, watching the event unfold, I could see how teamwork played an essential role in handling this challenging situation. Every healthcare worker had a part to play, and everyone was working for the benefit of the patient. The physicians needed the nurses to provide support, the healthcare assistants were attending to the other patients, and the pharmacists were working hard to provide the required medication. Everyone worked together to try and get the patient stable before being admitted to the ward.
Holm and Stephenson's (1994) model of reflection explains that reflection involves evaluating an experience to develop a new understanding of it and inform future actions. It consists of three parts, namely, description, reflection, and action.
In the description phase, the situation is outlined and its relevance highlighted. In this case, a trauma patient arrived in the A&E department, and it was challenging to handle him due to a lack of patient monitors. The patient's family members were also upset about the situation. The healthcare team had to work together and communicate effectively to diffuse the situation.
In the reflection phase, one is required to explore their emotions and thoughts about the experience. During this situation, I felt nervous, anxious, and overwhelmed. As a nursing student, I had never encountered a challenging situation like this, and I was unsure how to handle myself. However, observing the healthcare team's communication skills and teamwork allowed me to learn how to handle such situations effectively. I realized that communication plays a crucial role in patient care. Being empathetic with the family members and using clear communication helped diffuse the situation.
In the third and final step, the action, I developed a plan of action based on the experience. I learned that when faced with a challenging situation like this, I need to stay calm and communicate effectively with the patients and their families. Additionally, teamwork is essential, and everyone should work together to provide patients with the best care possible.
In conclusion, the experience I encountered while on placement in the A&E department was challenging. The lack of patient monitors, coupled with a severely injured patient, presented a difficult situation for healthcare workers. However, observing teamwork and clear communication strategies made the situation easier to handle. Making use of Holm and Stephenson's (1994) model of reflection has helped me to develop a better understanding of the experience and to utilize the lessons learned in future situations.
