Introduction:
National identity is a crucial aspect of a society. It is the recognition of oneself as a member of a larger community which shares a common history, culture, and values. Nationalistic education aims to cultivate the sense of national identity and pride among students, and it plays a vital role in shaping their perception of the world and their place in society. In the context of Hong Kong, the transmission of national identity is a complex and contentious issue, especially after the handover of the territory from the British to Chinese government in 1997. This essay will assess the extent to which Hong Kong secondary schools successfully transmit national identity, the challenges they face, and how perceptions and practices around nationalistic education have changed in the last 10 years. It will also examine the differences in understanding of nationalistic education between schools with different backgrounds, teacher's perception of their role in disseminating nationalistic education, and whether nationalistic education can be cultivated through market economy.
Success of National Identity transmission in Hong Kong Secondary Schools:
Hong Kong is a unique cultural and historical enclave, and this has presented a challenge on how to define and transmit national identity. Since the handover of the territory from the British to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, the Chinese Communist Party has been keen to instill patriotic education among Hong Kong students. The government has put forth policies aimed at promoting national identity, including the introduction of national education curriculum in primary and secondary schools in 2012.
The degree of success of national identity transmission in Hong Kong secondary schools remains complex. This is attributed to several factors such as the historical experiences, political contexts, and socio-cultural differences between Hong Kong and mainland China. While the government has promoted nationalistic education, some educators view it as an attempt to indoctrinate the younger generation of Hong Kong and promote mainland China's political ideology and agenda. However, some schools have successfully cultivated a sense of national identity among the students.
Several evidence shows that nationalistic education has become a core aspect of Hong Kong secondary education. A survey conducted by the Hong Kong Institute of Education in 2018 found that around 80% of schools in Hong Kong provided programs and activities aimed at promoting national identity. In addition, schools have been hosting activities such as visiting national historic sites in mainland China, inviting mainlander guest speakers, and organizing cultural exchange programs to expose students to the country's culture and traditions. These efforts have been successful in enhancing the students' understanding of China's history, culture, and traditions.
Challenges Faced by Nationalistic Education in Hong Kong:
Despite the efforts to promote nationalistic education, several factors are hindering its success in Hong Kong secondary schools. One of the major challenges is resistance from some members of Hong Kong society, who view nationalistic education as a threat to their local identity and autonomy. They view the government's policies as an attempt to promote mainland Chinese identity and suppress Hong Kong identity. This has led to protests and other forms of civil disobedience.
Another challenge is the lack of professional development and support for teachers to effectively teach nationalistic education. Teachers in Hong Kong require specialized training to be able to teach nationalistic education effectively. However, most teachers view nationalistic education as an additional burden to a system that is already heavily focused on academics. As a result, there is a lack of dedicated training and professional development specifically focused on nationalistic education.
Lastly, the concerns around freedom of speech and academic freedom is another challenge that has hindered the success of nationalistic education in Hong Kong. The government's attempt to promote nationalistic education has led to concerns over censorship and limitations on academic freedom. This, in turn, has created further resistance from teachers and students who feel that their freedoms are being curtailed.
Changes in Perceptions and Practices in Nationalistic Education:
The past ten years have seen significant changes in perceptions and practices around nationalistic education in Hong Kong secondary schools. In 2012, the Hong Kong government proposed to introduce a new subject called Moral and National Education (MNE), which was aimed at instilling a sense of national identity and patriotism among young Hong Kongers. However, the introduction of the curriculum led to student-led protests, and the government withdrew its plan to introduce MNE as a compulsory subject.
However, the government's efforts to promote national identity and patriotism have continued, and schools are increasingly adopting strategies such as including national themes in their curriculum, hosting cultural exchange programs, and incorporating nationalistic symbols and themes into their school culture. A survey conducted by the Hong Kong Institute of Education in 2018 found that around 80% of schools provided programs and activities aimed at promoting national identity.
Different Backgrounds and Teacher's Role in Disseminating Nationalistic Education:
Hong Kong is home to students from diverse cultural, social, and ethnic backgrounds. Schools with different backgrounds have varying understandings of nationalistic education. For instance, international schools in Hong Kong with students from different countries have a different understanding of the subject because it involves instilling a sense of patriotism and belonging to Hong Kong rather than promoting Chinese national identity. Similarly, schools with different socio-economic backgrounds have different understandings of nationalistic education.
Teachers in Hong Kong perceive their role as disseminators of nationalistic education differently. Some see themselves as responsible for instilling patriotism and national identity in students, while others view their role as teaching critical thinking, Chinese and global cultures and human values. Furthermore, the perception amongst teachers varies based on their socio-economic background, political leanings, and educational philosophy.
Cultivation of Nationalistic Education through Market Economy:
The role of market economy in cultivating nationalistic education in Hong Kong is contentious. Unlike mainland China, Hong Kong's economic system is largely free-market oriented. However, this has not precluded the promotion of nationalistic education in the territory. The government has been keen on promoting nationalistic education through market-oriented strategies such as cultural and educational exchange programs.
Additionally, firms operating in Hong Kong can participate in promoting nationalistic education by sponsoring activities such as scholarships, cultural programs, and educational tours. However, some experts argue that reliance on market forces for the promotion of nationalistic education is not a viable long-term solution as it may lead to a commercialization of education and the promotion of private interests over national interest.
Conclusion:
In conclusion, the promotion of nationalistic education in Hong Kong secondary schools is a contested issue. The success of national identity transmission in secondary schools depends on various factors such as historical experiences, political contexts, and socio-cultural differences between Hong Kong and mainland China. While the government has put forth policies aimed at promoting nationalistic education, there is resistance from some members of Hong Kong society, who view it as a threat to their local identity and autonomy. Despite the challenges faced in implementing nationalistic education, some schools have successfully cultivated a sense of national identity among the students. The role of market-oriented strategies in promoting nationalistic education remains contentious, and the government needs to explore more sustainable approaches. Teachers' perceptions of their role in disseminating nationalistic education differ based on their background, political leanings, and educational philosophy. Therefore, there is a need for continued dialogue on how to effectively teach nationalistic education in Hong Kong.
