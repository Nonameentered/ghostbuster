Introduction:
Leadership is one of the most important factors that affect the success or failure of an organization. Leaders are required to make decisions that drive the organization in the right direction. The success of any leader depends on the leadership style and decision-making process that they adopt. In this essay, we will discuss the leadership style and decision-making process that Gordon should have used in the situation with Harry and the forms in the warehouse, based on different theories and approaches to leadership.
Leadership Style:
Leadership style refers to the behavior and attitude of a leader when dealing with subordinates. Different leadership styles are appropriate for different situations. There are many leadership styles, including authoritarian, democratic, and laissez-faire leadership styles.
Authoritarian Leadership:
The authoritarian leadership style is characterized by leaders who make decisions without consulting their subordinates. It is a dominant leadership style where the leader has complete control over the organization. This leadership style is most suitable for situations that require a quick decision, such as in the case of an emergency or crisis situation.
Democratic Leadership:
The democratic leadership style is characterized by leaders who involve their subordinates in the decision-making process. This style is most appropriate for situations that require a collaborative effort to find a solution.
Laissez-Faire Leadership:
The laissez-faire leadership style is characterized by leaders who allow their subordinates to make decisions and take responsibility for their actions. This leadership style is most appropriate for situations where the subordinates have the required knowledge and experience to make the right decisions.
Gordon’s leadership style:
Gordon's leadership style was more authoritarian than democratic or laissez-faire. Gordon was a strict boss who demanded that his orders be obeyed without question. Gordon knew what he wanted, and he expected his subordinates to comply with his demands without fail. This attitude is exemplified by Gordon's warning to Harry that “you either do it my way, or you hit the highway.”
Gordon's leadership style was not appropriate for the situation he faced with Harry and the forms in the warehouse. Applying an authoritarian leadership style in this case, especially with Harry, who had many years of experience, would not yield positive results. In such a static situation, a democratic leadership style would be more effective.

Decision-Making Process:
Decision-making is an important element of leadership. The decision-making process that a leader uses is critical in determining the outcome of the decision. Different theories have proposed different decision-making processes. A leader can use a rational, intuitive, or creative decision-making process.
Rational Decision-making Process:
The rational decision-making process is a structured approach that involves analyzing the available information, identifying alternatives, and evaluating the options before selecting the best option. This approach is data-driven and objective.
Intuitive Decision-making Process:
The intuitive decision-making process is a less structured approach that relies on interpreting and understanding the situation based on a leader's instincts and past experience.
Creative Decision-making Process:
The creative decision-making process allows for exploring all possible options and alternatives with an open mind. This approach encourages brainstorming, and it relies on imagination, creativity, and innovation.
Gordon's decision-making style:
Gordon's decision-making style was not very effective in handling the situation with Harry and the forms in the warehouse. His approach was more of an intuition-based  decision-making process, where he relied more on his instincts rather than analyzing the situation before making a decision.
Gordon did not explore all the possible options before coming up with the decision to fire Harry. His approach was impulsive and one-sided, not taking into account Harry's many years of experience. This decision-making process was not appropriate for this situation, and it did not yield the desired outcome.
What leadership style and decision-making process should Gordon have used?
In the situation with Harry and the forms in the warehouse, Gordon should have used a more democratic leadership style and a rational decision-making process. A democratic leadership style would have allowed Gordon to involve Harry in the decision-making process. Harry would have been consulted and given a chance to make suggestions that would have led to a better outcome.
By involving subordinates in the decision-making process, Gordon could have fostered a sense of ownership and responsibility among the workers. Workers who feel that their opinions are heard and valued are more likely to be committed to the organization and more willing to put in the extra effort required to achieve organizational goals. Moreover, by giving Harry a chance to be part of the decision-making process, he would have felt respected, valued, and invested in the organizational culture.
A rational decision-making process that involves collecting data, analyzing alternatives, and evaluating options would have been more appropriate for the situation. A rational decision-making process would have allowed Gordon to evaluate all the alternatives before making a decision. It would have also allowed him to consider Harry's experience and expertise in handling the situation.
Gordon should have taken the following steps in implementing a rational decision-making process:
Step 1: Identify the problem and gather data.
Gordon should have identified the problem, in this case, it was the forms in the warehouse. He should have gathered data and analyzed the situation before making a decision.
Step 2: Generate alternatives.
After identifying the problem, Gordon should have generated several alternatives and evaluated them.
Step 3: Evaluate the alternatives.
Gordon should have evaluated the pros and cons of each alternative. He should have considered Harry's experience and expertise in the situation.
Step 4: Make a decision.
After evaluating the alternatives, Gordon should have made a decision based on the data available. If he had adopted this process, he could have avoided making an impulsive decision which could have led to the loss of an experienced and valuable employee.
Conclusion:
The success of any leader depends on the leadership style and decision-making process that they adopt. Gordon's authoritarian leadership style and impulsive decision-making process were not appropriate for the situation he faced with Harry and the forms in the warehouse. A democratic leadership style and a rational decision-making process would have been more effective, as they would have involved the subordinates in the decision-making process, and it would have allowed Gordon to evaluate all the alternatives before making a decision. Organizations need to cultivate a culture of trust, collaboration, and open communication between leaders and subordinates to foster innovation and sustainable growth. It is time for leaders to invest in the development of their leadership skills for the betterment of the organization and its stakeholders.
