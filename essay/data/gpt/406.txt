Contract law is a fundamental area of law that governs legal agreements and transactions between parties. Contracts are binding agreements between two or more parties, creating mutual obligations that are enforceable by law. The legal principles that guide the formation of contracts include the doctrines of consideration and intention to create legal relations. These two doctrines play a significant role in the formation of contracts, and their importance cannot be overstated. This essay will discuss the doctrines of consideration and intention to create legal relations, their relationship, and how they are important in the formation of contracts. Additionally, the essay will address some criticisms of their reliability and effectiveness by providing examples from case law.
The doctrine of consideration is a key element in the formation of a valid contract. The doctrine is rooted in the idea that any agreement should be supported by something of value, given by one party in exchange for something of value provided by the other party. Thus, consideration is an essential element of a contract that must be present for a contract to be enforceable. According to the principle of consideration, there must be a bargain between the parties, where each party must give something of some value to the other party. A contract with no consideration is not binding. For example, if a person promises to give another person a gift, but that gift is not given in exchange for something valuable, it is not binding.
In the case of Currie v Misa (1875) LR 10 Ex 153, Lord Dunedin defined consideration as "some right, interest, profit, or benefit accruing to the one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility given, suffered, or undertaken by the other." Consideration must also be present at the time of the agreement. This means that past consideration is not sufficient, and future consideration is not allowed. An example of the latter is where a bus conductor tells the passenger that he would receive a reward for finding his lost bag. This promise is not binding since it's about future consideration.
Intention to create legal relations is another important doctrine in the formation of contracts. The doctrine establishes whether or not parties intended to create legal obligations that can be enforced by law. In some cases, parties may not have had any intention to create a legal obligation, but instead, they are making a promise that is more of a social or personal nature. In such scenarios, a contract may not exist. The principle of intention to create legal relations is pivotal in establishing whether or not a contract exists in common law jurisdictions.
The doctrine of intention to create legal relations creates a rebuttable presumption that people who enter into commercial agreements or contractual relationships intend to create legal obligations that are legally enforceable. The presumption can be rebutted by demonstrating that the parties did not intend to create legal obligations either expressly or impliedly. For example, in the case of Balfour v Balfour (1919) 2 KB 571, a husband promised to pay his wife a monthly allowance, but when their relationship broke down, the husband refused to honour the promise. The wife sued the husband, but the court held that there was no intention to create legal relations as it was more of a domestic arrangement.
The two doctrines of consideration and intention to create legal relations are distinct. However, they are closely related since they both touch on the formation of contracts. The principles of consideration and intention to create legal relations ensure that the parties have entered into the agreement on an equal basis and with an intention to create legal obligations.
The doctrine of consideration is crucial in ensuring that both parties participate in contractual agreements with full awareness of their actions and obligations. It ensures that the parties do not enter into contracts on an unequal footing or under duress. The doctrine also guards against the potential of a one-sided obligation where one party gains at the expense of the other.
On the other hand, the doctrine of intention to create legal relations introduces an element of formality into contractual relationships. It helps distinguish social agreements from legal agreements that have the intention to create legal obligations. The principle ensures that there is a clear understanding of the parties’ intentions and obligations when entering into a contract.
Despite their importance in the formation of contracts, the reliability and effectiveness of the doctrines of consideration and intention to create legal relations have been criticized over time. Some have argued that consideration is an outdated doctrine that is overly rigid and can be too demanding. Critics argue that it creates unnecessary hurdles to contract formation, which discourages parties from entering into legally binding agreements. The courts have, however, been flexible in the application of the doctrine in certain circumstances.
Similarly, the doctrine of intention to create legal relations has been criticized for being inflexible. Critics argue that it is often difficult to establish whether the parties intended to create legal obligations, particularly in cases of social or domestic agreements. The courts have attempted to address this issue by focusing on the parties' actions and behaviour rather than their subjective intentions.
In conclusion, the doctrines of consideration and intention to create legal relations are instrumental in the formation of legally binding contracts. They act as a means of ensuring that parties enter into contracts voluntarily and with a clear understanding of their obligations. While the two doctrines are distinct, they have a close relationship in ensuring the validity of contractual relationships. Notably, there are some criticisms of the doctrines’ reliability and effectiveness, but the courts have attempted to mitigate these shortcomings by applying them flexibly to specific circumstances.
