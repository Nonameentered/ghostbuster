Introduction
The world is composed of many cultures, religions, and legal systems that make it difficult to comprehend every legal provision from one community to another. Non-state law is a set of rules and regulations imposed by religious leaders, indigenous tribal councils, and traditional communities. On the other hand, state law is legislated and enforced by the government. Legal systems vary depending on the context, which determines how crimes and violations are enforced and penalized. The recognition and application of non-state law differ significantly from state law in terms of punishing criminal offenses. Furthermore, international conflicts, the rise of globalization, and international trade have resulted in many legal issues at hand. In such cases, the choice of law is determined to ensure that the legal system applies in cases where parties are from different cultural, legal, and religious backgrounds. This essay examines how the application and recognition of non-state law differ from state law in terms of enforcing penalties and punishments. Moreover, it will discuss how the choice of law determines which legal system applies in cases where parties have different cultural, legal, and religious backgrounds.
Body
Enforcing Penalties and Punishment
One significant difference between the state and non-state legal systems is the way violations are dealt with and penalized. State law is legislated and enforced by the government, indicating that any violation or criminal offense is charged by a state prosecutor, while non-state law is enforced and penalized by religious leaders, indigenous tribal councils, and traditional communities. The punishment enforced depends on the norms and beliefs of a particular community, while state law is guided by legal statutes, judicial opinions, and constitutional provisions (Bakht, 2018). The communities that apply non-state law may not consider the crime as serious as the state would and; therefore, may penalize the individual involved in the acts differently. Moreover, the community may have different interpretations of the offense committed, which may be overlooked or punished less severely under non-state law than it would under state law. For instance, under Sharia law, adultery is considered a crime punishable by stoning, while in state law, it can be punished with jail time or other charges, depending on the gravity of the offense. 
The enforcement of punishment and penalty in non-state law doesn't follow a court procedure like it is done in state law. Unlike state law, non-state legal systems are not established and are not concerned with human rights or due process of the law. The procedure implemented in non-state laws is, therefore, arbitrary, and the process depends on the traditional leaders or elders of the community. The difficulty with this kind of system is that it often does not adhere to international human rights laws, and the penalties can be cruel or inhumane, such as cutting off hands for theft (Bakht, 2018). Furthermore, the execution of such punishments is done without proper amelioration measures like appeals or pardon mechanism.
In contrast, state law follows due process of the law and is concerned with the protection of human rights. The process of enforcing penalties is established and regulated by the law and follows the judicial system. This, therefore, implies that punishment is not arbitrarily enforced and must follow specific procedures. For example, once a case has been charged and found guilty in court, the perpetrator is given the opportunity to appeal the judgment. Similarly, punishment is regulated and should not be inhumane or humiliating, and therefore follows international human rights laws.
The Choice of Law
Conflict of laws or private international law is a legal practice that determines which legal system applies to issues originating from a party's different cultural, legal, and religious background. This happens when parties or legal entities' activities (e.g., trade, marriage, and employment) transcend national boundaries, and therefore their relationship is governed by different legal systems. The international issues also involve determining which legal system applies to issues relating to the different application of legal rules by two or more jurisdictions (Ó Cinnéide, 2015). 
The choice of law determines which legal system will apply in such cases. Parties and court systems must determine which legal system applies to contractual disputes, international trade, and personal issues such as marriage and divorce. For example, when parties trade across borders, there are four sets of law applicable that may affect the transaction under non-state law, i.e., the laws governing the contract, the law governing the parties, the law of the place of contract performance, and the law of the place of intended effect. The decision of which legal system applies is made primarily to prevent conflicts and disputes, ensure fairness, and guarantee access to justice.
In such cases, the parties involved may opt for a neutral legal system such as British common law or incorporate an arbitration clause in their agreement to resolve any disputes that might arise through arbitrators (Ó Cinnéide, 2015). Arbitration is done privately and is less formal than litigation; it allows for fast resolutions and confers confidentiality to the parties involved. The process is, therefore, a preferred resolution method for international disputes that involve parties from different legal, cultural, and religious backgrounds. The choice of law in this circumstance promotes autonomy and enables the parties involved to determine the best legal system to govern their dispute.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the application and recognition of non-state law differ significantly from state law in terms of enforcing penalties and punishments. The difference is because non-state legal systems such as religious law are enforced by traditional leaders or elders of a particular community, while state law follows the judicial process and is concerned with human rights. The choice of law, which determines which legal system applies to parties from different cultural, legal, and religious backgrounds, is therefore critical. The decision made should promote fairness, access to justice, and prevent disputes. Finally, the law governing individuals must be consistent with international human rights laws to ensure that individuals are not subject to inhumane, arbitrary, or cruel punishments.
