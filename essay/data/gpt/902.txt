Irish history is a complex tapestry that weaves together the political, social and economic threads of the country's past. Two of the most controversial figures of this tapestry are Eamon de Valera and Michael Collins, who were both instrumental in the Irish War of Independence and the subsequent formation of the Irish Free State. The portrayal of these two men in historical commentary has been the subject of much debate, particularly in the context of de Valera's comments about Collins in 1966. In this essay, I will examine the political ambition, political achievements, and mystique of both de Valera and Collins in order to comprehend their role in Irish history, while keeping in mind the social, political, and economic context within which they worked. I will also consider whether de Valera's failure to be remembered in a positive light may be due to political or social issues, and evaluate the criticisms that de Valera lacked social and economic policies.
Eamon de Valera was born in New York City in 1882, the son of an Irish mother and a Spanish father. He moved to Ireland as a child and became involved in the nationalist movement at a young age. In 1916, he was one of the leaders of the Easter Rising, and was subsequently imprisoned by the British. He was released in 1917 and became the leader of Sinn Féin, the political party devoted to the cause of Irish independence.
De Valera's political ambition was clear from the outset. He was a committed nationalist who believed in the principle of self-determination for Ireland. He was determined to achieve this goal through peaceful means if possible, but was willing to use violence if necessary. He was also a strong advocate for the preservation of Gaelic culture and language, which he believed were essential elements of Irish identity.
De Valera's political achievements were significant. He was one of the architects of the Irish War of Independence, which succeeded in forcing the British to negotiate a treaty that led to the establishment of the Irish Free State. He was also a key figure in the creation of the 1937 Constitution of Ireland, which enshrined the principles of Irish sovereignty, neutrality, and Gaelic culture. Finally, he was instrumental in the establishment of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), which played a crucial role in the fight for Irish independence.
Despite these achievements, de Valera's legacy is complex. He has been criticized for lacking social and economic policies, and for his focus on the goal of disengagement from Britain at the expense of other issues. He has also been accused of authoritarianism and of suppressing dissent during his time in power. His decision to remain neutral during World War II has also been controversial, as some see it as a betrayal of Ireland's traditional ties to Britain.
Michael Collins, on the other hand, was born in 1890 in County Cork. He became involved in the nationalist movement at a young age, and was a key figure in the Easter Rising of 1916. He was imprisoned by the British, but was released in 1918 to join the Sinn Féin party. He quickly rose through the ranks, and became director of intelligence for the IRA during the War of Independence.
Collins' political ambition was also clear from the outset. He was a charismatic leader who believed in the use of violence to achieve Irish independence. He was fiercely committed to the goal of Irish sovereignty, and believed in the principle of self-determination for Ireland. He was also an advocate for economic policies that would benefit the Irish people.
Collins' political achievements were also significant. He played a key role in the Irish War of Independence, and was one of the signatories of the Anglo-Irish Treaty that led to the establishment of the Irish Free State. He served as the first Minister for Finance in the Free State government, and implemented policies aimed at improving the economic situation of the country.
Despite these achievements, Collins' legacy is also complex. He has been criticized for the use of violent tactics during the War of Independence, which led to the deaths of many innocent people. He has also been accused of betraying the Republican cause by agreeing to the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which some felt did not go far enough in securing Irish sovereignty.
The comments that de Valera made about Collins in 1966 added another layer of complexity to the portrayal of these two figures in Irish history. De Valera described Collins as a "man of violence" who had betrayed the Republican cause by agreeing to the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. He also suggested that Collins had been responsible for the deaths of innocent people during the War of Independence.
Historiography has provided some evidence to support de Valera's comments about Collins. Many historians agree that Collins was a militant Republican who believed in the use of violence to achieve Irish independence. They also acknowledge that Collins played a key role in the establishment of the Free State, but that his decision to agree to the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty was controversial and divisive.
However, historians have also challenged de Valera's portrayal of Collins. They point out that Collins was not solely responsible for the decision to agree to the treaty, and that other Republicans were involved in the negotiations. They also argue that the deaths of innocent people during the War of Independence cannot be solely attributed to Collins, as the British were responsible for many of the atrocities committed during the conflict.
Ultimately, the political aspirations, achievements, and mystique surrounding both de Valera and Collins has had a significant impact on their portrayal in Irish history. De Valera is often remembered as a divisive figure who was more focused on disengagement from Britain than on social and economic policies. Collins, on the other hand, is often remembered as a hero who sacrificed his life in the fight for Irish independence.
It is worth considering, however, whether de Valera's failure to be remembered in a positive light is due in part to political or social issues. De Valera was a committed nationalist who believed in the principle of self-determination for Ireland, but his agenda was not always in line with the majority of Irish opinion. He was often criticized for his lack of social and economic policies, which were seen as essential by many ordinary Irish people.
Furthermore, de Valera's focus on disengagement from Britain can be seen as a reflection of Irish history and culture. Ireland had been subject to British rule for centuries, and many Irish people saw disengagement as the ultimate goal of the nationalist movement. De Valera may have prioritized this goal over other issues because he believed it was the key to achieving true Irish sovereignty.
In conclusion, the portrayal of Eamon de Valera and Michael Collins in historical commentary is complex and contingent on a variety of factors. Their political ambition, political achievements, and mystique are all important in understanding their role in Irish history, but it is also important to consider the social, political, and economic context within which they worked. While de Valera's comments about Collins in 1966 have been partially corroborated by historiography, it is clear that both men played a crucial role in the fight for Irish independence and the establishment of the Irish Free State. De Valera's legacy remains controversial, but it is worth considering whether his failure to be remembered in a positive light is due to political or social issues, rather than to any failure on his part to achieve successes that should make him more sympathetically remembered.
