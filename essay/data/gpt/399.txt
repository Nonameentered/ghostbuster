The concept of judicial review has been established to ensure that public bodies and officials act within the boundaries of their lawful powers. This is to prevent any kind of abuse of power and to protect people's interests. The procedural requirements for a claim for judicial review are multifarious, and the rules vary depending on the type of decision under review. In this essay, I will discuss the procedural requirements for a claim for judicial review and the grounds that X can use to challenge the school's decision to exclude him. I will also explore how the principle of proportionality applies to X's case and the rule against bias that potentially applies to Y's case.
Judicial review is a way to challenge a decision made by a public body or official. The procedural requirements for a claim for judicial review can be divided into two stages, initial and permission stage. At the initial stage, X should identify the decision and the grounds for challenging the decision. X should provide written notice to the relevant public body or official of the claim within three months of the decision being made. The notice must include specific information such as the grounds for the claim, the details of the decision under review, and the relief sought.
The grounds for the claim that X could use to challenge the school's decision to exclude him include illegality, irrationality, and procedural impropriety. The ground of illegality is concerned with decision-making powers and the limits of its exercise. The school's decision to exclude X may have been made outside of the powers available to the school or in violation of any legal requirement. For instance, if the school did not follow its own exclusion policy and did not give X the opportunity to be heard and explain his actions, it might amount to illegality. 
Irrationality is another ground for a claim for judicial review. This ground challenges the reasonableness of the decision made by the public body or official. X could use this ground if he believes that the school's decision to exclude him was unreasonable and based on incorrect facts or a flawed decision-making process. For example, if it can be proven that X's behavior was not severe enough to warrant exclusion or that the school did not consider any mitigating factors, there may be grounds for a claim of irrationality.
Finally, procedural impropriety can be used as a ground for the claim. This ground relates to the procedures used by the public body or official and whether they followed the correct procedures in reaching the decision. X could use this ground if the school did not follow the correct procedures or if he was not given a fair hearing before the decision to exclude him was made. For instance, if the panel who decided his case was biased, it could constitute a ground for procedural impropriety. 
The principle of proportionality is essential to determining whether a decision is reasonable. It involves balancing the benefits of a decision against the harm it might cause. In X's case, the principle of proportionality would be applied to determine whether the school's decision to exclude him was proportionate to the offense committed. For example, if X's misbehavior was not severe or if he could be rehabilitated through alternative means, the school's decision to exclude him might be considered disproportionate. The court would examine whether other options such as suspension, counseling, or mediation could have been used instead of exclusion.
Another rule relevant to X's case is the rule against bias. This rule requires decision-makers to be impartial and not have any preconceived notions. Bias is a threat to the fundamental principle of fair decision-making. In X's case, if the panel who decided his case had already formed an opinion about X's behavior before the hearing, it could constitute bias. X could challenge the decision on the basis of bias and claim that the panel was not impartial, which is a violation of his right to a fair trial.
In conclusion, a claim for judicial review operates as a check on the power of public bodies and officials to ensure that they act within the boundaries of their lawful powers. The procedural requirements for a claim for judicial review are multifarious, and the grounds for a claim include illegality, irrationality, and procedural impropriety. The principle of proportionality is the fundamental principle in determining whether a decision is reasonable, and the rule against bias ensures that decision-makers are impartial. X could use the grounds of illegality, irrationality, and procedural impropriety to challenge the school's decision to exclude him. Moreover, the principle of proportionality could be applied to determine whether the decision to exclude X was proportionate, and the rule against bias would ensure that he receives a fair trial.
