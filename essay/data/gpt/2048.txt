The International Service for National Agricultural Research (ISNAR) was a semi-autonomous organization established in 1975 as a research and capacity-building entity for agricultural research in developing countries. From 1975 until its closure in 2004, ISNAR focused on the development of national agricultural research systems (NARS) and provided them with technical assistance, training, and management tools. However, changes in the global agricultural landscape and the increasing importance placed on market-oriented research impacted ISNAR’s operations. The organization faced numerous challenges in the 2000s that influenced its goals and activities, including external market interactions and individual goals and interests. This essay will explore the goals, structure, and culture of ISNAR during 2001-2004, including the restructuring phase and closure, and how external market interactions, individual goals, and interests influenced the organization’s goals and activities. 
Goals and activities of ISNAR
ISNAR was established with the goal of supporting and strengthening national agricultural research systems of developing countries. The organization acted as an intermediary and facilitator between donors, NARS, and other stakeholders with the aim of improving the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of agricultural research. ISNAR supported NARS through the provision of technical assistance, capacity building, and information-sharing. The organization also conducted research on the organization and management of national agricultural research systems. 
ISNAR’s activities were aligned with these goals. The organization provided assistance to NARS in areas such as strategic planning, research management, human resource development, and information management. Through its research activities, ISNAR aimed to identify best practices in the management of agricultural research systems. ISNAR’s activities were intended to improve the quality and relevance of agricultural research in developing countries, thus contributing to poverty reduction and food security.
ISNAR’s restructuring
In the early 2000s, ISNAR faced a number of challenges that led to a restructuring of the organization. One of the primary challenges was changes in the global agricultural research landscape. There was a growing emphasis on market-oriented research, with funding being increasingly allocated to research that was seen as having commercial potential. This shift in funding priorities impacted the focus of ISNAR’s activities. The organization shifted its focus towards supporting NARS in conducting research that had market potential. 
Another challenge faced by ISNAR was a reduction in donor funding. Donors began to move away from funding long-term institutional capacity-building and towards funding short-term, project-based activities. As a result, ISNAR’s funding base was eroded, and the organization struggled to maintain its operations. 
In response to these challenges, ISNAR initiated a restructuring process in 2002. The restructuring involved the consolidation of ISNAR’s operations with those of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The aim was to create a new entity that would be better positioned to respond to the changing global agricultural research landscape and address the challenges faced by ISNAR. 
Impacts of external market interactions on ISNAR’s survival
The shift towards market-oriented research had a significant impact on ISNAR’s survival. The organization was established with a mandate to support national agricultural research systems in developing countries. However, changes in the funding landscape resulted in a shift away from supporting NARS towards supporting research that had commercial potential. This shift in focus created a misalignment between ISNAR’s mandate and its funding base. 
ISNAR’s survival was also impacted by a reduction in donor funding. The move away from long-term institutional capacity building towards short-term project-based activities eroded ISNAR’s funding base, making it difficult for the organization to maintain its operations. 
Individual goals and interests within ISNAR
Individual goals and interests also had an impact on ISNAR’s goals and activities. The organization was staffed by individuals with diverse backgrounds and interests. Staff members had varying levels of commitment to ISNAR’s mandate and mission. This diversity of interests and goals influenced the goals and activities of ISNAR. 
In addition to individual goals, institutional goals also influenced the goals and activities of ISNAR. Institutional goals were shaped by the priorities of the organization’s leadership. The leadership of ISNAR had a significant influence on the organization’s goals and activities. 
In some cases, individual goals and institutional goals were aligned. Staff members who were committed to ISNAR’s mandate and mission worked towards achieving the organization’s goals. However, in other cases, individual goals and institutional goals were not aligned. Staff members who were less committed to ISNAR’s mandate and mission worked towards achieving their own goals, which were not necessarily aligned with the organization’s goals. 
Conclusion
ISNAR’s restructuring highlights the impact of external market interactions on the goals and activities of organizations. The shift towards market-oriented research had a significant impact on the survival of ISNAR. The reduction in donor funding and move towards short-term project-based activities also impacted the organization’s survival. Individual goals and interests also had an impact on ISNAR’s goals and activities, with some staff members working towards achieving the organization’s goals and others working towards achieving their own goals. The restructuring of ISNAR provides insight into the effectiveness of organizations and their relationship to human behaviour. It highlights the need for organizations to adapt to changes in the external environment while maintaining alignment between institutional goals and individual goals.
