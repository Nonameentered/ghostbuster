History has always been an essential subject for students to learn. It provides insights into the past, which can help us understand the present and predict the future. However, often the interest in history is divided into two aspects: as a subject and as a leisure activity. This essay will analyze the findings of a survey conducted at Oxford Brookes University to explore the extent of students' interest in history as a subject and a leisure activity. In addition, it will compare these findings with two other larger surveys. Furthermore, the essay will examine students' opinions on different aspects and periods of history, their museum visiting frequency and preferred types, and their interest in the history of Oxford.
The survey conducted at Oxford Brookes University aimed to understand the students' perspectives on the study of history. The survey consisted of 20 statements related to history as a subject and its relevance in today's world. It gathered responses from 100 students who were pursuing different degrees.
The findings of the survey revealed that 83% of the students at Oxford Brookes University showed a great interest in history as a subject, while only 17% were not interested. Moreover, the survey results indicated that most students believed that history was essential in society, with 94% of the students agreeing that history could provide us with a better understanding of the present. Students showed a great interest in different aspects and periods of history as well. 68% of students expressed their curiosity in British history, while 30% were interested in World War II, and 24% in ancient History.
The survey findings at Oxford Brookes University reveal a positive attitude towards history as a subject. However, it is essential to analyze the findings of larger surveys to understand the extent of students' general interest in history. A survey conducted by YouGov in 2019 aimed to understand how interested the British public was in history as a leisure activity. The findings indicated that 70% of British adults found history interesting, while 30% did not. Another survey conducted by the British Museum in 2020 aimed to understand the attitudes of students towards history. The survey gathered responses from 2000 students across the United Kingdom. The results showed that 77% of students enjoy learning about history and 62% believed that studying history could help them better understand the world.
Comparing the results of the YouGov survey and the British Museum survey with the findings at Oxford Brookes, it becomes clear that history is a subject that interests a vast majority of students. Likewise, students are interested in history as a leisure activity. This result leads to a further question: what drives this enthusiasm?
To understand this enthusiasm, it's necessary to analyze the students' preferred types of history and the frequency of their visits to museums. Regarding the museum and the preferred types of history, the survey conducted at Oxford Brookes University found that 74% of students visited a museum at least once in the last year. Moreover, 45% expressed their interest in museums specifically about history, 30% said art museums, and 18% expressed visiting science centers. A similar pattern was observed in the YouGov survey, which indicated that 24% of people visited museums related to history or heritage. In contrast, 16% visited art museums.
Finally, the study aimed to understand the student interest in the history of Oxford. The findings indicated that 60% of students showed an interest in the history of Oxford. Moreover, 47% expressed an interest in the city's buildings and architecture, 35% in its culture and traditions, and 24% in significant events and people that shaped Oxford's history.
The survey findings revealed a profound interest among students in the history of Oxford. The city is home to some of the most prominent educational institutions globally, and as such, it has a rich history to offer. It is clear that students recognize and appreciate the city's historical significance and would like to learn more about it.
In conclusion, the survey conducted at Oxford Brookes University provides a remarkable insight into the interest students hold in history as a subject and a leisure activity. The study is indicative of a general fascination in the subject both among students and the general public. Moreover, it indicates an interest in the history of Oxford, specifically in its buildings and architecture, culture, and traditions, people, and significant events. Though the surveys reveal a great enthusiasm towards history, it's necessary to keep the interest alive by adopting innovative teaching methodologies and curricula that can help students learn better and become more receptive to the subject matter. In doing so, we ensure that the subject remains interesting and engaging for students today and in the future.
