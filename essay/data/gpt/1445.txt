In the world of Victorian literature, the trope of the "fallen woman" was a popular subject for discussion. Two prominent examples of this trope can be found in George Moore's novel "Esther Waters" and Thomas Hardy's "Tess of the D'Urbervilles". In both works, the titular women experience similar plot circumstances as single mothers and fallen women, yet their treatment and eventual fates differ. This essay will compare the portrayal of Esther and Tess and consider the factors that contribute to the different consequences faced by the two heroines.
One of the primary differences between the two heroines is the way they are presented to the reader. In "Tess of the D'Urbervilles", Tess is the central figure of the narrative. Much of the book is dedicated to her inner thoughts and feelings, as well as the external factors that shape her experiences. Tess is presented as an innocent victim, a woman who is punished for the sins of others. On the other hand, "Esther Waters" is largely focused on the social and political issues related to poverty and the working classes. While Esther is indeed a complex and sympathetic character, the book often feels more like a treatise on social issues than a novel about an individual's experiences.
However, despite their differing narrative styles, the two heroines share several similarities. Both Tess and Esther are young, virtuous women who experience terrible tragedies that leave them pregnant and alone. Both women are forced to take on menial jobs to make ends meet and struggle to provide for their children. Both women are also vulnerable to the predatory behavior of men, and both endure a great deal of suffering due to this vulnerability.
Despite their similarities, however, the two heroines face very different consequences for their actions. In "Tess of the D'Urbervilles", Tess is ultimately punished for her "moral" transgressions. The final chapters of the book are filled with heavy religious symbolism, and Tess herself is presented as a Christ-like figure, ultimately martyred for her sins. In contrast, Esther Waters manages to build a new life for herself and her child. While she is never fully accepted by society, she finds a new family and a sense of purpose that ultimately help her to find happiness.
So what factors contribute to these very different outcomes? One possible explanation is related to the social context surrounding the two novels. "Tess of the D'Urbervilles" was published in 1891, at a time when attitudes towards women and sexuality were becoming more repressive. Ideas of respectability and "moral purity" were becoming increasingly important, and the idea of the "fallen woman" as a social outcast was gaining traction. As a result, Hardy's portrayal of Tess as a victim was an attempt to challenge these attitudes and present a sympathetic picture of a woman who had been victimized by society.
"Esther Waters", on the other hand, was published in 1894, a time when attitudes towards the working classes were also beginning to change. The novel was one of the first to explore the experiences of a working-class woman in detail, and it presented a nuanced picture of the issues facing women like Esther. However, Moore's ultimate message seems to be one of optimism rather than despair. He presents Esther as a woman who is able to overcome her circumstances through her own hard work, determination, and resilience. 
Another possible explanation for the different outcomes faced by Esther and Tess relates to their respective authors' attitudes towards love and relationships. In "Tess of the D'Urbervilles", Hardy seems to be arguing that romantic love is ultimately destructive and can only lead to pain and suffering. Tess's relationships with both Alec and Angel bring her only misery, and ultimately lead to her downfall. In contrast, "Esther Waters" presents a more optimistic view of love. While Esther certainly experiences her fair share of heartbreak and betrayal, she is ultimately able to find happiness with her childhood sweetheart, William Latch. Moore seems to be arguing that love and companionship can provide a sense of purpose and meaning in an otherwise difficult and painful world.
In conclusion, the portrayals of Esther and Tess in "Esther Waters" and "Tess of the D'Urbervilles" represent two very different approaches to the fallen woman trope. While both heroines experience similar plot circumstances as single mothers and fallen women, their treatment and eventual fates differ significantly. The factors that contribute to these differences are complex and multifaceted, but they speak to the wider social and cultural context in which the novels were produced, as well as the authors' attitudes towards love, relationships, and the role of women in society. Ultimately, both novels provide valuable insights into the experiences of women in Victorian England, and continue to be relevant and powerful works of literature today.
