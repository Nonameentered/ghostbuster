Design and implementation are two critical aspects of any project. Designing a project involves planning and drafting procedures that are carried out in the project. Implementation is all about executing the plan to the best of its ability. In some cases, itâ€™s better to run the design and implementation in parallel. The project team may decide to do so due to several factors. This essay will explain the same.
Several factors influenced the decision to run design and implementation in parallel for part two of the project. First, running design and implementation in parallel is an efficient way to complete the project quickly. When both aspects are carried out simultaneously, the implementation team can begin to execute their tasks as design progresses. This method eliminates lag time between design and implementation stages, which would otherwise slow down the process.
Second, running design and implementation in parallel allows for flexibility in case there are changes in the project's scope. Design changes can be incorporated in the implementation phase, thereby saving time and reducing the project's cost.
Third, time constraints were another factor. In some cases, projects come with strict timelines. Running design and implementation in parallel would make sense in such a scenario, especially in the case of large projects with several phases.
Once the team decided to run design and implementation in parallel, they needed to ensure that the team's effort and schedule redistribution were managed accordingly. One of the ways of managing the team's effort was to identify critical tasks that required immediate attention, ensuring that they had enough resources to complete them. It's crucial to have a well-defined and documented project plan, which specifies the project's objectives, timelines, and resources to be allocated. This will enable the team to manage their time and allocate resources according to the project's demands.
Efficient project management tools such as scheduling software could be used to keep track of the time, effort, and resources allocated to the various tasks. By utilizing such software, the project manager can identify areas where there may be a bottleneck and address them accordingly.
In conclusion, running design and implementation in parallel is a feasible approach to completing projects. It's essential to consider the factors that influence this decision, mainly the project's timeline, flexibility, and efficiency. Once the team decides to go this route, it's crucial to manage the team's effort and schedule redistribution effectively. With the right project management strategies and tools in place, the team can complete their tasks efficiently, delivering a successful project within the desired timeline.
