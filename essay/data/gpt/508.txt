Over the years, the furniture industry has become increasingly competitive and customer preferences have also evolved, with demands for affordability, convenience and quality. This evolving demand has shifted manufacturers' priorities to meet these demands and remain competitive. One of the standout contemporary companies that have successfully integrated and retained its unique position in the furniture industry is IKEA. IKEA has set itself apart by providing low-cost, high-quality furnishings as opposed to traditional competitors who provide bespoke, high-quality furnishings. This essay will examine IKEA's performance objectives in comparison to traditional competitors, evaluate IKEA's strategy of providing low-cost, high-quality furnishings and the traditional competitors' strategy of providing bespoke, high-quality furnishings, and also highlight the performance objectives that are highlighted by Slack et al. It will also provide an assessment of how IKEA performs in each objective in comparison to its traditional competitors.
Ikea is a unique furniture manufacturing company that has utilized customer-centric strategies to remain competitive in the ever-expanding furniture market. One of its most prominent strategies is providing affordable, high-quality furnishings. This is in contrast to traditional competitors who prioritize the creation of bespoke, high-quality furniture of premium prices. This approach of IKEA has revolutionized the industry and has led traditional competitors to incorporate some of its strategies themselves. For instance, traditional competitors have begun to provide affordable, pre-made furniture. However, compared to IKEA, their range of products and the degree of affordability has yet to meet the standard set by the manufacturing giant.
Ikea maintains its position by consistently adhering to its performance objectives. These objectives revolve around achieving operational efficiency, flexibility, quality, and innovation. These objectives are vital to the survival of Ikea as they enable the company to stay ahead of competitors, meet consumer demands, and minimize production costs. In terms of operational efficiency, Ikea's objective is to obtain reduced production costs without leaving a negative impact on the quality of their products. To achieve this, Ikea employs a flat-pack system of furniture manufacturing. The flat-pack system allows them to distribute furniture in a more cost-effective manner, reducing transportation expenses and minimizing storage space requirements. This approach has made Ikea an affordable option for consumers while minimizing production costs.
Flexibility is another performance objective that has allowed Ikea to stand out among competitors. They utilize a modular approach that enables customers to customize their purchases to meet their desired needs. This has enhanced customers' experience, as different customers' unique preferences can be incorporated into their purchases. This approach allows Ikea to achieve maximum flexibility while still meeting the production objectives of a high volume of standardized products.
Quality is another crucial performance objective that accentuates Ikea's strategy of providing low-cost, high-quality furnishings. Despite the low prices, the quality of their products is held to a high standard, ensuring that customers receive optimal value for the products they purchase. Ikea achieves its quality goals by incorporating practicality, efficiency, and environmental sustainability in its products. By prioritizing quality, Ikea has earned the trust of consumers and has become a household name for many.
Innovation is another important objective that has allowed Ikea to continuously evolve and remain competitive. With the rapidly changing consumer needs, Ikea has excelled in this objective by consistently incorporating new designs, materials, and concepts in their products. This approach has diversified its product range, securing a broader customer base and appealing to the modern and eclectic taste of its customers. For example, the concept of modularity and customization in Ikea's products allow customers to change the look of their products based on their preferences, making them feel more involved in product creation. In comparison, traditional competitors who offer high-end, bespoke furniture prioritize maintaining their conventional design and materials.
To compare Ikea's performance objectives with traditional competitors, it is relevant to evaluate how performance objectives are defined in the industry. Slack et al. (2017) outlined these objectives that incorporate cost, quality, flexibility, delivery speed, and innovation.
First, in cost, Ikea's low-cost, high-quality furniture embodies the cost objective, as their products are affordable, despite their value. The company has incorporated the elements of value engineering to minimize production costs, and then meet consumer tastes and preferences. In contrast, traditional competitors prioritize premium prices due to the customization and added costs associated with bespoke furniture.
Second, in quality, both the traditional and Ikea brands prioritize quality. However, in terms of Ikea's approach, quality is not compromised despite the competitive prices. In comparison, traditional competitors offer quality assurance in tandem with their premium prices due to the use of high-end materials and conforming to customers' bespoke needs.
Third, flexibility is increasingly becoming a priority in the industry, with customer needs tending towards customized goods. While traditional competitors provide customization solutions towards high-end furniture, Ikea incorporates the flat-pack system and modularity. This approach allows them to offer customizable solutions to meet the ever-changing consumer preferences.
Fourth, delivery speed is another performance objective that most competitors do not prioritize, yet consumers see it as a crucial aspect of furniture delivery. Both Ikea and traditional competitors offer delivery services, although Ikea's flat-pack system facilitates distribution and reduces transportation expenses, allowing them to offer low delivery rates in some cases.
Fifth, innovation is increasingly necessary to stay ahead of the competition, and Ikea is a frontrunner in this aspect. Ikea consistently incorporates new elements such as modular designs, diversity in materials, and product catalogs. In contrast, traditional competitors have not been quick to adopt such innovation, instead opting for conventional designs and materials.
In conclusion, Ikea's performance objectives have allowed it to thrive in a highly competitive and evolving furniture industry. Its approach towards affordability and sustainability while still prioritizing quality has become an integral avenue for success in the industry. The modularity and customization approach to product design continue to attract new customers and retain the old ones, reinforcing Ikea's brand reputation further. Their flexibility enables them to remain relevant while meeting consumers' demands while reducing production costs, the utilitarian flat-pack system has enhanced Ikea's operational efficiency, which is an integral aspect of competitiveness. Traditional competitors have taken notice of such strategies. Still, they have not been able to offer the same degree of affordability and convenience that industrial giant Ikea provides. Overall, Ikea's success is characterized by adherence to its unique performance objectives as outlined by Slack et al., which subsequently distinguishes the brand in the face of competitive forces.
