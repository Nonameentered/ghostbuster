Thomas Hobbes and John Locke are two renowned 17th-century philosophers who differ in their views on human nature, the state of nature, and social contract theory. Hobbes and Locke directly influenced modern theories on government and the role of individuals, communities, and leaders within society. Their conflicting beliefs on the state of nature would ultimately shape their later philosophical ideas. In this essay, we will compare and contrast Hobbes and Locke’s views on the state of nature, how their differing views shape their later philosophical ideas, and how such ideas continue to influence modern discourse.
Hobbes believed that the state of nature was a state of constant war and anarchy. Individuals were in a perpetual state of conflict, and the absence of authority led to violence, chaos, and fear. Hobbes famously stated that “the life of man [was] solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short” in the state of nature. He believed that human beings were inherently egoistic and driven by self-interest. For Hobbes, the natural state of human beings was not social or cooperative, but rather selfish and aggressive.
In contrast, Locke’s views on the state of nature were quite different. According to Locke, the state of nature did not necessarily depict a state of war; rather, it was a state of perfect freedom and natural law. Individuals were free to pursue their own interests and to choose how to live their lives. In Locke’s view, humans were basically good and moral, possessing inherent rights to life, liberty, and property. Locke believed that communities and governments are subsequently formed to protect these basic rights and to ensure that people live together in peace and harmony.
Hobbes and Locke’s differing views on the state of nature had a great impact on their later philosophical ideas. For Hobbes, the state of nature motivated his theory of the absolute sovereignty of a ruler. According to Hobbes, the solution to the chaos and violence of the state of nature was the creation of an all-powerful sovereign, or “Leviathan,” to bring order and stability to society. The sovereign’s power was not subject to limitations and individuals relinquished their rights to the state in exchange for protection and security.
On the other hand, Locke’s view of the state of nature shaped his idea of a social contract between the leaders and the people. According to Locke, the state of nature created the basis for individuals to transfer some of their innate rights to pursue safety and security in a ordered society. Governments thus are put in place to protect the natural rights of the people, and they are accountable to the people and can be removed if they violate their commitments. In contrast to Hobbes, Locke emphasised the importance of individual rights and political liberties.
The contrasting views of Hobbes and Locke on the state of nature continue to influence modern political and social debates. The theory of the Leviathan still has its appeal, and some modern-day political leaders and authoritarian regimes refer to its ideas. For instance, North Korea, a totalitarian regime, exercises an all-encompassing state control and has no political opposition. In contrast, the philosophy of Locke continues to shape modern democracies. Most democracies today are based on the principles he propounded, with emphasis on reciprocity between the government and its citizens.
In Hobbes’ view, tyranny by a sovereign was not justifiable, with the authority to maintain order based solely on fear of punishment in case of disobedience. For Hobbes, citizens did not have the right to revolt against an unjust ruler since the Leviathan maintained order in society, and anarchy would eventually prevail. Thus, for Hobbes, a strong leader was necessary to prevent the state of nature’s tyranny from realising. However, Locke believed that overthrowing an unjust ruler was not only reasonable but also a responsibility for citizens. Locke recognised the inconvenience of an unjust leader and states that it was the right of citizens to dispose of such leadership. Locke’s ideas suggest that people, under a social contract, are accountable to one another. Citizens reserve the right to abandon a government that limits the citizen’s natural rights in Locke’s social contract.
In conclusion, Hobbes and Locke held opposing views on human nature and the state of nature. Hobbes believed that humans were inherently egoistic and aggressive, and their natural state was chaotic and violent. For this reason, he advocated for a powerful and absolute ruler to bring order and stability to society. Locke disagreed with Hobbes and claimed that humans were inherently moral and good, and their natural state was peaceful and harmonious. According to Locke, the government was created to protect the rights of individuals and to ensure social order and justice. 
Similarly, Hobbes and Locke’s views on the state of nature had a significant impact on their later philosophical ideas, particularly on social and political theory. Hobbes’ concept of Leviathan emphasised the importance of authoritarian governance, whereas Locke’s social contract theory put emphasis on individual rights and political liberties. In modern democracies, Locke’s ideas have been more influential than Hobbes’ because it stresses the importance of social accountability and the protection of individual rights. This essay illuminates the significance of Hobbes and Locke’s philosophical ideas and how they differ based on their opinions of the state of nature.
