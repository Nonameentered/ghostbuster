Viscosity is a property that determines the internal resistance of a fluid to flow and is an essential physical parameter used to understand the behavior of liquids. The apparent viscosity of three different samples, evaporated milk, tomato soup, and custard, is a vital parameter to determine their nature and determine their probable applications. In this context, an evaluation of apparent viscosity for these three samples concerning changes in speed and non-Newtonian behavior can provide valuable insights into their behavior.
The first sample under consideration is evaporated milk. Evaporated milk, also known as unsweetened condensed milk, is a form of milk with a creamy texture and a sweetened taste. At rest, the fluid appears to be relatively viscous, suggesting that it might be a non-Newtonian fluid. However, when subjected to a torque, evaporated milk exhibits a linear relationship between shear stress and the measured velocity gradient, suggesting it is a Newtonian fluid. The observed linear relationship indicates that apparent viscosity does not change with changes in shear rate. Therefore, evaporated milk is a Newtonian fluid.
The second sample under consideration is tomato soup. Tomato soup is a widely consumed food that exhibits a relatively low viscosity, suggesting that it might be a Newtonian fluid. However, as shear rate changes, there is an observable change in the apparent viscosity of tomato soup. Such behavior points towards the sample being a non-Newtonian fluid. An increase in shear rate leads to a decrease in apparent viscosity, indicating that tomato soup is a shear-thinning fluid. The reduction in apparent viscosity implies that an increase in shear rate reduces the internal resistance of the fluid to flow.
The third sample under consideration is custard. Custard is a creamy dessert with a viscous texture that exhibits non-Newtonian behavior. At rest, the fluid appears to have a high apparent viscosity, suggesting that it might be a non-Newtonian fluid. When subjected to a shear rate, the apparent viscosity decreases with an increase in shear rate, indicating that custard is a shear-thinning fluid. The drop in apparent viscosity denotes that an increase in shear rate reduces the internal resistance to flow of the custard.
Concerning the changes in apparent viscosity concerning an increase or decrease in speed, it is clear that only tomato soup and custard exhibit such behavior. For tomato soup, an increase in shear rate leads to a reduction in the apparent viscosity of the fluid, while a decrease in shear rate results in an increase in apparent viscosity. Such a relationship indicates that tomato soup is a shear-thinning fluid, and as such, the internal resistance to flow decreases with an increase in shear rate, and vice versa.
Similarly, custard exhibits a similar trend in changes in apparent viscosity with an increase or decrease in speed. As the shear rate increases, the apparent viscosity of the custard decreases, while a decrease in shear rate increases the apparent viscosity. The observed behavior suggests that custard is a shear-thinning fluid, and changes in shear rate significantly impact how the fluid flows.
In conclusion, the apparent viscosity of three different fluids, evaporated milk, tomato soup, and custard, has been evaluated in this essay. The behavior of the fluids concerning changes in shear rate suggest that they exhibit different types of fluid behavior. Evaporated milk exhibits linear behavior, and changes in shear rate do not impact the internal resistance to flow of the fluid. Tomato soup and custard, on the other hand, exhibit shear-thinning behavior where the internal resistance to flow decreases with an increase in shear rate. Therefore, understanding the viscosity profile of fluids is essential in selecting fluids for specific applications where their behavior and properties are crucial in the function and operation of the system.
