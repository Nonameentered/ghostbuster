Plato, the ancient Greek philosopher, is known for his works that were dedicated to exploring several aspects of human life, including politics, morality, and social issues, among others. In his book Republic, Plato formed an analogy between justice in the city and the soul, arguing that it is an inherent human desire to be just. The analogy establishes a connection between the political and personal aspects of society and indicates that justice is essential for a functional community. In this essay, I will examine Plato's analogy of justice in the city and the soul and analyze how he uses it to argue that it is in our interest to be just.
Plato evaluates the concept of justice by analyzing it at the societal and individual level, and he connects them with an analogy between the city and the soul. In his view, a universal concept of justice exists that applies to both the individual and society. To explain this connection, Plato uses the analogy where the healthy and just society is equivalent to a healthy and just soul. He believed that justice is a virtue that begins in the individual's soul and then extends into the community, resulting in harmony and stability.
According to Plato, every city requires a just ruler who can establish order in the society, and the ruler needs to exhibit virtues such as wisdom, courage, self-control, and justice. In the same way, he recognized that every individual's soul also requires these virtues to achieve inner peace and order. Plato suggests that the individual soul can be divided into three parts, namely, rational, spirited, and appetitive. Each part has distinct functions, and the balance amongst them is crucial in effectively carrying out the tasks of individuals. For instance, reason utters decisions, the spirit acts as a guardian, and desires regulate the biological functioning. Thus, Plato argued that if these elements are in accordance with each other, it will lead to harmony and justice. Consequently, he states that a just individual develops into a just society and vice versa.
Plato's analogy establishes a relationship between the inner workings of an individual's soul and the outer manifestations of society. He states that the elements of an individual's soul correspond to the three classes of a society, namely, rulers, soldiers, and workers. Just like the balanced and harmonious organization of an individual soul, a society should be balanced and harmonious, and perform its functions without conflict. For example, the ruling class is responsible for establishing laws and government, the soldiers are the protectors of the ruling government, and the workers who provide commodities and supplies to the society. A just society is one that has the precise distribution of functions, whereby each class should perform its assigned duty without infringing the other. As a result, this will lead to a stable, prosperous, and functional society.
Furthermore, Plato suggests that the lack of harmony in a society leads to the creation of unjust individuals. If the society is corrupt, the individuals within it will also be corrupt, and the unjust individuals will create conflict and disunity in society. In other words, society influences individual morality. Plato's view opposes the conventional assumptions that an individual's psyche is independent of society. Society influences an individual's thought and behavior by defining cultural norms and values. Individuals acquire behaviors while growing up, which are ingrained in their character, and it leads to their inclination towards specific causes.
Plato's analogy of the city and the soul emphasizes the importance of living in accordance with justice. The argument that it is in our interest to be just stems from the idea that both the individual and society function best when they are following the rules of justice. Plato presents his argument by using a symbolic representation of the human soul. In his analogy, the soul is compared to a city, where the individual elements of the soul represent different groups of people who play different roles in society. Through this approach, Plato emphasizes the importance of individual responsibilities in creating a harmonious society. He argues that the individual must work towards the greater good for the society to be successful as a whole.
Plato believed that justice is a virtue that must be pursued for its own sake, rather than for any potential rewards or benefits. He argues that if we strive to be just and cultivate this virtue, we will lead a meaningful and fulfilling life. In the same way, a city that values justice will achieve stability, peace, and prosperity. Plato highlights that being just does not necessarily mean that we will receive immediate benefits; rather, it is a long-term investment that will ultimately lead to a better life and a better society.
Moreover, Plato suggests that being just makes an individual closer to the divine virtue of goodness. According to Plato, the pursuit of justice leads to the attainment of pure knowledge and brings us closer to the divine. Therefore, the pursuit of knowledge and the pursuit of justice are similar in character. To seek knowledge is to strive towards the good, in the same way, the pursuit of justice leads us to the good life and a good society. Thus, Plato brings out this parallelism to emphasize his point that justice must be a priority.
To conclude, Plato's analogy of justice in the city and the soul establishes a connection between the political and personal aspects of society and indicates that justice is indispensable for a functional society. The analogy goes beyond the literal meaning of social organization as it provides an abstract insight into the principles that underlie moral and societal organization. For Plato, the pursuit of justice is considered an end in itself rather than a means to any particular end. Therefore, it is in our interest to be just, not because it leads only to material benefits, but because the pursuit of justice leads us to the good life, the virtuous life, a fulfilling life, and a harmonious and prosperous society. The notion that justice is crucial to the well-being of society has been echoed by several philosophers throughout history, making Plato's words a timeless reminder to prioritize the pursuit of justice.
