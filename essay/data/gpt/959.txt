The Downs model of voting, established by Anthony Downs in 1957, posits that voters behave rationally by casting their votes to maximize their utility. This model plays a crucial role in explaining the result of the General Election in 2005. In this essay, I intend to evaluate the extent to which the Downs model can be employed in explaining the outcome of the election.
The 2005 election was a crucial one that marked an end to the era of Tony Blair and the New Labour government after more than 13 years in power. The election that took place on the 5th of May 2005 saw the incumbent Labour Party led by Prime Minister Tony Blair seeking re-election, while their opposition, the Conservative Party led by Michael Howard, was vying to oust them from power. The election produced a victory for the Labour Party, who managed to win a third term in government, albeit with a reduced majority.
The Downsian model of voting theory predicts that when voters go to the polls, they cast their vote for the party that they believe will offer them the greatest benefit. According to Downs, voters are rational and act in their self-interest, where they try to maximize their gains while minimizing their costs. A rational voter understands that casting a vote is costly in terms of time and effort, and therefore, they will only vote if the expected benefit of doing so is higher than the expected cost. Consequently, this creates an incentive for political parties to appeal to the median voter, which is the voter who holds the greatest sway in determining the election's outcome.
The concept of the median voter is central to the Downsian model of voting, as it explains how political parties can capture the largest number of votes and win elections. In essence, this theory suggests that in a two-party system, political parties will strive to position themselves as close to the median voter's ideological preferences as possible. This is because the median voter holds the greatest power to sway the election. In other words, political parties have an incentive to position themselves near the center of the political spectrum to win the support of the largest number of voters.
In the 2005 General Election, the two main political parties in the UK, the Labour Party and the Conservative Party, exhibited this partisan behavior and attempted to appeal to the median voter. Labour Party, being the incumbent government, campaigned on a platform of economic prosperity, job creation, and maintaining stability. This strategy has been criticized for being too complacent and unimaginative, but it also managed to appeal to the median voter's concerns about job security, economic prosperity, and stability. On the other hand, the Conservative Party, led by Michael Howard, campaigned on a platform of reducing taxes, increasing spending on public services, and fighting crime. This strategy was an attempt to appeal to the median voter's concerns about taxation, public services, and law and order.
In the 2005 election, the Labour Party won with a reduced majority, securing 35.2% of the popular vote, while the Conservative Party garnered 32.3%, and the Liberal Democrats won 22%. This outcome could be interpreted through the lens of the Downs model of voting theory, as the Labour party was still able to win the election by positioning themselves slightly to the right of the political spectrum, where the median voter lies. The Labour Party's campaign recognized middle-class concerns, such as education, healthcare, and job security. At the same time, they portrayed the Conservatives as an elitist party, interested in protecting wealthy people's interests and increasing economic inequality. The Labour campaign also fueled anxiety around the lack of credibility of the Conservative leader, Michael Howard, by focusing on his right-wing views and previous record in government.
However, the outcome of the election was not entirely predictable through the Downsian model of voting theory. While the Labour party was successful in appealing to the median voter, it could be argued that the third party, the Liberal Democrats, also managed to influence the outcome by winning 22% of the vote, largely by campaigning against Labour's decision to join the Iraq War. This demonstrates that political parties could win votes through challenging the dominant two parties, which could affect the predicted outcome based on the Downsian model of voting theory.
Furthermore, the results of the 2005 General Election revealed that other factors aside from the Downsian model could influence the election outcome. For example, the influence of events, such as the Iraq War and the 7/7 London attacks, could have played a factor in shifting the median voter's position, thereby affecting the election outcome. The Iraq War, in particular, was one of the most significant factors in the election, with many voters expressing their discontent with the government's decision to go to war in Iraq. Beyond this, tactical votings, in which voters cast their vote for parties they usually wouldn't to unseat an incumbent, could significantly impact the predicted outcome based on the Downs model. Finally, low voter turnout could significantly reduce the number of voters that could participate in the estimation of a median voter, which could prevent the Downs model from generating accurate results.
In conclusion, the Downs model of voting theory is an essential political science model for predicting election outcomes. This model provides an understanding of how voters behave when casting their votes, and how political parties can appeal to the median voter. However, while the model was useful in explaining the outcome of the 2005 General Election, it could not entirely predict the results due to the influence of other factors, including the Iraq War, tactical voting, and low voter turnout. The Downs model of voting theory can, therefore, provide a guide, but it should not be treated as a definitive estimation of outcome, and election outcomes may still remain influenced by many other external factors.
