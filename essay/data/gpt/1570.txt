The nursing profession is built upon a foundation of evidence-based practice (EBP), which emphasizes the incorporation of the best available research evidence into clinical decision making. Research plays a crucial role in developing and refining the knowledge needed to enhance clinical practice in nursing. It helps practitioners to recognize and tackle the gaps in their practice, and it facilitates the identification of effective interventions to bridge these gaps. Qualitative research methods are an essential component of the nursing profession's research toolkit. Two studies that demonstrate the value of qualitative research in nursing include one that examines the stigma experienced by patients with lung cancer, and the other that evaluates the effectiveness of health promotion for adolescents in primary care.
To begin with, a qualitative study is a methodical approach that aims to investigate people's perceptions, behaviors, and experiences through inquiry, focus groups, and interviews. The study's focus is primarily on exploring the meaning behind individuals' experiences rather than quantifying data statistically. Qualitative research offers researchers the opportunity to capture participants' insights and experiences in-depth and explore the richness of human experiences.
In a qualitative study done by O'Hara et al. (2019), researchers explored the experiences of patients with lung cancer to identify the stigmatization they faced from healthcare professionals, other patients, and the public. The study aimed to provide insight into the lived experiences of patients with lung cancer and to explore the factors contributing to cancer stigma. Using a phenomenological design, researchers conducted in-depth interviews with 16 patients with different stages and types of lung cancer.
The results showed that patients with lung cancer experienced a range of negative attitudes and behaviors from healthcare professionals and the public. The participants spoke of the stigma associated with the perception that lung cancer is self-inflicted, caused by smoking, and therefore not worthy of treatment. Some participants reported being afraid to seek help because of the stigmatization that they expected to face. The study found that stigma from cancer diagnosis and treatment led to emotional distress, negative self-worth, and a lack of hope for recovery.
As a result of the qualitative study, healthcare providers can improve the quality of care they provide to patients with lung cancer by addressing the underlying factors contributing to cancer stigmatization. The study reveals that the stigma is multifaceted, and the healthcare workforce needs to recognize the diverse cultural beliefs and attitudes toward lung cancer to provide patient-centered care. The findings highlight the importance of providing education and awareness programs to address the multiple factors contributing to lung cancer stigma, emphasizing the importance of treating patients holistically instead of being limited by the beliefs about the cause of the disease.
Another example of a qualitative study that illustrates how research can refine knowledge and improve nursing practice is a study that examined the effectiveness of health promotion for adolescents in primary care. In a study by Oetzel et al. (2018), the researchers evaluated the implementation of a health promotion intervention for Indigenous and non-Indigenous adolescents in primary care in New Zealand. The study aimed to determine the factors that contributed to successful intervention implementation by exploring the experiences of the adolescents, healthcare providers, and community stakeholders involved in the program.
The results revealed that a successful intervention implementation is dependent on the healthcare providers' attitudes, the quality of the intervention design, and the ability to have ongoing support from the community stakeholders. Qualitative data collected through interviews revealed that the provider's attitudes were crucial in shaping the adolescent's willingness to engage in a health promotion intervention. The study found that while healthcare providers acknowledged the positive impact of health promotion, many of them had limited knowledge of how to deliver health promotion effectively for adolescents. The study also identified the importance of involving the community and engaging with them in the design and implementation of the health promotion intervention.
The study findings can be used to refine health promotion interventions for adolescents in primary care. The results highlight the importance of adequate support to providers to ensure they have the necessary skills and knowledge to deliver health promotion interventions effectively. Furthermore, the study recognizes the importance of recognizing the community's cultural beliefs and values in designing interventions that are culturally appropriate and acceptable.
In conclusion, the nursing profession places great importance on evidence-based practice, and research is a crucial component for developing and refining knowledge. Qualitative research methods, particularly, facilitate understanding and interpretation of human experiences, and enable the nursing profession to develop patient-centered care plans. This essay has examined two studies that demonstrate the value of qualitative research in refining knowledge in the nursing profession, particularly in improving clinical practice. The research studies provide insights into the factors that contribute to successful intervention implementation while highlighting the importance of recognizing patient's culture and beliefs. By incorporating these findings, nursing practice can be more effective, and patient outcomes are likely to be improved.
