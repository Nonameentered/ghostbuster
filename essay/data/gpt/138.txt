Free indirect discourse is a narrative technique that allows writers to convey the thoughts and emotions of the characters without using direct quotes or attributions. This technique blends the voice of the narrator with that of the character, making it difficult for the reader to distinguish between the two. Gustave Flaubert, the French author, is often praised for his effective use of free indirect discourse in his novel, Madame Bovary.
Madame Bovary tells the story of Emma, a young woman who marries a doctor, Charles Bovary, but feels trapped in a loveless marriage. Emma turns to extramarital affairs and materialistic desires to escape her dissatisfaction with her life. Flaubert uses free indirect discourse to explore Emma's inner thoughts and emotions while maintaining a seemingly objective narrative.
In the novel, Flaubert often employs free indirect discourse to create a sympathetic connection between the reader and Emma. For instance, when Emma first meets her future husband Charles, Flaubert uses free indirect discourse to convey a sense of Emma's disdain towards him. The narrator states, "She would have preferred someone else, a young man with blond hair with a pale, distinguished face. She was all right with the widower, but married men disgusted her." The reader feels disgusted along with Emma, and as a result, is more likely to sympathize with her later actions, including her extramarital affairs.
Flaubert also uses free indirect discourse to convey Emma's complex emotions of love, depression, and regret. In the early part of the novel, Emma feels trapped by her marriage to Charles and dreams of a life of luxury and adventure. Flaubert writes, "She was going to seek what? Happiness, passion, riches? She had not formulated any definite plan, but she was fully aware that her present life was intolerable." The use of free indirect discourse here allows the reader to understand Emma's inner turmoil and the intense longing she feels for a life that she believes she deserves.
Moreover, Flaubert's use of free indirect discourse in Madame Bovary enables the reader to see the novel's other characters in a more nuanced light. For example, in a scene where Emma's lover, Rodolphe, is trying to break up with her, Flaubert uses free indirect discourse to reveal Rodolphe's true motives. The narration states, "He thought it would be easy to make up with her later on. Besides, she had played the game of offended virtue and chased him away. That was the very thing he had wanted, and now he felt angry with her." The blended narration here doesn't just tell readers what happened but offers insight into Rodolphe's personality, which informs his future decisions.
Besides, Flaubert's use of free indirect discourse in Madame Bovary allows the reader to experience multiple characters' perspectives simultaneously. In the scene where Emma is dying, Flaubert uses free indirect discourse to immerse the reader in Emma's deteriorating mental state. As the narration states, "She felt the cold slowly seizing her from the feet up, and it was as if the cold expanded within her infinitely, as if the ice within her heart was spreading through her body." This connection between Emma's thoughts and bodily sensations allows the reader to feel Emma's pain and sadness as if it were their own.
In conclusion, Flaubert's use of free indirect discourse in Madame Bovary is a significant reason why the novel is widely considered a masterpiece. It's through this technique that Flaubert creates a sense of intimacy with the characters, allowing readers to experience their thoughts and emotions as if they were their own. The device simultaneously allows for an objective narrative and is therefore crucial in conveying the complexity of Flaubert's characters. By employing such technique, Flaubert created a modern novel that would influence and inspire future generations of writers.
