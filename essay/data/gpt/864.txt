Modern medicine has become an integral part of our society, where it is revered for its supposed healing powers, and its ability to save lives. However, despite its life-saving abilities, it is no longer just about the promotion of health. Rather, modern medicine has become a socially controlling institution in society. This comes in different forms that are primarily designed to shape and dictate behavior while promoting healing. In this essay, I will explore the various ways modern medicine has become socially controlling, and the different forms of social control that it exerts.
Modern medicine has become a socially controlling institution in society in several ways. It is no longer just about providing medical care and treatment but also about shaping the way society thinks, behaves, and interacts with one another. Much of this social control is exerted through the use of protocols, guidelines, and standards of care, which create standards that hospitals, clinics, and healthcare providers are expected to adhere to.
One of the main forms of social control that modern medicine exerts on society is medicalization. Medicalization involves the process of defining and treating social problems as medical problems. Here, medical professionals assert that they have the ability to address socially defined problems, for example, obesity and addiction, through medical intervention. The result of this intervention is to place significant emphasis on individual responsibility while masking underlying social and economic factors that are fueling these problems.
The pharmaceutical industry is another critical component of modern medicine that has contributed significantly to its growth as a socially controlling institution in society. Pharmaceutical companies use their resources to engage in aggressive marketing practices that create a culture of dependency on medication. They take advantage of the public's vulnerable and often desperate times to push drugs, whether they are needed or not. This has resulted in an overreliance on medication for physical and psychological conditions, with many people believing that drugs are the only solution to their health problems.
Another form of social control is medical surveillance. Medical surveillance is the process of observing populations systematically to identify, track, and intervene in cases of illness. It is often carried out by government agencies to monitor not only a person's immediate health but also their lifestyle habits. The information gathered through medical surveillance can be used as justification by law enforcement agencies to prosecute individuals. The imposition of mandatory vaccinations to prevent the spread of diseases like COVID-19 is an example of medical surveillance. However, the potential for abuse and misuse of medical surveillance data to control and manipulate social behavior is a real concern.
Modern medicine also controls society through bioethics and medical ethics. These are sets of guidelines that dictate acceptable behavior for patients, doctors, and researchers operating within the healthcare industry. These guidelines are often set and enforced by governments through regulatory bodies. They guide decision making, shape the behavior of healthcare professionals, and set standards for clinical practice. They are fundamental to the operation of modern medicine and ensure that patients receive safe and ethical care. However, at the same time, they can distort medical priorities, create disparities in the health field, and ultimately lead to systemic oppression.
The use of medical technology and advances in medical science have also played a crucial role in modern medicine's ability to exert social control. Advancements in medical technology have enabled doctors to observe and measure various aspects of a patient's health. These technological innovations have shifted the focus of medicine from the patient's symptoms to a numerical representation of their health. The use of machines and computers has altered the very nature and goal of medical practice, which is to heal the patient, to one of monitoring and statistical analysis.
Medical science has also advanced rapidly, and there is now a greater understanding of the biological and chemical processes within the body. However, these advances have led to the objectification of the body, where the patient is reduced to a set of symptoms and a collection of biochemical processes. This disregard for the individuality of patients has led to the standardization of treatment plans and has ignored the social and psychological factors that impact a person's health.
In conclusion, modern medicine has become a socially controlling institution in society through various forms of social control that dictate behavior and shape interactions between individuals. The use of protocols, guidelines, and standards of care, medicalization, the pharmaceutical industry, medical surveillance, bio and medical ethics and the use of medical technology and scientific advances have all contributed to the social control exerted by modern medicine. While it is essential to provide healthcare, there is a need to ensure that social control is not used to manipulate, oppress, or exploit individuals. This can be achieved by creating more inclusive and equitable health systems that prioritize the patient's individuality and social context while providing care.
