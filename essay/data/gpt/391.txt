Familial obligations and political obligations may appear to be two unrelated subjects, however, they share some fundamental similarities. Both involve duties and responsibilities that are expected to be fulfilled by the members of the family or society. Additionally, both familial and political obligations are a form of social contract that binds individuals to their respective roles. This essay will explore these similarities, examining how familial obligations are akin to political obligations.
Familial obligations refer to the duties and responsibilities that individuals have towards their families. Such duties include taking care of one's parents, spouses, children, and other relatives. While the scope of familial obligations may differ based on cultural practices and societal norms, they exist in various cultures worldwide. For instance, in most Asian cultures, parents are highly respected and are expected to be taken care of by their children, whereas in Western cultures, elderly parents are often sent to nursing homes. Moreover, familial obligations can also take the form of supporting other family members in times of need, providing emotional support and taking care of younger siblings.
Similarly, political obligations center around duties and responsibilities that are imposed on individuals that are a part of a political state. The state demands its citizens to respect the laws, pay taxes, and participate in democratic processes such as voting, and sometimes service in the military. In return, the state provides individuals with basic amenities such as security, hospitals, schools, fire protection, among others. Additionally, citizens also have political duties such as voicing dissent and holding the government accountable.
One of the fundamental similarities between familial and political obligations is that both involve a form of social contract. A social contract refers to an implicit agreement that individuals sign upon birth, explicitly or implicitly, to maintain order within a societal framework. While individuals may not remember or know the constitutions, bylaws, or cultural practices that define this contract, they have tacitly agreed to abide by them since birth. For example, familial obligations can be seen as a social contract since individuals are born with certain familial obligations, and that this contract is enforced by social norms and expectations. Similarly, political obligations are a social contract since citizens have implicitly agreed to abide by laws and participate in democratic processes when they are born into a political entity, whether they are aware of this agreement or not.
Another similarity between familial and political obligations is that they are both expected to be fulfilled regardless of individual choice. In the case of familial obligations, individuals are obligated to care for their family members, whether they want to or not. Even if some members in the family do not like one another, the expectation remains that they should still provide support to one another during their time of need. Similarly, political obligations are not optional; citizens are obligated to obey the laws and participate in the political processes. Even if they do not like political systems in place, they have a responsibility to contribute by paying taxes and respecting constitutions.
Additionally, familial and political obligations are based on a hierarchical or structural relationship. In a family or a political state, there is a clear hierarchy, with some members having more authority, power, or privileges than others. For instance, parents in a family have more authority compared to their children, and civil servants in a country have more authority than the ordinary citizens. This hierarchy gives rise to different expectations and responsibilities, which individuals are expected to comply with. For example, a father has the responsibility to provide for his children, and civil servants have the responsibility of ensuring that the state runs smoothly.
Furthermore, both familial and political obligations promote social cohesion and contribute to the maintenance of order within a society. Each of these obligations plays a crucial role in ensuring social stability. Family members are expected to provide support to each other, which helps maintain social bonds. Similarly, citizens are expected to obey laws and participate in political processes, which ensure that there is a mechanism in place to regulate the behavior of individuals within the society. 
Lastly, both familial and political obligations can involve sacrifices, sometimes at a personal level, for the greater good of the family or the society. For instance, a parent may have to sacrifice their financial resources or time to provide support to family members in need. Similarly, citizens may have to give up their comfort or safety to participate in community building processes such as volunteering, participating in protests, or even serving in the military.
In conclusion, familial and political obligations share some fundamental similarities. Both involve a social contract, have hierarchical or structural relationships, demand responsibilities and duties that individuals are expected to fulfill regardless of personal choice, facilitate social cohesion, and call for sacrifices for the greater good of the family or society. While familial and political obligations are different in some ways, such as the scale of the obligation and the scope of the duties involved, it is clear that they are both essential in maintaining order and stability in society. As such, it is critical for individuals to recognize and appreciate both familial and political obligations as they contribute to the overall well-being of the community.
