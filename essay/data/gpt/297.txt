In liberal theory, the concept of justice has been approached through a variety of perspectives. Robert Nozick and John Rawls have both contributed heavily to this discussion with their distinctive views. While both philosophers agree on the importance of justice in a society, their understandings of it differ significantly. Nozick's entitlement theory and Rawls' theory of justice demonstrate some crucial differences and implications for the wider community. Rawls presents his ideas through a thought experiment and proposes principles for a just society, which can be evaluated in terms of their adequacy in addressing the issue of relative poverty. Furthermore, Rawls' theory of justice has faced criticism from a communitarian perspective. This essay aims to compare and contrast Nozick and Rawls' theories on justice within liberal theory, highlight the difference in their conceptions of justice, and evaluate their theories' implications in society.
Firstly, it is essential to acknowledge the fundamental difference in the conception of justice between Nozick and Rawls. Nozick, in his Entitlement Theory, focuses on the acquisition and transfer of wealth as the central element of justice. Nozick believes that individuals are entitled to the property they obtain through voluntary exchange, gifts, or inheritance, and any redistribution of resources would violate their natural rights. On the other hand, Rawls's theory of justice emphasizes the distribution of resources within a society as a key element of justice. Rawls aims to ensure that social and economic inequalities in a society are structured in such a way that they benefit the least advantaged members of society. Therefore, while Nozick believes that justice involves the protection of private property rights, Rawls considers the distribution of resources and equal opportunities in a society to be central to justice.
One of the important implications of Nozick's Entitlement Theory is his justification of the distribution of wealth. Nozick argues that if individuals acquire their wealth lawfully, then they are entitled to it, and any attempt to redistribute wealth by the state is a violation of individual rights. Nozick's theory justifies the existence of economic inequality, as he believes that any attempt to create a more equal society would result in governmental coercion. Nozick argues that 'redistributive taxation' violates the individual's right to property and can only be justified to fund the necessary services of the state, such as law and order. Nozick proposes minimal government intervention in economic affairs, and advocates for a laissez-faire capitalist system, characterised by free markets, individual rights, and a minimal welfare state.
In contrast, Rawls's theory of justice advocates for a more significant government intervention in economic affairs to reduce inequality and promote social justice. Rawls believes that individuals should have equal access to resources and opportunities, which would enable them to lead fulfilling lives. Rawls' 'Difference Principle' posits that social and economic inequalities are acceptable if and only if they are to the advantage of the least advantaged members of society. Therefore, Rawls proposes a redistribution of resources from the affluent members of society to the less affluent members. Rawls' theory can be seen as advocating for a social welfare state, reinforcing the government's responsibility to ensure social justice in society.
An important aspect of Rawls' theory of justice is his thought experiment known as the 'veil of ignorance.' Rawls asks individuals to consider what principles they would devise for distributing economic goods if they did not know their place in society. Rawls argues that when behind the 'veil of ignorance,' individuals would be reasonable and seek to ensure a fair distribution of resources in a society, as they are unaware of where they may fall in the social hierarchy. The 'veil of ignorance' is a way to ensure that Rawls' principles for a just society are impartial and fair.
Rawls proposes two principles of justice: the first is the 'Principle of Equal Basic Liberties,' which posits that each person should have an equal right to the most extensive set of liberties compatible with an equal set of liberties for others. The second principle is the 'Difference Principle' discussed earlier, which aims to ensure social and economic inequalities are structured to the advantage of those who are the least advantaged. Rawls' principles aim to ensure that institutions in society guarantee equal opportunities and fair outcomes for all members of society, which is the basis of social justice.
However, one of the criticisms of Rawls' theory is its adequacy in addressing the issue of relative poverty. Critics argue that Rawls' theory does not go far enough in addressing poverty, and that the 'Difference Principle' does not generate enough resources to support the less fortunate members of society adequately. Critics argue that Rawls focuses too much on individual rights and is too individualistic in his approach, which can lead to inequality and injustice towards some groups in society.
Furthermore, Rawls' theory has also faced criticism from a communitarian perspective. Communitarians argue that Rawls' approach is too dominated by individual rights and does not take into consideration the communal aspects of society. Communitarians argue that Rawls fails to account for the importance of cultural practices and traditions in a society, which they believe shape individuals' values and beliefs. Communitarians propose that Rawls' theory of justice should give importance to the community and acknowledge the role of tradition in shaping a just society.
In conclusion, Nozick and Rawls' theories of justice provide contrasting views on how to achieve a just society within liberal theory. While Nozick focuses on the acquisition and transfer of property rights, Rawls' theory emphasizes the distribution of resources and opportunities within a society. Nozick's Entitlement Theory justifies economic inequality while Rawls' theory of justice aims to reduce inequality and promote social justice through government intervention. Rawls proposes the 'Difference Principle', which aims to benefit the least advantaged members of society and proposes a redistribution of wealth, while Nozick believes that taxation for redistribution violates individual rights. However, Rawls' theory faces critiques for the lack of adequate action in addressing relatively lower levels of poverty, and from communitarians who find the theory overly centred on individual rights.
