Introduction
Language is one of the most important forms of communication. It can be used to express a wide range of ideas, facts, feelings, and emotions. However, language can also be a complex system, and it relies on a set of conventions for its effective use. One such convention is the use of indexicals and demonstratives. Indexicals and demonstratives are an important feature of language that allows speakers to refer to things and events in the world and to locate them in space and time. In this essay, I will explain what indexicals and demonstratives are, why they are important for a theory of sense, and what problems they pose. I will also discuss how words such as 'left', 'rich', and 'now' can sometimes act as indexicals and at other times not, and consider potential solutions to these problems.
What Are Indexicals and Demonstratives?
Indexicals and demonstratives are words that are used to point to or indicate things and events in the world. Indexicals are words that refer to a specific context, such as the speaker or the time and place of the utterance. Demonstratives are words that point to a specific object in the world, such as 'this' or 'that.' These words are essential for communication, as they allow speakers to refer to things and events that are not present in the conversation.
Why Are They Important for a Theory of Sense?
Indexicals and demonstratives are essential for a theory of sense because they help to establish the meaning of words and sentences within a specific context. They allow speakers to refer to specific things and events in the world, and they provide a way of locating these things and events in space and time. For example, the sentence "I am here now" is only meaningful because it contains indexicals that reference the speaker's location and the time of the utterance. Without these indexicals, the sentence would be meaningless, and it would not convey any information.
In addition to establishing the meaning of words and sentences, indexicals and demonstratives are also important for understanding the speaker's intentions. For example, the sentence "Give me that book" is only meaningful because it contains a demonstrative that points to a specific book in the world. The speaker's intention is to receive the book that they are pointing to, and without the demonstrative, it would be impossible to understand the speaker's intention.
What Problems Do They Pose?
Despite their importance, indexicals and demonstratives pose several problems for a theory of sense. One problem is that the meaning of indexicals and demonstratives can be context-dependent. For example, the word "now" can have different meanings depending on the time of the utterance. If someone says "I am cooking now," the meaning of the word now refers to the present moment. However, if someone says "I was cooking now," the meaning of the word now refers to a past moment. The context-dependent nature of indexicals and demonstratives can make it difficult to establish their meaning and can lead to ambiguity and confusion.
Another problem with indexicals and demonstratives is that their reference can be imprecise or uncertain. For example, if someone says "Give me that book," without specifying which book they are referring to, it can be difficult to determine which book they want. Similarly, if someone says "I am here now," without specifying their location or time of the utterance, it can be difficult to determine where and when they are.
Words such as 'left', 'rich', and 'now' are Additional Examples
In addition to indexicals and demonstratives, words such as 'left', 'rich', and 'now' can also act as indexicals. For example, the sentence "turn left at the next intersection" contains an indexical that references a specific direction in the world. Similarly, the sentence "he was once rich but is now poor" contains an indexical that references a specific time period in the past and present. The sentence "I am here now" also contains indexicals that reference the speaker's location and the time of the utterance.
However, words such as 'left', 'rich', and 'now' can pose problems for a theory of sense when their reference is uncertain or ambiguous. For example, the sentence "I will meet you at the left of the building" can be ambiguous because it is unclear whether left refers to the speaker's direction or the other person's direction. Similarly, the sentence "he was rich" can be imprecise because it is unclear what level of wealth is being referred to.
Potential Solutions to These Problems
One potential solution to the problems posed by indexicals and demonstratives is to establish clear rules for their use. For example, speakers can use specific markers or gestures to indicate the referent of a demonstrative or indexical, such as pointing to the object or event being referred to. Another solution is to establish clear conventions for the use of context-dependent words, such as 'left', 'rich', and 'now.' These conventions can be established through the use of context-specific rules or definitions, such as specifying the direction of left or the level of wealth that constitutes being rich.
Conclusion
In conclusion, indexicals and demonstratives are an essential feature of language that allows speakers to refer to things and events in the world and to locate them in space and time. They are crucial for establishing the meaning of words and sentences within a specific context and for understanding the speaker's intentions. However, they also pose several problems for a theory of sense, including their context-dependent nature and their imprecise reference. These problems can lead to ambiguity and confusion, but they can be addressed through the establishment of clear rules and conventions for their use. Overall, indexicals and demonstratives are an important aspect of language that allows for effective communication and understanding.
