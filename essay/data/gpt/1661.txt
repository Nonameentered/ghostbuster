The opening paragraphs of Louise Erdrich's 'Tracks' and Sharon Old's' 'Her First Week' defy genre norms and employ literary techniques that captivate the reader's attention. These two pieces are significant in their own ways, providing a glimpse into the lives of characters, their experiences, and the world they live in. This essay will compare and analyze the opening paragraphs of 'Tracks' and 'Her First Week', highlighting how each defies genre norms and employs literary techniques.
Louise Erdrich's 'Tracks' tells the story of a Native American woman, Fleur Pillager, and her journey through life. The opening paragraph of the novel immediately sets the tone and captivates the reader's attention. Erdrich's writing style incorporates elements of magical realism, giving the novel a mythical and mysterious feel. The opening paragraph sets this tone by describing Fleur's birth as a miracle, "Fleur Pillager fell down the steps and drowned in the kitchen cupboard." (Erdrich, 3) The sentence is ambiguous, leaving the reader uncertain about whether Fleur died or survived the fall. This ambiguity sets the stage for a novel that will blur the line between reality and myth.
Erdrich then goes on to describe the setting, "It was 1912 and the air was so cold it was like walking with frozen feet on flint-like day, the dogs pulling at their leashes to turn south, wherever warmth might be found." (Erdrich, 3) The description of the cold sets the stage for what will be a dark and bleak tale. The metaphor of "walking with frozen feet on flint-like day" conveys a sense of the difficulty of the characters' lives. The mention of the dogs pulling at their leashes sets the scene, providing a vivid image that draws the reader in.
Sharon Olds' 'Her First Week' is a poem that explores the emotions and experiences of a new mother. The opening stanza of the poem immediately defies genre norms by its lack of conventionality. Olds uses a free verse form that lacks rhyme or meter, allowing her to convey raw emotion and experience. The opening stanza, "When I came back from the hospital late at night / as my father drove through the yellow porch-light shade / in his white shirt; in the car the curving end / of the infant carrier still sticking out of the door / as I unbuckled her sleeping body he walked /backward, holding my baby daughter out / taut to show her to me, the new life â€“" (Olds, 1) sets the stage for what will be an unconventional poem that does not conform to the norms of poetry.
Olds' use of imagery is vital to the poem's emotional impact. The image of the "curving end / of the infant carrier still sticking out of the door" provides a visual metaphor for the mother's hectic life, always on the move. The baby is depicted as a "taut" object, a metaphor for the tension between the mother and the child as they adjust to their new lives. The father's "white shirt" and the "yellow porch-light shade" convey a sense of comfort and home, a reassuring presence in contrast to the ambiguity of Fleur's birth and the cold in 'Tracks'.
In conclusion, both tracks and Her First Week defy genre norms and employ literary techniques that draw the reader in and set the stage for the stories to come. Erdrich's mastery of magical realism provides a mythic and mysterious feel to the novel, while Olds' lack of conventionality in form and use of imagery gives the poem an emotional impact. The two opening paragraphs offer a glimpse into the worlds of their respective characters and entice the reader to want to know more.
