We can also compare the distances travelled by both samples in order to roughly determine the isoelectric point of each. As the haemoglobin sample moved only one and a half centimetres we can say that it was less affected by the electric field (i.e. it had a smaller potential difference) than cytochrome c, which moved by four centimetres. In other words, the isoelectric point of haemoglobin is closer to pH 8.6 than the isoelectric point of cytochrome c, so that in the experiment haemoglobin had a net charge nearer to neutral.
