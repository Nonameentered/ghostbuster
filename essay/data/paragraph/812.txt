The data for the experimental and control group were compared to the known normative means. The comparison showed that for both EAT and SERS the experimental and control group had significantly lower scores than the normative means given by Nugent and Thomas (1993) (p<0.001). Therefore, there was a significant difference between the means for both EAT and SERS for the experimental group and the normative means. For BSQ there was a difference between the experimental and control groups and the normative mean given by Cooper et al (1987) (p<0.001). Therefore, for BSQ there was also a significant difference between the means for the experimental group and the normative mean.
