The behaviorist approach also fails to consider other factors such as those described by the psychodynamic and biological approaches. It has been proven that genetics can have an effect personality. Twin studies have shown that genetics are a major influence on personality and this should be considered when treating psychological disorders. This suggests that behaviourism is over-simplistic and too reductionist as it only considers stimulus-response.
