It is notable that males also suffer with eating disorders. However it is predominantly young females who are affected. This is why females are the only gender being used in this study, as the results will be far more reliable due to the high prevalence rate amongst us. It is believed however that this is not simply because they are more prone to the disorder, but that males are simply more inclined to hide their problems. Because of the social responses which eating disorders have, men are likely to be more concealed about their condition as most eating behaviour issues appear to be associated with femininity (McLaren et al, 2001). Research on this topic is also important because the age groups used for previous studies have been narrow.
