There have been a number of policies since the Second World War that have discriminated against non-whites, but also introduced the idea that they pose a threat to the British way of life. In 1948 the Nationality Act was introduced which designated Britain a 'white' country. This confirmed the 'white' status of Britain, as those who were not from 'white' countries were excluded from the nation (Solomos, 1989). This has been reinforced since the 1950s, as Margaret Thatcher stated in parliamentary debates and speeches that immigrants were taking away jobs and benefits from the 'true' British people, and through this construction immigrants became a problem to be solved (Solomos, 1989).
