The exact relation between humanists and reformers has been a matter of dispute among scholars of our time. It depends, firstly, on a definition of humanism. While humanism knew certain general traits, it was not necessarily confined by a certain theological outlook, and the humanist movement was never united on theological matters. In fact, the period after the reformation saw the emergence of a number of prominent Protestant humanists. Thus, we can say humanism and reformation were mutually influencing, the reformer often using humanist tools in his pursuits, while many humanists, often demonstratively Teutonic, admired the reformation movement.
