The findings from the one-way between-subjects MANOVA support the original hypothesis in that first year university students do have significantly more disordered eating than the control group of non-university participants. This is illustrated with the significant main effect for EAT with the experimental group having higher scores for deviant eating behaviour. These results seem to reinforce the suggestion that first year university students have higher levels of disordered eating than non university participants and that this is caused by factors associated with integrating into a new peer group and low self-esteem.
