Sporting practices and their associated subcultures have to be conceptualised as possessing a unique nature that allows them to function independently of the societal context within which they exist, if it is to be argued that they bear no relation whatsoever to the social construction of masculine ideals. This is because masculine ideals are created and shaped by the society in which they are located, yet they also affect the natures of the institutions and cultural forces that influence them. This essay is concerned with tracing the historical construction of sport, and with assessing the relationship (if any) in contemporary society between sporting practices, masculine ideals, and the dominant cultural and institutional forces of modern society in order to evaluate whether or not sporting practices are related to the social construction of masculine ideals.
