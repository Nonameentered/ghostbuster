Despite possible physiological ability for humans to be tetrachromats, there is evidence to suggest that human's are not usually tetrachromatic. Jordan and Mollen (1993) asked participants in an experiment who had medium and long wavelength specific genes on different x chromosomes (heterozygous carriers) to match ratios of red and green light, and yellow and green light. The finds that the test was not sensitive enough to detect tetrachromacy and the results of the heterozygous carriers and the trichromatic participants were the same. This suggest that humans do not have tetrachromatic vision as a general rule, but that this is only an ability which certain females possess. There are primates, such as New World Monkeys however, which have tetrachromatic colour vision. Neitz (2002) used microspectophotometer techniques to identify four photopsins in Owl Monkeys with peak sensitivities of 406nm, 507nm, 532nm and 560nm respectively. The fourth photopsin was shown to be a shifted long wavelength specific opsin with an absorption maxima of 560nm, as opposed to the 558nm of the normal long wavelength specific cone. Thus it can be seen that New World Monkeys have four wavelength specific cones, and Neitz (2002) was able to demonstrate that these are used to enhance colour vision. The light measurement techniques used demonstrate that the fourth wavelength specific photopsin is being used by the animals for a richer and more enhanced visual experience. The importance of this however is that it demonstrates that if an organism has four wavelength specific photopsins, it is physically and psychophysically capable of producing neural mechanisms to allow tetrachromatic vision to be used.
