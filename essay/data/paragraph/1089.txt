There is a possibility that the multiple responsibilities of the Church in society may have led to its resources becoming over-stretched, hence, compromising on the primary role of the Church to minister the sacraments. Swanson puts forth the idea that most of the anti-clericals "wanted churchmen to behave just as churchmen, rather than officious, interfering, lordly bureaucrats." However, the Church had for centuries combined both its temporal and spiritual responsibilities without much difficulty, and it appears rather peculiar that the church would find it hard to cope with its dual roles on the eve of the Reformation. Moreover, the increased accessibility of university education provided the necessary training for aspiring civil servants, and this would have taken the burden off the Church as a source of administrative officials, implying perhaps that the Church could concentrate more on its primary, spiritual function.
