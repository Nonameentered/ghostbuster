Lombroso also believed that besides hostility towards kin, criminals also were especially friendly towards strangers and felt an affinity with animals. Throughout the novel Dorian Gray proves popular with the other characters, courting the affection of various females (most prominently Sybil Vane and the Duchess, but Gray comments on numerous occasions that he has experienced much female attention throughout his life) and Basil, and also in striking an immediate friendship with Henry Wooton. When Dorian Gray goes hunting with Sir Geoffrey Clouston, he begs him not to shoot a rabbit because 'there was something in the animal's grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray' Therefore Wilde even weaves some of the less prominent Lombrosian characteristics of the born criminal into his characterisation of Dorian Gray.
