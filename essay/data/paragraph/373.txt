During his terms in office, Eisenhower did more than any previous President to integrate science into the state. Yet, in his farewell address he exhibited more than a powerful note of irony, warning that 'we must be alert to the...danger that policy could become the captive of a scientific-technological elite'. As the premier authority on the Doomsday Machine, Dr Strangelove - struggling with his 'Heil-Hitler' hand and speaking in a terse German accent, which denotes his Nazi affiliations - is devoid of love for anything except the bomb. Despite his mental deterioration, the leadership cede all power to him by the end, as they are completely distracted by his plans to continue the human race. Dr Strangelove can be seen as a parody of the Hydrogen Bomb scientist Dr Edward Teller. Repudiated by many of his scientific colleagues for testifying against Robert Oppenheimer, who called for nuclear restraint and internationalism, Teller ran with a more military crowd, becoming the darling of conservative thinkers for his advocacy of American scientific supremacy.
