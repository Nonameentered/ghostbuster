In the eastern regions however, the most important factor in determining post-war governments was the presence of the Red Army. It has been argued that, as the Red Army entered into designated Soviet spheres of influence in Eastern Europe with its plans of liberation, the place of the liberating forces in determining the situation of the communist parties was increasingly politicised. As the Red Army took control of Lithuania, Romania, and Bulgaria, they imposed the commissar system, replacing civilian administrations with a military one. This gave Moscow a direct control over the region and provided the new governments with legitimacy, which was not necessarily based on the popular democratic choice, as the populations of the respective countries had not been given the opportunity to exercise their will. Moscow's treatment of Poland is an example of this. As the Red Army advanced further, regaining a sizable part of the country, the Lublin committee, had already declared its authority and was thus allowed to remain in power. The composition of the government was thus determined by the Soviet Union's desire for a government loyal to Moscow, rather than the will of the people. But according to Miko Miko The effects of these changes were felt almost immediately, with east European liberation becoming a synonym for the success of the communist parties and the growing prominence of Soviet alliance. Britain, in particular, was damaged in the eyes of East European countries. Despite having made several commitments to the Polish government, the British acted with little haste when it came to getting Polish citizens back to their homes. This perceived slow assistance on behalf of Britain prompted a cooling of political relations and led to the Poles viewing 'Britain as an antagonist of almost equal magnitude to the Soviet Union'.
