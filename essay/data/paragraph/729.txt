Whilst this has elements of truth, it fails to note Asia's technological superiority. East Asian irrigation systems developed during the early centuries of the millennium, such as the Grand Canal of China, were far superior to their European equivalents. Also, hydraulic devices such as the Persian wheel created a more effective method of drainage, meaning that peasants could, to some extent, control the natural environment. In comparison, much of European environmental control was still in its primordial stage, reliant upon animal powered ploughing and agricultural techniques such as three field farming- a process with low efficiency due to crop-rotation.
