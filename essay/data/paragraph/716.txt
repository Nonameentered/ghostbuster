In terms of Dorian Gray himself, Wilde uses Lombroso's theory as a vehicle to display his deterioration through the portrait. Although this does not concur with Lombroso's belief that criminality was hereditary, it does exploit the concept of immorality having physical effects- even if it is in retrospect and evident only on the portrait (as Gray has bound himself to a lifetime of youthfulness). For instance, Gray is described as observing 'its beautiful marred face' Gray also comments that 'if a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself in the lines of his mouth, the droop of his eyelids' Therefore, Wilde uses Lombrosian theory as a basis for the physical description of many characters, but in Dorian Gray himself manipulates the concept to turn it into a literary vehicle with which to sustain the reader's attention. Lombroso believed indicative physical features were inherited and present from birth; Wilde depicted them as appearing and mutating as the soul of Dorian Gray began to degenerate.
