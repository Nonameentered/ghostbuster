Whilst the Columbian Exchange failed to reform the staple diet of the New World, other products such as meat, fruit and vegetables- which complimented the existing foundation of maize, manioc and potatoes- were successfully incorporated into the indigenous nutritional regime. Seventeenth century naturalist Bernabe Coco claimed that 'we Spaniards found so poor and destitute of the animals most necessary to nourish and give service to mankind' Columbus' voyages to the Americas marked the immediate transference of such items as the ships contained food representative of a microcosm of the Spanish diet, including livestock. On his second voyage Columbus brought seeds and cuttings for melons, onions, radishes, salad greens, grape vines, sugar canes and fruit stones for orchards. Bananas were also brought over from the Canary Islands in 1516 by European settlers. As Super notes 'the combination of New and Old World vegetables, full of minerals and vitamins, self-propagating or easily grown, provided a rich, abundant element in the emerging nutritional regimes' The indigenous population may not have been receptive to foodstuffs that fundamentally undermined the basis of their existing diet, but they did accept items that could enrich it. The proliferation of crops and items was also beneficial in that the increased variety of products reduced the chance of crop failures and starvation. As Gary Paul Nabhan observes, diversity aided Latin Americans as 'different crops respond in different ways to drought, early freezes, insects, and diseases' However, it is debatable to what extent these products were grown for dietary reasons, for in many cases they were cultivated for commercial distribution. As Crosby notes 'the economic underpinnings of most of the important European settlements in the tropical and semitropical zones of America historically have been the raising of a certain few crops on large plantations for export to Europe' This is typified in the introduction of sugar, for by the 1530s there were thirty-four sugar mills on the island of Espanola, and by 1610 fifty seven thousand tonnes of sugar were being produced annually in Brazil. In Brazil production was carried out through the use of slave labour, demonstrating the greater effect of food introduction for European commercial gain rather than local diet reformation; workers nutrition was subordinate to quest for profit.
