Security is another form of social capital that can be created by having children. As well as being a source of security in the form of constant love, they can also provide social and financial security, especially in old age. Morrell found that many women feared old age, as women are now living longer than men (1994) and this fear can mean that women choose to have children to ensure their security, therefore making them an important social resource.
