Not all behavioural therapies use positive reinforcement as Skinner suggested though, and negative, punishing therapies have been used for many years. Aversion therapy is a form of behaviour modification that employs an unpleasant or even painful stimulus to prevent certain unwanted behaviour in patients. The first recorded use of this was in 1930 for the treatment of alcoholism, an area where it is still used today, but in the 1950s aversion therapy was widely accepted as a 'treatment' for sexual deviation such as homosexuality. Men could be shown images of attractive men whilst being administered an electric shock, and then shown pictures of women afterwards. In many cases this didn't work at all but simply gave its patients nightmares. Today aversion therapy is occasionally used on alcoholics, where chemicals such as disulfiram or Antabuse can be given, which react with alcohol to cause nausea and vomiting. The idea is to allow the patient to associate alcohol with the nausea and reduce or prevent excessive drinking, (Eysenck, 2002). Although this can have immediate beneficial effects, it is unethical to cause any patient such discomfort and often does not work in a number of cases where alcoholism has become a way of life and the cause is rooted in deeper psychological problems. Negative reinforcement is not such an effective way of altering behaviour as rewards. It is also criticised for being a controlling approach and it is sometimes asked in who's interest is the treatment - the individual or society? In cases such as alcoholism, paedophilia and antisocial personality disorder the treatment may work in the treatment situation but not in the unpredictable situations of real life, and they often target only the problem, not the cause of behaviour.
