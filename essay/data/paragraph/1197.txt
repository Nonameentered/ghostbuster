It is still extremely questionable whether a newborn's knowledge of the world is innate or learnt, despite evidence from various studies. A methodological flaw common in most developmental studies is that the sample sizes tend to be extremely small, thus causing issues of generalisation. In respect to the infant's ages in studies claiming innateness, it would be reasonable to assume that they are far too young to have been effected by the environment around them to learn the behaviour and therefore has strong grounds for being innate. However, it is still possible for the behaviour to have been learnt even in a very short period of time as studies have also shown that learning can start as early as the foetal years. Thus the robustness of measuring innateness come under the question of whether it is actually ever possible to measure. As research into child development has increased, it has become evident that there are very few, if any, strictly 'innate' behaviours. Most behaviour seems to be developed further by some environmental factor or another. Therefore, rigorous analysis of neonatal development will often reveal that any particular behaviour is a complex combination of both innate and learnt components.
