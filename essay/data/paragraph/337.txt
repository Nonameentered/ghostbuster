It is evident that in 1934, expenditure on air services were still at This period of relative solvency was short lived. The financial outlook was soon to be darkened by the coming of the 'bald' year of 1935 and the further austerity a To understand the context of Britain's comparative air strength during the period, we will compare our data with French and German estimates in Table 1 below. It thus appears that Britain still held pre-eminence in relative air strength, a fact that conveniently ignored all the deficiencies within it. Nonetheless, British standing had fallen since 1932, most noticeably in the ratio of proportion of total expenditure devoted to the air services in 1  German force has increased drastically from However, are these figures actually telling us anything of real tactical value to air strategy? Do they explain why one force was better than the other? Should policy makers have used them at all? These points can only be settled by further detailed scrutiny of other evidence. Nevertheless, the Table provides a basis in assessing the comparative air strength situation in Europe, a fact upon which it is possible to build sensible conclusions; though we must recognise that caveats must be taken with such figures.
