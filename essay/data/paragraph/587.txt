The steps taken to invade the host cell by are complex and require a number of gene products (28-30). Foremost amongst these are the dot/icm genes (26, 28) that are the basis for the type IV secretion system. This system consists of more than twenty proteins which facilitate the translocation of virulence-promoting effector proteins between the bacterium and the host (30, reviewed in 1). By direct injection into the host cytoplasm via so called ‘pores’, these effectors can inhibit or modify physiologic responses that would otherwise hinder infection.
