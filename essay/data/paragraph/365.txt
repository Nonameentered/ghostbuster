The black comedy ending of For Kubrick, the logical result of Soviets 'lofting satellites as easily as Americans dunked baskets' and bomb shelters proliferating like greenhouses, was nuclear Armageddon. Cynically rejecting the safeguards projected in When General Turgidson argues for 'catching them with their pants down', in a pre-emptive first strike, Turgidson's insane proposal is no different from the calls by Air Force chief General Curtis LeMay to give them 'Sunday punch'. Recent findings support Kubrick's observation on the instability of the arms race. We now know that the military had developed the 'Single Integrated Operations Plan', which worked on the assumption that America would have been willing to be the first to use nuclear weapons.
