How then do the authors of Only a paragraph seems enough: 'The studies of "blacks" or "Latinos" or "Asians" who live in America generally denote people who say they are black, Latino or Asian - no more, no less' (p. 271), and further they write 'race differences are varied and complex - and they make the human species more adaptable and more interesting' (p. 272). In this way, the authors appear to draw a direct connection between personally perceived ethnic differences and the distribution of cognitive abilities for different human groupings. It can, however, conversely be argued that, like all over the world humans are expected to be born with two arms and two legs, the distribution of intelligence may be expected to fit into a similar predictable model worldwide.
