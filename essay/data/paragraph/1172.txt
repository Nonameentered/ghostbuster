This explains how leptin controls weight by causing feelings of hunger and satiety. During starvation, leptin levels decrease, eliciting a behavioural, neurochemical and metabolic response. Weight gain increases leptin levels and induces a different response, leading to a state of negative energy balance. During dieting leptin levels fall, which may account for the low success rate of dieting, as low leptin is likely to stimulate weight gain (Friedman & Halaas, 1998).
