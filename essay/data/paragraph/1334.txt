As it stands now, the science curriculum is structured around learning scientific concepts rather than individual topics. While this is a more practical application of teaching in the primary school setting, it seems that subject driven teaching may produce better results in the pupils. The above research indicates that children can attend to things a concept at a time. It shows that the onset of the understanding of these concepts occurs at different ages in children. However, difficulties can arise with the introduction of this new kind of curriculum. The aim of the science curriculum after all, is to foster a broad, conceptual understanding which can be linked to scientific processes in the real world (Whitby and Hollis, 2004). Watt (1998), places emphasis on the fact that children should be taught science within an organised framework, and not just as isolated bits of information. While she admits that isolated knowledge is easier to teach, she believes it to be detrimental to the children's understanding and contextualisation of science in the long term. Oelkers (1998), stresses the importance of empirical research on the progression of education, stating that it is needed especially to promote public interest in education reform.
