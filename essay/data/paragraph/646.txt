In this essay I will argue that Habermas retains many aspects of Marxist theory in his work, in terms of some of the concepts he uses as well as the particular area of society he chooses to study. However, his work also includes many changes to orthodox Marxian work including his view on modern capitalist development and his placing of importance on the superstructure rather than the economic base. Perhaps the most apt descriptions of Habermas's work in relation Marxian thought are as a 'positive critique' (Heller in Thompson and Held, 1982; 23) or a 'positive revision' (Layder, 1994; 187). I will argue that Habermas's ideal speech situation as a means of emancipation, though not without some merit, seems deeply flawed as the general, universal, widely used and practical system it was intended.
