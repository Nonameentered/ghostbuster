The development of the critical realist framework of science provided a methodology and ontology that was applicable to social reality, and it was Roy Bhaskar's classic text A Realist Theory of Science (RST) which established the basis of Bhaskar's project (Bhaskar, 1989 [1979]; xi). This 'humanistic naturalism' as it was later termed (through reframing it with a specifically social ontological emphasis) was then extended upon by Margaret Archer in her seminal text TMGA.
