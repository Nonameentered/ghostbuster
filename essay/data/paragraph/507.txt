The next step was to add 1ml of 1M casein solution to each of the nine test tubes (one of each for each of the buffer solutions) containing 0.3M to 1mM acetic acid. At each of the different concentrations it was visible that either complete or partial precipitation had formed. The same effect occurred for all nine samples.
