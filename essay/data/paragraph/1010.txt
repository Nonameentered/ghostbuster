Formula racing engines are used in many types of racing, such as Formula 1, Formula 2 and Formula 3. Each engine should comply with the regulations such as intake, exhaust, maximum displacement, total weight and numerical of cylinders limits for their uses in Formula 1 racing. All formula racing engines had to be naturally aspirated and at least two camshafts could have been used. Normally a V10 engine (Figure 4) was used in Formula-1 racing since the regulation of FIA has determined the maximum numerical of cylinders is 10 and the cylinder should have a 90Â° angle between them.
