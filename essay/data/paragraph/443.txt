The experiment aimed to investigate conjugation and recombination in bacteria by mapping the relative order of genes along the chromosome. This was achieved by mixing a donor strain and a recipient strain, allowing them to conjugate for a certain time period to allow genetic exchange and then physically disrupting the mating pairs and plating onto selective plates. By looking at which plates showed growth at which times it was possible to map the order of genes on the chromosome.
