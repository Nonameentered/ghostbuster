Results  The gearbox design process was conducted successfully. The necessary calculations and investigations for surface and bending stresses as well as torsional analysis were performed various times and the results from computer program and manual method quite agreed with each other. This could be seen from the analysis of shaft, where there werenâ€™t any major changes were observed regarding their diameters regarding both computer and manual outputs. The maximum shear force and bending moment were observed and calculated according to the maximum loading conditions. Moreover, the size of bearings was chosen near the final stage according to the diameter and length of the shaft which had been previously decided.
