The term Renaissance comes from the Italian word The movement looked back to the superior aspects of ancient times and integrated them with the new developments of the time. The Italian Renaissance is generally associated with the fifteenth century. This period, however, can be stretched in either direction. For example, the term "Renaissance" has been used to describe some thirteenth-century artists, and the great artists of the Renaissance were active until the end of the sixteenth century. The rebirth of the visual arts was one aspect of the Renaissance but the development of humanism and the classical studies of the universities were as important. There were also advancements in music, literature, science and government practices during this period. How far Florence was responsible for these developments can be debated. Robert Black asserts that 'the elitism of Florentine society and the monopoly which the Florentine patriciate had over classical culture made Florence the first and greatest capital of the Renaissance' Jocelyn Hunt, on the other hand, believes that 'the assumption that Florence was pre-eminent is... Burckhardtian, since, it is argued, the scholars of the Renaissance were based in Rome, and in the other universities'
