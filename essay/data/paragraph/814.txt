The research question was; do first year university students have significantly more disordered eating than a control group of non-university participants? It can be said with confidence that yes, they do have significantly more disordered eating than the control group. This was established by the one way between subjects MANOVA. From comparing the mean scores it was clear that the experimental group was more eating disordered, and by using a Bonferroni adjusted level of 0.17 a significant difference between the means was established. This is a substantial finding as it has been illustrated that first year university girls have substantially more disorders than those not at university.
