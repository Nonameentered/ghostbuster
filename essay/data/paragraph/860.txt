There is however a large problem with this evidence regarding it's generalisability to real jury decision making processes. In real trials the evidence is not presented in "story order" but is presented in "witness order", which produces a complex disorganization of the evidence. All Pennington and Hastie (1992) have shown is that in certain situations, where the evidence is neatly ordered into a coherent story, this is likely to influence the jurors' interpretation of the evidence, and therefore the verdict. This does not contemplate the complex reorganisation the brain has to implement on the evidence and how in this situation stories are created. The whole point of the story board model is to demonstrate how jurors take complex and disordered evidence and make sense of it by imposing order and meaning onto it through the narrative of the story. This is not illustrated in research such as this which already imposes the order.
