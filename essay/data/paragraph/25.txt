Since the fourteenth century the practice of medicine has become a profession, and more importantly, a male-dominated profession. Previously medicine was seen as a female duty, however all areas of medicine have been professionalized over the centuries, and slowly become male-dominated, even the practice of obstetrics, which until the twentieth century, was still viewed as a female responsibility.
