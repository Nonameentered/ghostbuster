Behaviour therapy is often used in the treatment of psychological disorders. There are many merits to this method. It teaches patients how to prevent themselves from being in situations that they fear or feel anxious about. It also arms patients with the knowledge of what to expect. Knowledge is power and having this knowledge means the patients are better equipped with their fear and anxiety. However, this method is also reductionist and deterministic as it does not consider other factors such as biological, psychodynamic and cognitive factors. These factors might play a big part in the patient's fear and feel anxious about or anxiety and by excluding such therapies, behaviour therapists might not be really addressing the problem. They might merely be teaching their patients how to repress their fear and anxiety.
