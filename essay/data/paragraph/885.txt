The role of the Soviet people's morale in the war's success is highly debated. Whilst David Read argues that 'the people's basic commitment to the struggle was crucial.' John Barber suggests that 'the Soviet relationship between government and people was imposed from above by the regime.' It is widely accepted that the involvement and support of the Soviet people was the critical factor that allowed Stalin to survive and eventually combine with his allies to defeat Germany. There are many aspects of the Soviet people's role in the war that can be considered. One these is the people's contribution to the economy, which required great will and endurance. People worked in defence production, and mines and when the Germans invaded Russia became an agrarian society. The people had to feed their own army.
