Figures have shown that the amount of time children spend watching television has increased (Hamilton, 1998; Brown and Cantor, 2000; Bushman and Anderson, 2001). Children are considered inhabitants of a world inundated by mass media (Brown and Witherspoon, 2002). A controversial issue is when the content of the viewed material contains violence and aggression. The frequency of this content in television programmes and in films was quantified concisely by Browne and Hamilton-Giachritsis (2005). Results from the UNESCO Global Television Violence study show that 61% of programmes investigated contained violence, 55% of which portrayed violence in a realistic setting. They also report that in 71% of these instances, characters showed no remorse for their actions and received no criticism for them. 42% of aggressive acts reported were associated with humour. Over 1000 violent murders, rapes and assaults are shown on television each year (Brown and Witherspoon, 2002).
