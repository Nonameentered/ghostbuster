China has long been an object of fascination for Europe, and nowhere is this enthrallment more apparent than in seventeenth and eighteenth-century Europe. From its mystical land of Cathay, the Chinese goods, ranging from silk to porcelain, seemed exotic and miraculous to the Europeans which helped fuel a demand and ensuing luxury trade. This paper will examine the fascination that Europe had for Chinese luxury goods, and how this manifested itself in the particular context of the seventeenth and eighteenth-century. It will demonstrate that this fascination was an amalgam- a complex cocktail- of exoticism, taste, sociability and civility, narcissism, progress and most importantly, of the mystique and secrecy that shrouded the production processes of the goods. Specifically, this paper will ascertain the role of the East India Companies (EICs) in marketing and 'customising' the Chinese goods in order to cater to western markets, and how this contributed to the fascination that Europe had for Chinese luxury goods.
