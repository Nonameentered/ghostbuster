Due to the immense pressure the caregiver is under, elder abuse is not uncommon; in fact physical abuse by trusted caregivers is among the most common type of violent offense experienced by older adults (Payne, 2002). Poor premorbid relationships in particular, have been found to be a key factor in predicting abuse and challenging behaviors are also heavily correlated with abuse (Compton et al, 1997). The psychological strain placed upon the carer could not only lead to violence but also to neglect (Pritchard, 1995). However, neglect may purely be down to an unawareness of appropriate ways to provide care (Johnson, 1995, as cited in Payne, 2002), hence highlighting the need for training for caregivers. For example, anger is very common in caregivers, hence it is imperative to identify and treat these negative thoughts in order prevent harm to the patient. Devries and Gallagher-Thompson (1993, as cited in Maciejewski, 2001) proposed a group treatment using a cognitive approach that challenges and replaces the negative thoughts with more adaptive cognitions accompanied by relaxation and assertion training strategies.
