Differences between the situation in 1905 and 1917 help highlight its 'failure'; for example, although it could be argued that almost all sections of the Russian population were against the Tsar in 1905, the situation in 1917 was more acute. The opposition was more ready for action, the concessions made in 1905 had been proved insincere, scapegoats for the people's continuing misery such as Russian minorities, had grown angry and organised, and the army defied orders. Moreover, central to the 'failure' of the 1905 revolt, was the reality that its aims were initially not political, but were in fact economical. The strikers wanted better working conditions, and the peasants' land reform, though some sections of the opposition such as the intelligentsia were looking towards a more democratic society, many wanted to accommodate these changes within the existing Tsarist framework. The aims of 1905 were not revolution for the majority of people. Instead their aims seem to have been in search of better life conditions and above all to be listened to by their managers, and the authorities; and at least to some extent these aims were realised in 1905. Through striking, managers were forced to pay attention to their subordinates, and some changes such as a shorter working day were implemented. Likewise, although the sincerity of the October Manifesto, as well as the Tsars' support of it can be questioned, it was still a concession the autocracy were forced to make. Though the Duma proved to have little autonomy or power, 1905 was a building block towards further changes. I would argue that the 1917 revolution would not have occurred without it; therefore to suggest it was simply a failure seems too deterministic an explanation.
