Determining the functions of the Holocaust memorials is integral to the answering of the question. How the Holocaust is memorialised, and the form it takes is largely dependant on the perceived functions of the memorials. Memorials can be built as a result of a government's need to explain a nation's past to itself (in the case of Germany and France); to educate the next generation and to inculcate a sense of shared experience and destiny; as expiations of guilt and self-aggrandizement; and even to attract tourists. An extreme case in which a memorial was built for political ends was when President Jimmy Carter proposed the building of a national memorial in Washington D.C. in order to placate Jewish supporters angered by his sale of F-15 fighter planes to Saudi Arabia. Much of the USA's enthusiasm for memorial building was in part due to the declaration of solidarity with the influential American Jews, as well as in support of her ally Israel. Similarly, the initial code of silence surrounding the Holocaust immediately after the war was due to the more urgent need for reconciliation with West Germany, in the face of the Communist threat. Hence, as James E. Young concluded 'All such memorial decisions are made in political time, contingent on political realities.'
