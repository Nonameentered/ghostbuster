The implications of this are that women have the potential to be tetrachromatic in comparison to men, as women are capable of having four different types of cone cells available to the visual system. This is a highly significant proposition as it suggests the possibility of having heightened colour experiences, that trichromats are not capable of. For women to become tetrachromatic they have to inherit an alanine substituted red opsin on one x chromosome, and the original serine substituted red opsin on the other x chromosome (Jordan and Mollen, 1993). If a woman is heterozygous, this means she has the potential to express both types of red opsins in different cells on the outer plexiform layer of the retina.
