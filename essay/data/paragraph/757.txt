Wealthy citizens would spend their riches on art and culture. The amount they spent was seen to be an indication of their power and status. Florentine men did not own armies, rather hired mercenaries when they were needed. This meant that they had more to spend on luxuries. Giovanni Rucellai, a Florentine merchant, wrote in 1473 that 'earning and spending are among the greatest pleasures that men enjoy in this life' He, himself, spent much of his wealth on the buildings of Florence, including his house and the loggia opposite, the church of Santa Maria Novella and the church of San Pancrazio. Commissioning artists gave them the opportunities to try out new styles and techniques as well as copying the styles of the ancients. Florence was important in the development of the Italian Renaissance because the artists working there were given these opportunities.
