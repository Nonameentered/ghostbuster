Mutations are naturally occurring events in any genome and they can be point mutation, where a single base pair might be changed or more serious large-scale mutations, such as deletions, which involve removal of very long kilo bases of DNA. These mutations are one of many mechanisms that bring change into genome of a species. When the characteristic brought about by the mutation, allow the organism to better fit the changing environment, the organism survives and passes down the trait through reproduction, bringing about evolution. The estimated mutation rate of E. coli is 2.5x10 However, it takes a few generations for a rare beneficial mutation to dominate. The bacteria with the normal gene is known as the 'wild type' and the transfer of a 'wild type' gene to an organism with a mutation in that gene will ensure restoration of that gene activity due to recombination.
