A phylogenetic tree or a molecular clock, based on the comparison of rRNA, or Ribosomal Ribonucleic Acid, of prokaryotes and organelles were studied and the results showed that the rRNA between these organisms were more alike than the between the eukaryotes and prokaryotes, implying they shared a common ancestor in the past There is further evidence, such as the detection of trans-spliced introns, in the organellar genome, which are present in eukaryotes but not prokaryotes. Mitochondrial introns have been detected in molluscs and Insects, both of which are distant relatives; this suggest that introns have been present, and have been passed down, throughout evolution
