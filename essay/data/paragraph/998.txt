. Compare to normal engines, limits such as peak operating cylinder pressure were pushed up in some racing engines so that a higher performance could be obtained. Besides, the horsepower and fuel economy could be increased by maximizing the cylinder pressure. Although the cylinder pressure could be increased by increasing the compression ratio, alternative technique could also be used since cylinder pressures could be altered significantly by using camshaft selection, carburetion, nitrous and supercharging. Compression pressures could be adjusted drastically by installing supercharging, turbo-charging or intercooling system. However, apart from installing extra equipment to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of racing engines, the durability and lifetime were also a significant factor to consider since racing cars might require to operation for a long time without any failures
