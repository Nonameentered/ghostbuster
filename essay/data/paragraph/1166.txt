The criticisms associated with qualitative research indicate that we need to formulate a set of criteria that allows the quality of analysis to be evaluated (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994, as cited in Merrick, 1993). Having said this, it is also possible that we could evaluate the research, especially in terms of validity, by using the above-mentioned method of allowing the readers to judge the interpretations themselves. The use of verbal reports and discourse analysis has increased in popularity as a research method and has resulted in many contributions to the study of psychology. Nevertheless, this method does have its problems. Discourse analysis does not have an answer to any psychological query; therefore it cannot be plugged into a particular pre-defined question. Therefore discourse analysis should not be seen as just a research method but also as a whole perspective on social life, (Potter, 1996). Also, there is the hope that in the future, discourse analysis will continue to develop further and offer considerable more contributions to the various aspects of psychology.
