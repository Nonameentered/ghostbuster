Where did Hitler feature in this chaotic system of rule? It has been said that '...the symbolic Fuhrer authority was more important than the direct governing will of the person Hitler' For his part, Hitler encouraged Social Darwinism within the party and state, allowing competing interests to fight it out amongst themselves, through which, a victor emerges, or a consensus is reached, which would then have the backing of the Fuhrer. This laissez-faire attitude seemed to have compromised the standing of the Fuhrer on the affairs of the state, which is reinforced by records telling of Hitler's laid-back attitude to work. However, to conclude that Hitler was a weak dictator and that this in turn affected the standing of the Third Reich as a dictatorship would be unjustified. Though Hitler took a very long time to act, 'but when he did, his personal orders, or Despite the apparent success of this policy of Social Darwinism, it must be noted that this system 'led inexorably to an accelerating decline into aggression, lawlessness and criminal brutality' The system was essentially a very cracked pot, held together only by the 'glue', which was Hitler's authority.
