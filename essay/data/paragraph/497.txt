In this experiment the moment of inertia of the three discs using linear and rotational analogy are determined by experimenting with a weight that is attach to a moment arm. The experiment is carried out three times at three different disc sizes. The average results of the measurements are then compared with the data obtained from the theoretical relationship.  The results obtained are found to be consistent with the data obtained from the theoretical relationship. The maximum percentage of error of the results and theoretical value are 7%. From this experiment, it can be concluded that
