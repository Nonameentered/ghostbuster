Cluster differentiation antigen 4 (CD4) is found on the surface of T helper (Th) cells, which are responsible for the acquisition and transduction of the signal (17, reviewed in 1). Interleukin-2 secretion follows the binding of antigen to CD4, and this acts as an activating signal for the recruitment of effector CD8 T cells (18, reviewed in 1). It is these CD8 T cells that represent the main weapon against intracellular pathogens. CD8 T cells have been shown to respond to
