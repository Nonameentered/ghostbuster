When looking at the social interaction between customers and personnel, I can report the following. Generally, the personnel are very diplomatic and try to maintain a polite distance. Most of the transactions (of which there are plenty, due to the proximity of the counter to the entrance, offering customers a view of what the shop has to offer upon entering) were kept fairly brief. All personnel and customers polite in their interaction and conversations were usually quite commonplace. As such, I observed that the personnel tried to ensure a relatively subtle introduction of the shop's values to potential customers. Furthermore, the personnel were also quite active in highlighting certain types of books that are apparently part of the store's identity. This was obviously more successful with customers that seemed to come into the shop with an open mind.  I noticed that most people went downstairs in search for books; only a few stayed upstairs on the second floor, where I was also situated. The second floor is dedicated to less-commonly read books, such as Austrian literature, study books and reference works. It creates the atmosphere of a quiet reading room, with a few salon tables, a couch and several book shelves on the wall, without any employees around. To a certain extent I could observe the reading guests, and this is what I noticed.
