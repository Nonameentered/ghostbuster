By the mid-1840s, the spectrum of voices demanding change had drastically expanded. Demands for representative government, democratic rights, and an end to feudal privileges were finding their way through Europe, eventually leading to the European revolution of 1848. In this context, Marx and Engels, in 1846, came to the important conclusion that 'the workers had no country'. As European nations armed themselves for war, Marx and Engels saw the workers' lack of natural rights to determine collective existence as their main weakness. To overcome this obstacle, they wrote: 'The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win'. In their minds, the coming revolution had to extend far beyond the political changes of 1848, seeking ultimate emancipation. They determined 'the special mission of the working class: to do away with the old capitalist society saturated or fettered as it is everywhere with conservatism and with injustice â€“ and to lay the foundation for a new society without class antagonisms'.
