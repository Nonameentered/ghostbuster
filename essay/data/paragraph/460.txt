From the graph showing the effect of pH on the product concentration an optimal range for the pH of the reaction can be determined. This is seen to be between pH 8 and 10 where the product concentration is greatest (see graph 1). This range is due to the enzyme itself being more active at a higher pH and is known as the enzymeâ€™s optimal pH.
