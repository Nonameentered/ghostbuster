From these findings, two models have emerged to explain the impact of emotion on memory. The first is the emotion-as-information hypothesis of Berntson (1992, as cited in Eich et al, 2000), which proposes that emotion can act as an easy-to-process cue, and that when emotion is present during encoding, it speeds up the retrieval of saliently encoded strong memories. This theory suggests that memories are processed as a whole, and when emotion is present, it acts as an indicator of the importance of the information, thus the emotional context enhances learning (Baddeley, 1997).
