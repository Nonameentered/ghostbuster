The ideas of the Enlightenment have certainly had a great effect on the revolutionaries. Boosted by the 'public sphere'-the salons, academies, public lectures and pamphlets- the French people inculcated into their minds the principles of liberty, equality and fraternity, and this sense of 'enlightened patriotism', inspired patriotism and nationhood in the French people (Falkstein). The influence of the philosophes was particularly felt amongst the intellectuals, as the success of the Encyclopedia promoted among them the 'bold reforms and experiments ', though not necessarily a 'revolution in government.' According to Hobsbawm, the contents of the Encyclopedia reinforced the idea of political nationhood in the French, as people became aware of their intellectual and moral certainties, in contrast to 'the universal arid unattainable ideal of all humanity." The humanist optimisms of the Enlightenment, which has made people believe that they could shape their own destinies, by rational will and inquiry, also contributed to the rise of the revolutionary ideas in France.
