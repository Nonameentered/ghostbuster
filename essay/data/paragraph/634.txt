In this essay I will try to explore the reasons why for some women at least, the gap between theory and practice in the social position of women between 1500 and 1700 was unavoidable, and in some cases openly flaunted. I will look at the economic factors which made it difficult for women to live within their expected role, the personal factors which made this situation even harder, and finally areas of society which gave women power and control over their role, leading to a degree of negotiation and renegotiating of the prescribed position.
