Hatcher suggests that Wrigley and Schofield manipulate data to exaggerate fertility and lessen the significance of mortality; he argues that the presentation of information in Although Hatcher accepts that this was purely coincidental, 'a historical accident', it still demonstrates that the prominence awarded to fertility by Wrigley and Schofield is not necessarily historically accurate but is based more upon interpretation, evidence and methodology used. From '1551 to 1566 falling fertility was the main driving force until the "golden period of low mortality" turned the tables; 1571 to 1611 was a period of relatively stable fertility and mortality "fertility and mortality contributed equally to the steady fall", fertility was dominant from 1671 to 1691 but mortality was most clearly the more important influence on growth rates from 1691 to 1751." Hatcher sums up these characteristics and finds that 'fertility is held to dominate for around thirty-five years of the two-hundred year time span, mortality for around sixty-five years and that for a century the two variables exerted approximately equal influence." This evidence is 'immediately contradicted' by Wrigley and Schofield through the use of 'quinquennial averages', and the discarding of 'three episodes of very high mortality before 1751'.
