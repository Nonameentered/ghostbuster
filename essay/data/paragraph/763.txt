Florence's important contribution to the arts can be seen in the proportion of Italy's cultural elite, the people whose creative abilities are recognized in society, which originated from around Florence. Burke has calculated that around 26 per cent of the elite came from Tuscany, which had only 10 per cent of the population, while the Veneto had 20 per cent of the population but only around 23 per cent of the elite Burke believes that 'Rome's poor contribution needs emphasis' Rome was no longer the beautiful, classical city that it was in ancient times. 'The Middle Ages reversed Augustus's boast that he had found Rome a city of brick and left it one of marble' Materials from ancient monuments had been taken for other purposes and marble had been burnt for lime. Rome was in ruins with woods and undergrowth which sheltered foxes, wolves and hares. Rome's population was smaller then Florence's and was much poorer. This helps to explain Florence's dominance in the development of the Italian Renaissance.
