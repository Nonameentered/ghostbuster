This mathematical approach to jury deliberation does appear to be an effective way of predicting the effect deliberation will have on the initial set of references. A problem however is that the assumptions of the leniency bias could be explained by the fact that most of the data was collected using students, and it has been shown by Simon and Mahan (1971) (as cited in MacCoun and Kerr, 1988). In an attempt to remedy this as an explanation for the leniency bias, MacCoun and Kerr (1988) conducted a further experiment where student decision making processes were compared to those of the general public. They did not find student juries to be more lenient. In this comparison however, MacCoun and Kerr (1988) only compared student and general public juries consisting of four members. It may have been that four members was not enough to really allow the deliberation process to generate results showing that students were more lenient.
