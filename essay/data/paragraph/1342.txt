The results of such experiments have been seen to vary from person to person. For the last several decades, research focused on the individual rather than on the group as a whole (Guerin, 1982). An individual's fear of evaluation or performance anxiety emerged to explain why the mere presence of others affects performance (Dippold, 1924; Carver and Scheier, 1981; Ashby et al., 1950). Results of experiments such as these have enabled research to gain a greater understanding of the complex and privileged nature of individual behaviour (Guerin and Innes, 1982; Bond 1982; Clement Z, 1984). One concern is that the effects of social facilitation vary from study to study. While in some cases, it leads to improved performance (Triplett 1898; Allport 1920) in others, it has been shown to lead to worse performance (Schmitt, Gilovich, Goore, Josepha 1986; Robinson Staveley and Cooper, 1990). It has been suggested that this is because social facilitation tends to occur only with certain types of tasks, and therefore not with others (Baron 1986). Furthermore, even if the presence of others leads to improved performance, this is not always consistent (Henrich, Stich and Mark, 1991; Markus, 1978). The reasons for this could be that the presence of others can stimulate other underlying forces; forces that are not to do with performance, but rather with the effect of the presence of the other participants. This is an important aspect to bear in mind when considering the hypotheses of this experiment.
