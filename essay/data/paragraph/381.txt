The aim of the experiment was to establish the order of a number of genes important in amino acid metabolism and sugar catabolism. Using conjugation, pieces of As this occurs in a linear fashion in one direction, the mating pairs were broken apart at time intervals and plated. The plates were incubated for a week and from the appearance of the different number of colonies, the order of the gene transfer for the
