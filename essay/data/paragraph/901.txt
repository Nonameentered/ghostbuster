Our emotions are very often entwined with the memories they provoke; whether a particular memory is encoded strongly and in detail, or is repressed, is often dependant on the emotion associated with it. As Eysenck and Keane (2000) note, "there are undoubtedly cases in which emotionally charged material is better remembered than neutral material". In addition, our present emotional state will also influence the memories we retrieve and so can also affect the remembering of emotional events from the past.
