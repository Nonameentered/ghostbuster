This study investigated whether first year university females had significantly more disordered eating than a control group of non-university females. It was hypothesised that low self esteem as a result of leaving home for the first time, and having to integrate a new peer group would be the cause of this. Questionnaires were used to measure participants eating behaviour, body shape satisfaction and self esteem. Attitudes towards the new peer group were measured using specific questions on the self esteem questionnaire. It was found that the first year students did have significantly more disordered eating than the control group, although having low self esteem and integrating a new peer group were not significant causes of this. It may be that low self esteem and having to integrate a new peer group play a part in increasing eating deviancy in first year students, although these may not have been shown to be significant because they combine with other factors associated with university life such as stress and depression. It was clearly found, however, that first year females have far more problems with their eating than females who are not at university.
