We now turn to the factors that, in some eyes, have made class irrelevant to historical analysis, starting with Postmodernism. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, defeat of organised labour, the fall of great Victorian staple industries, redundancy of Trade Unions and recrudescence of the New Right, scholars began to rethink the meaning of past verities. These changing dimensions had struck a fatal blow to the class politics of the Left, confirmed in the Thatcher electoral victories in 1979, 1983 and 1987. To Postmodernists, even the Miners' strike of the 1980s has more to do with the effect on community life, rather than traditional direct class struggle. Whereas for Marx, class was the essence of history, for the Thatcherite New Right, class was its perversion and they sought a 'classless society'. Postmodernists claim that the world today is no more than a global triumph of free market economies and pluralistic democracies, thereby bringing the old metanarratives, such as class, to their knees. Indeed, J F Lyotard opined that class had been 'blurred to the point of losing all radicality' However, the license for the blanket repudiation of class on these grounds is weak.
