1. Turbocharger - An apparatus to boost the horsepower of engine without significantly increased its weight, operated by pressurizing the air flowing into the engine's cylinders in order to get more fuel to be burnt during each stroke. Advantage of compressing the air was more air could be squeezed into a cylinder, hence more fuel could be added and more power could be obtained from each explosion in each cylinder. More overall power could be produced than the same engine without the charging (Figure 7).
