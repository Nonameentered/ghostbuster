Conjugation and Recombination are mechanisms of exchange of genetic material between bacteria. Conjugation is a mating process that involves two bacterial cells forming a mating pair and transferring genetic material through contact between the two cells. Recombination is the process by which genes from the two bacteria are exchanged during mating. In terms of bacteria, recombination occurs on the DNA level where either homologous chromosomal DNA is exchanged or segments of DNA are exchanged which can lead to gene rearrangements and new allele combinations.
