The acquisition of Midland Metro would not be as risky a business manoeuvre for reasons detailed in the previous section. My recommendation is that, if you are to either set up a new business in competition with the Midland Metro or attempt an acquisition of that company, then an acquisition would be the best strategy. Irrespective of the decision to purchase Midland Metro or establish a competitor, a cost leadership strategy would be most appropriate.
