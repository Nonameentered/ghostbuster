Milgram on the other hand had a very dissimilar experiment set up to Zimbardo's experiment. Milgram placed his subjects under a certain situation for only a short period of less than an hour whereas Zimbardo's subjects were placed in a make-shirt prison for a considerably longer period of 6 days. Milgram's obedience study was carried out to measure to what degree people would obey an authoritative figure in the light of a moral dilemma. The sample for the experiment was chosen from a newspaper advertisement. It must be noted that the participants were clearly informed that they were paid the money just for appearing at the laboratory, and they were free to leave at anytime without forfeiting the money. A stern looking male experimenter was used and a mild mannered man played the part of the victim. The subject was placed as the teacher in a rigged draw. The teacher reads a list of word pairs which the learner has to learn. The teacher then tests the learner and if a wrong answer is given, the electric voltage would be increased.
