In conjugation, an F pilus from the donor is used to anchor a recipient to form a mating pair. The Fertility or F factor, which is present in the donor but not in the recipient (F-), was transferred through this pilus. Bacterial strains with the F factor integrated in their chromosomes are referred to as High Frequency Donor (Hfr) strains as they are capable of high efficiency chromosome transfer. The F factor in integrated in different positions and in different orientations in different Hfr strains. As the Hfr donate the chromosome in one direction, the orientation determines the direction of chromosome donations from the Hfr strain, starting at the F factor integration site. The distance between genes is related to the time between their transfer, thus the map of an
