Milgram on the other hand had a different hypothesis and focus. His study was inspired by the many atrocities that had been committed in the Second World War. Many culprits put on trial at the end of the war used the chief defence that they had been following orders from somebody above. It was of popular opinion that there was something intrinsic in the German character that made them particularly cruel. That was a dispositional view that people are genetically determined and a person's genetic makeup was the influence behind their acting in a certain fashion. This view was questioned and disputed by Milgram. He inferred that most people, regardless of nationality, could perform inhuman acts upon another, under certain circumstances. Milgram reasoned that people could commit atrocities when they are given orders by an authority.
