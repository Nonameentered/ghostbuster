The experiment was conducted using the standard method of haemagglutination. First, the dilution of the virus was done according to the standard method and each dilution mixed with 2% (v/v) of a 2% suspension of guinea pig red blood cells (RBCs). The undiluted virus stock was added to the first 2% RBCs and each subsequent well was 1/2 (2-fold) dilutions of the previous well. This was done to find the end point of the virus, which was a dilution at which there was only a slight agglutination. This was repeating twice and read after one minute. The dilution at which there was a slight agglutination was taken as 1 HA unit and the titre of HA was determined.  The HI titre was done in similar manner. The virus was diluted to produce a virus suspension containing approximately 160 HA units/ml. This solution was mixed with 50 The first control (C1) contained 100 The second control (C2) contained 100 The third control (C3) contained 100 To the last control (C4), only 100 All the X and Y wells contain 100 The HI titre was also determined similarly. All the X and Y wells were mixed with 2% suspension of guinea pig RBCs and read after one minute. The concentration at which there was no HA inhibition was taken as 1 HI unit and the HI titre of the antiserum was determined.  Results
