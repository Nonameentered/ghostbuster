In his account of how the convict code is to be interpreted, Wieder emphasises how it obtains a indexical status. Rather like the coding system of books in a library, its norms serve to interpret rather than to describe it. Thus, norms serve as a tacit justification of real events, for both social actors and the sociologist. A truer account of events, is, however, more complicated. By accepting norms as motivation and authentic drives of social actors, the convict code came to serve as a tool of rendering behaviour logical and coherent. For staff, this tool justified an acceptance of nonconformist behaviour from the residents' side, while the residents often successfully manipulated it to their direct advantage. This underlying differentiation reveals the political and arbitrary nature of social norms, however developed and "theory-laden". In his approach to sociology, Wieder, and the wider school of ethnomethodologists, build upon the work of phenomenology and existentialism to show the inescapability of situational variables in the everyday context of social interaction. Thus, the "what" of social norms must separated from the "how" of interpretation, and subsequently analysed at a different level. This approach, however, has not remained uncriticised. Many sociologists deem the extent of manipulative power that ethnomethodologists award the individual with unrealistic. According to them, behaviour is more context-bound and can be seen to be derived from this context. In that case, Wieder's account of the convict code serves, foremostly, as an existential reminder of the forces underlying our everyday commonsense social interaction. .
