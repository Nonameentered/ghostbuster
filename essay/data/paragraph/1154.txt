The validity of the f-scale has come under question a number of times. Even though research suggests that the f-scale does not measure what it sets out to measure, it does measure something that seems to have a significant effect on many other variables (Ray, 1990). Gabennesch (1972) suggested that a high f score represents narrowness of world-view and a narrow breadth of perspective.
