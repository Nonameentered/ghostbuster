This demonstrates the strength of this popular movement, and how dangerous it was for the Bolsheviks. The Greens imposed a wartime structure upon the rural districts of Russia, by having their own committees and national armies. Things were worse for the Bolsheviks because there were Red Forest Brothers, peasants who had willingly entered the Red Army but still adhered to the cause of the Greens, thus weakening the Reds from the inside. The Greens had numerous spokesmen, such as the SR's, who had a huge following and could manipulate the people to oppose the Bolsheviks.
