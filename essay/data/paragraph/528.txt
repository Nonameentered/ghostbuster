The next phase (the retardation phase) is a reflection of the gradual depletion of available nutrients, which slows the cell growth. The rate of growth at this point also decreases as some of the cells stop growing before others until all of the cells stop growing and the absorbance remains constant i.e. the stationary phase. This is shown in section five of our graph on the additional page.
