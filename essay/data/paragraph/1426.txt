The exceedance curve is based on the information from the Ystwyth (Figure 1), scaled down by the differences in catchment area and rainfall. As a result, it is assumed this is a realistic representation of the stream at Nick's location. Table 2 is compiled from this exceedance curve. Power output The Turgo turbine that Nick uses has a maximum power output of 3.4kW with open sprint water. It is estimated by the turbine ratings (Table 3) that this turbine can produce 5.4 kWh/hour at this maximum flow rate. This is the maximum power this turbine is capable of producing.
