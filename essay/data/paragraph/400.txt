From table 1, the 7 The first well is a 10-fold dilution, and the second well is a 20-fold dilution and the third well is a 40-fold dilution, therefore the seventh well is a 640-fold dilution of the original virus stock. Refer to the appendix for calculations. From table 2, the 6 As the 6 Refer to the appendix for calculations and the method for the contents of each well. As antibody Y did not inhibit agglutination of RBC, it is not the antibody for the virus provided. Therefore the virus was concluded as influenza A virus as it was known that antibody X contains the antiserum for influenza A virus. The amount of virus just able to agglutinate a fixed number of RBCs is defined as 1HA of virus and at the end points (refer to table 1 and 2), there is a virus concentration of 1 HA units/ml. The end points were clearly observed in table 1 (7 If there were too many virus present, agglutination would take place and the whole well would be almost homogenously red. If too little or no virus were present, the RBCs will settle to the bottom of the well resulting in a bright pink/red spot at the bottom of the well. If little or no antibody is present, it will behave the same as the presence of numerous viruses and a homogenous red well would be observed. In the HA assay, the 7 This is shown in well 7 of table 1. From this, the original stock was calculated to contain 6400 HA units of virus/ml and therefore had 2.88 x 10 In the HI assay, the 6 This is shown in well 6 of X rows of table 2. Since antibody Y did not prevent the agglutination of RBCs, the virus was concluded as not being para influenza virus Type 3. In the 6
