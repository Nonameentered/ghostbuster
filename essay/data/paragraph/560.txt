Following transplantation, the diabetic mice were observed and monitored for lower levels of blood glucose. It was found that the transplanted mice required only one third the amount of exogenous insulin required when compared with non-transplanted mice and developed normal fasting and post-prandial glucose levels (12). Such findings provide evidence for the potential of ES cell-derived insulin-producing cells for transplantation in the treatment of diabetes. Furthermore, exploitation of stem cells may also be useful in the development of novel drugs to treat diabetes. Many of the treatments currently used such as the sulfonylureas inhibit extra-islet channels, often with general side effects. If ES-derived cells were to be used in drug discovery, it is possible to test hundreds of compounds on the same population, thus increasing the chances of developing a safe and specific agent. This method of drug discovery has already been successfully used in novel treatments of other disease such as Alzheimer's and by ES-engineered cells being used in the same way, scientists may soon come up with a much safer insulin replacement therapy for diabetes.
