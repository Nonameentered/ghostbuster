About the type of people, I can say the following. On the first floor, there was a majority of women among the customers. Most of them I guessed were over forty years of age. Interestingly, between the two floors there seemed to be something of a difference between the types of customers. Generally, customers downstairs were younger of age, and they spent less time in the shop. Moreover, the customers downstairs seemed to be more reactive to other customers. They seemed, perhaps, less accustomed to the unwritten rules of the 'bookshop etiquette'. What underlines this mode of thinking, also, is the method of classifying the books it offers. Children's books, bestsellers, as well as popular scientific books, are all on offer on the ground floor, while some books were displayed on tables on the ground floor, as well as on shelves at the top floor. Although at first it may appear inefficient and chaotic to place one book in two places in the store, we must look for an explanation to it.
