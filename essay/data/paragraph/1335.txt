A shift in primary science teaching format does seem to be imminent, however. Shayer and Adey (1981), identify a struggle in organising which concepts should be taught to children, and when they should be taught to them, in order to best promote learning by corresponding with their level of cognitive ability. This observation has been supported by Clark and Kamii (1993). The findings of such research may call for a regression to the old science curriculum, which focused more on subject-specific knowledge. Shayer and Adhami (2003), report a survey which showed that less than 20% of the population, by the end of their adolescence, had reached the cognitive level considered normal by Piaget. Houde (2000), too, deems the structural progression of cognitive development too simplistic, and calls for the reappraisal of the teaching format in primary schools.
