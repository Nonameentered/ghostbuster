This essay will focus upon the reasons why women have had children and those that chose to remain voluntarily childless. It will look at the way in which social, economic and personal factors become intertwined with culture and discourses relating to reproduction in order for women to decide upon their reproductive choices. I will start by looking at the decision to have children and how complex a notion it is when one considers the influences that are at play.
