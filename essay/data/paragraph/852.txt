Evidence of human ability to create neural mechanisms in order to use the information from the fourth photopsin is not as conclusive as evidence from new world monkeys as it is not possible to use microspectrophotometer techniques. Behavioural evidence has illustrated some possible cases of full tetrachromacy however. Jordan and Mollen (1993) asked heterozygous carries of anomalous trichromacy and trichromatic controls to adjust a mixture of green and orange light, and yellow and red light, to obtain a match. They found no significant difference in behaviour between the two groups, suggesting either that this is not a sensitive enough measure of tetrachromacy, or that people may carry four wavelength sensitive cones, but cannot actually use them due to the structure of the brain. Jordan and Mollen (1993) did find one person however, who they label as cDa7, who found only one combination of the two mixtures that would give a match. The other trichromatic controls and the heterozygous carriers had a greater variability in the repeated responses they gave on the ratio matching tasks, whereas cDa7 repeatedly gave the same response. This implies that she had greater ability to distinguish between the colours to gain a precise match and therefore her visual system was using tetrachromatic vision as opposed to the extra, shifted cone not being utilised.
