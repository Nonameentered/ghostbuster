It must also be said that the drive and motivation of the party to stay in power and be the most feared organisation must come from the top. The pivotal role of the Fuhrer towards the party can be seen in the close interaction between himself, Joseph Goebbels and the other important party member, such as Himmler and Bormann. ' This clearly reflects the right-hand man attitude of the party members, as if they were expecting the Fuhrer to make the final decisions, and that the various acts of violence were committed due to threats of the 'literal vengeance' of the Fuhrer himself. Thus, we see that Adolf Hitler was not so much content to remain in an undefined position of power as a symbol, but rather, he was actively involved in the pursuit of power through domineering the party. Furthermore, 'Hitler was a dictator with a strong attachment to ritual; his entourage had to demonstrate its loyalty and obedience through acts of servility, never losing sight of the Fuhrer's central role." However, due to the nature of his 'charismatic rule', the exact degree of power he wielded was open to interpretation. Hence, the power struggles with his underlings could never once and for all be settled, since the Fuhrer always has the power of veto, but 'this powerless power'-in-flux seemed to reinforce the chaotic atmosphere which was inherent in the Third Reich.
