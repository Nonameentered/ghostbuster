Heterozygous females have two different types of red opsin; one is the one that is found in trichromats, serine (with an absorption maxima of 557nm) and the other is alanine (with an absorption maxima of 552nm). If these two types of red opsin exist then it is possible for a female to have four wavelength specific cones and therefore theoretically be a tetrachromat. It can be concluded that these heterozygous females have the genetic propensity to be tetrachromatic, but this does not mean that she is actually a tetrachromat. This is because in the condition of trichromacy it has been found that even though an extra fourth photopsin can be produced it is only expressed in half the retinal cells (Jordan and Mollen, 1993), meaning that even though females have the potential to be tetrachromat they are not as they are normally suppressed and only express trichromatic cones through one x chromosome, either through chance or through selection.
