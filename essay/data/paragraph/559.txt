The second milestone in the preparation for stem cell transplantation in the treatment of diabetes was achieved in 2000 when former ES lines were implanted into diabetic mice and demonstrated to reduce, and in some cases even completely normalized, the mice's blood glucose levels (12) This potential cure was tested in mice several times in various ways. The most successful way was shown in Figure 5 in which three day-old neonatal mice suffering from type 1 diabetes were injected with between 107 and 1010 ES cells that had been directed to differentiate to form insulin-producing cells. Mice receiving ten times this dose (1010) showed normal blood glucose levels for more than forty days (McKay as referenced in 12). The process was repeated in adult type one diabetic mice and the results demonstrated that the control of diabetes and the effects of insulin was much improved when ES cells were used. As a result, approval was extended in England shortly after this series of research experiments, to allow the use of ES cells in the treatment of early onset diabetes.
