The scale has also been described as a collection of 'Victorian values' (Hartmann, 1977); the attitudes were considered old-fashioned even when the f-scale was complied. Therefore we are unable to be sure if the scale is even socially relevant to today's society. What is considered as an authority personality type may not be applicable to today's culture either. In the 20's, obedience to authority was the norm and was actually expected of children. However, now, children are encouraged to be more autonomous. Therefore if someone were to score highly on the f-scale it could just mean that they are old fashioned and not authoritarian. Sanford (1977) suggested that due to changing times, interested researchers should attempt to define a new from of authoritarian personality that is related more to current social issues.
