The history of empires is a long one: beginning with the Greek, Roman and Persian empires, which pitted race against race; the empires of Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands and Britain in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, which saw the rivalry between monarchies; and finally, the 'New' Imperialism of the mid-nineteenth century, which saw a renewed interest in and frantic scramble for, new colonies, between nation-states. 'By early twentieth century, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, and Portugal together held sway over almost 84 percent of the earth's surface." Imperialism had become not only fashionable, but also defined the era from the mid-nineteenth onwards to World War I. Despite many attempts to attach priority to a certain aspect of imperialism as being the driving force behind the phenomenon, it is perhaps more helpful to understand it as a product of a complex web of motives and concerns. Also, imperialism must be examined in the context of its time (post-enlightenment ideas, rapid industrialisation, the formation of scientific theories which supported the superiority of one race over another, nationalism, and the economic depression of 1873), without which, the phenomenon either would not have occurred, or might have taken on a different form.
