Recent research has shown that a baby's knowledge of objects is more sophisticated than what Piaget initially assumed. Baillargeon et al (1985), proposed a very early acquisition of object permanence. 5-month-old infants were habituated to a screen that moved back and forth, in the manner of a drawbridge. The infants were then shown either a possible event where the screen reached an occluded box and stopped, or an impossible event where the screen moved straight through the space occupied by the box. It was found that these infants understood that the box continued to exist even after the screen occluded it and expected the screen to stop against the box, as they looked longer and showed surprise at the impossible event. It was therefore believed that although an infant does not have an innate knowledge of object permanence, they are born with some form of an innate knowledge of how objects behave (Baillargeon et al., 1985). Despite these findings, infants still failed to actively search for the hidden objects (Piaget's main criterion for object permanence). According to Baillargeon et al (1985), this was purely due to physical limitations, such as a lack of motor coordination. Therefore it may be more reasonable to suggest that infants have a rudimentary understanding of object permanence at a very young age, but are unable to act upon it until their motor skills are more coordinated. This idea, has in turn, been criticised by other experiments which have ruled out the possibility of a lack of motor skill (Meltzoff & Moore, 1999) and thus proposed that failure in the experiment is due to incomplete object permanence; hence, even at 14 months, we are still not seeing a fully developed notion of object permanence. In light of recent research, it is clear that object permanence is definitely not innate, especially due to evidence suggesting it can only be attained after an infant develops its knowledge of time and space (Baillargeon et al., 1985).
