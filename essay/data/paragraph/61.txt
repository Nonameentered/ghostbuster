One of the groups most affected by these changes was the young, and Makeham claims that they are now especially vulnerable to general trends in employment (1980, cited in Coles, 1995, p 32). In 1960 the unemployment rate for the under 25s was only 2.4%, however by 1979 it had increased to 12.2% and by 1981 it had risen further to 21.4% (Coles, 1995, p32). This trend is one that still continues today, and in 1996, half a million 19-24 year olds were classified as unemployed (Jones and Novak, 1999, p64). These statistics can further be placed in context by looking at the fact that although general unemployment was rising at the time, which could simply be reflected in these figures, it only rose by 45%, whereas youth unemployment rose by 120% (Coles, 1995, p32).
