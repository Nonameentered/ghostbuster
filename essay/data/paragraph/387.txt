Graph 1 was drawn on a semi-log scale and it was observed that the absorbance increases with time for both the donor and the recipient strains. Lines of best fit were drawn for the exponential phase (from 20min onwards) for both cultures. The absorbance values for 60min (for both the donor and recipient strains) were not included as they were the only points out of norm. From 0 to 20min, the cultures were at the lag phase and thus the increase in absorbance was not huge. The absorbance values then increase sharply, exponential phase. The donor culture was transferred to the recipient culture and the absorbance was measured and was plated and taken as time 0. The culture was plated at time intervals (0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120 min) and the growth for each quadrant was shown in table 3 below.
