While this links humanism and reformation, the exact relation between the two originated much earlier. Already in antiquity, scholasticism had stressed the importance of the classical Latin language for the proper transmission of religious dogmas and usage of ecclesiastical rituals. It was this scholarly legacy that the humanists of Cologne and Leipzig were quick to adopt in order to modify the religious tradition and thereby modernise the liturgy. This included a shift to sermon-style orations, and the introduction of more refined Latin in religious theoretical works. Critics have argued that it was this same tendency which fixed the inspiration for a reformation within the minds of an entire generation of readers and listeners.
