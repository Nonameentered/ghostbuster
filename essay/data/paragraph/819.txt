The results show that first year university students do have significantly more disordered eating behaviours than their non-university counterparts. Integrating a new peer group and having low self esteem did not, however, prove to be significant. It is likely that low self esteem and having to integrate a new peer group absolutely play a part in triggering disordered eating in first year students, although these were not shown to be significant due to them joining with other factors such as depression and stress which are associated with university life.
