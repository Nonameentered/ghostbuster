This may have implications for female more than males as it has been suggested by a number of authors that females are more likely to become depressed because of lack of friends due to the importance girls place on friendships (as cited in Asher, 1990). This brings attention to evolutionary driven gender differences. Hir sch (1974) (as cited in David, 1990) suggests that females are the ones who invest the most in relationships because of the impact they have on survival and reproductive success, as well as the important role of attachments in development of the child. This may mean girls may be more sensitive to social rejection and therefore more likely to suffer from depression and other psychological difficulties come adolescence. This is especially important to take into account because the rate of depression in girls between the ages of 10 and 12 is two to three times that of boys and is likely to continue throughout adulthood. (David, 1990).
