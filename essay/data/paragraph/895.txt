Similarly, the Russians were able to cope with chaos and turn a disaster into a victory. This is illustrated by the evacuation of the factories to Russia's industrial hinterland. They had the capacity to achieve maximum production at minimum primary resources. This was due to the government's centralised planning. The government organised the entire economy in order to create military power. 'The government's control gave people the ability to respond and the power to dispose of any natural and human resource present in the country." This is evidence of the powerful government measures helping the war effort.
