In conclusion, it has been found that semantically related speech presented as an auditory source can impair short term memory of word lists presented visually. These results support the predicted outcome and can be used as evidence for the working memory model and the phonological loop, (Baddeley, 1992), suggesting that working memory has limited resources for semantic processing. The findings may also have relevance within areas of learning and memory.
