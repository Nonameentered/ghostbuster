We are using a circuit with four active bridges. Providing that they are correctly connected into the bridge, so that one opposite pair (e.g. R R This bridge also compensates for changes in gauge resistance due to temperature. For metal gauges the effect of temperature is to multiply each gauge resistance by the factor 1 + T; which cancels out in the above voltage equation, as those gauges in tension will have their resistance increased by a temperature change and those in compression will have theirs decreased.
