The young age at which children are being entered into primary education, coupled with the rapid developments being made by cognitive research (Oschner and Lieberman, 2002), indicates that it may be necessary to alter the way in which children are taught. The main focus of this essay is to explore whether research into the cognitive development of specific concepts of primary school aged children can feasibly be incorporated into the science curriculum, so that the correct scientific concepts are taught at the correct time. It is also to examine whether this method of teaching could be a more appropriate alternative to the Piagetian, age-centric, domain general learning approach.
