It is furthermore interesting to note that the store succeeds to a high degree to create an optimal consumer atmosphere. There is little talking, people who intend to stay for a longer period easily find their way in search for their category of books, and the first floor, by concealing the street and placing the salon tables and couch, create an atmosphere where people can stay longer without being disturbed. It is likely that the customers recognise and reinforce aspects of this way of thinking. This is shown by the fact that people search for books by themselves, even if they enter the shop as part of a group. Other evidence is the maintenance of the 'polite distance' of which I spoke earlier. It is evident that consumerism decides to a high degree what forms of social interaction are accepted, and which not. In this, there is no great difference of interest between personnel and customer.
