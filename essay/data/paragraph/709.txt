The case of Cambodian genocide raises the example of massacre on a much broader, more national scale, and this form of massacre can be found elsewhere in the twentieth century- most notably in Nanking, China, during World War Two. As Callum Macdonald notes, in December 1937 'Japanese troops embarked on an orgy of murder, rape, arson and looting which lasted over six weeks' Similarly, in Cambodia whereas Pol Pot appeared to be attacking minorities, the massacre as a whole was a general ambush upon those that did not conform to the ideals of the communist party. This involved the slaughter of nearly 3000 Buddhists, 215,000 Chinese, 12000 Thai, and 'the Vietnamese community...was entirely eradicated' The Muslim Chams were also targeted for, like the cases of Armenia and the Holocaust, 'their distinct religion, language and culture, large villages and autonomous networks threatened the atomized, closely supervised society that the Pol Pot leadership planned' However this threat extended to all the aforementioned groups within Cambodia and became more of a national assault like the Japanese rape of Nanking. The only significant point that establishes Nanking as different in motive, though, is that it was an inter-national hostility that led to massacre (like in Bosnia). In Cambodia, Armenia and the Holocaust, massacre was derived from the respective government initiatives to impress their regime and ideals upon their country.
