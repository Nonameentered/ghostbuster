However, there has been much debate over whether what we are seeing is in fact true imitation and not just some form of conditioning. In previous research, examiners have been found to alter their rhythm of tongue protrusions as a function of the infant's response, thus encouraging the possibility for conditioned imitation. To rule out this factor, Meltzoff & Moore's (1977) experiment ensured that examiners were unaware that they were testing imitation and blind judges were used to label the newborns' expressions. Each newborn was shown four gestures in a random order for 15 seconds and it was found that 12-21 day old babies imitated both facial and manual gestures during a 20 second response period. Despite this, some research has proposed that imitation is merely an innate releasing mechanism (Lorenz & Tinbergen, 1938, as cited in Meltzoff & Moore, 1977) where these response gestures are just fixed action patterns released by a corresponding adult gesture. However, the evidence that newborns imitated four different gestures and that a child's imitative behaviour is not always consistent refutes this claim.
