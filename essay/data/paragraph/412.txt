The mitochondria was the first symbiotic event during the prokaryote-eukaryote transition and this is why they are considered as the first organelle to evolve from prokaryotes, by endosymbiotic theory. Chloroplast and hydrogenosomes, however, are thought to arise from further serial endosymbiosis, for example, mitochondria-containing eukaryotes engulfed photosynthesising prokaryotes to become chloroplast containing protoctists, and anaerobic protoctists acquired fermentative prokaryotes, to become hydrogenosomes containing anaerobes
