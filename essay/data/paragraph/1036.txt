The social functions that are fulfilled by memorial building can be quite diverse. On the one hand, it is useful for consensus building: 'in the absence of shared belief or common interests, Art in public spaces may force an otherwise fragmented populace to frame diverse values and ideals in common spaces. By creating common spaces for memory, monuments propagate the illusion of common memory." On the other hand, memorials relieve the population of the burden to remember, 'under the illusion that our memorial edifices will always be there to remind us, we take leave of them and return only at our own convenience." Despite the various facets of remembrance, there is a general consensus that monuments are meant for public consumption, and hence, a part of the answer to the question of how the Holocaust should be memorialised would rest on public opinion and expectations.
