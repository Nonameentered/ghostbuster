Hitler's 'charismatic rule' worked to the benefit of the regime initially, when the conditions were favourable, and the success that was much desired was obtained. Entry into World War II was inevitable for the survival of the system that inherently thrived on dynamism and periods of emergency, but it was a double-edged sword, in that failure of the war effort would surely bring the Nazi dictatorship to its knees, and it did. As the war started going badly, 'the tide of Hitler's popularity first waned rather slowly, then ebbed sharply-a decline accelerating after Stalingrad, when Hitler's personal responsibility for the catastrophe was widely recognised." Even the tool of propaganda could not erase the fallibility of the Fuhrer in the eyes of the people, instead, it made the population even more distrustful of the system that they had come to doubt. Therefore, the writer would conclude that ultimately, Hitler's 'charismatic rule' weakened the Third Reich as a dictatorship, due to the innately destructive elements in this concept of legitimacy.
