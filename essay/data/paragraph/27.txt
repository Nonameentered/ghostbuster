I will begin by looking at one of the most important implications; women's exclusion from medicine. In previous centuries health care tended to be carried out by female lay-healers within the community (Witz, 1992). Female lay-healers were valued members of the community and as a result gained high status. They cared for the sick and elderly, and were also relied upon to produce drugs and remedies for their patients (Moscucci, 1990). As females were seen as closer to the earth it was felt that they were most suited to carrying out the role of carer within the community, however medicine slowly began to develop as a form of science, rather than an occupation relating to nature, and male domination of the occupation began.
