Many studies have shown that newborns have a strong preference to human voices, n particular, their mothers voice (DeCasper & Fifer, 1980), and sounds that generally, fall within the same frequency range as the human voice (Alegria & Noirot, 1978). The reason for these intrinsic preferences could be attributed to the fact that even from within the womb we are exposed to auditory knowledge. DeCasper & Fifer, (1980) showed that babies establish their preferences inside the womb, implying an innate tendency to choose. Shortly after delivery, infants with very little maternal exposure were taught that by sucking on a non-nutritive nipple during a tone period their mothers voice would appear and sucking during a no-tone period would produce a non-maternal voice. It was found that the probability of sucking was significantly higher during tone periods, indicating a preference for the maternal voice. Further research has verified the significance of pre-natal exposure. Foetuses have shown a decrease in heart rate when played a tape of their mother reading a rhyme that had previously been read to them. This suggests that a foetus's exposure to specific speech sounds can affect their consecutive reactions to those sounds (DeCasper et al., 1994) and can promote language-relevant perceptual tuning even prior to birth.
