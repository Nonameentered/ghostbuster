Despite these concerns, research on social facilitation has been extremely extensive and well supported. It is the pioneering work on the topic, as well as research on evaluation apprehension and mere presence effects that has given impetus to this study. One element of this phenomenon has received surprisingly little empirical attention - how many people are required to make a difference on the individual's performance. Though it is known an effect is definitely produced, the aim of this research was to uncover what actually makes performance change. Triplett's studies on competition may have yielded different results if the children were paired not only with one other child, but with three, four or five more children. This experiment aims to investigate the effects of social facilitation on three different group sizes in order to determine how many people are necessary for social facilitation to have an effect. Much research on the mere presence effect has suggested that the presence of another is all that is needed in order to affect performance. We wanted to examine the very crux of social facilitation theories, specifically at which point the element of competition and the influence of others arises, how this varies as a function of group size, and what exactly is involved in asserting the affects that are asserted. The aim of this study is to attend more specifically to the phenomenon of competitiveness via theories of social facilitation, and to discover how many people are necessary to produce such effects.
