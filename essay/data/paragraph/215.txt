The dichotomy between modern, individualist liberalism and the Rousseauean state lies predominantly in their different interpretations of liberty. Whereas the former stress the lack of protection for the individual in Rousseau's social contract, Rousseau in turn entertains concerns with the crude, unsocial kind of liberty that individualists profess. Rather does he see liberty in a community best exercised at the highest level, thus enhancing liberty in an ordered way. As liberty exercised only on the most individual, narrow level only furthers contradiction in interests, Rousseau proposes the pursuit of community interest, which, if carried out fully, secures the welfare and safety of all its citizens. What Rousseau does not display enough attention to, however, was the fact that 'there is never a perfect fit between moral requirements of our rational nature and requirements of citizenship'. Rousseau, on the contrary, believes in the stabilising role of the general will, and the inalienability of the will in general. The problem, nonetheless, lies with the radical solution Rousseau's general will poses. Asserting that '[t]o be governed by appetite alone is slavery, while obedience to a law one prescribes to oneself is freedom', Thus, a community taking its legislative task to the extreme, might indeed force its citizens into abide by the law. The question becomes, then, not to what extent Rousseau can be used for totalitarian ends, which he explicitly sets out to prevent, but rather how a feasible system may be envisaged in which particular interpretations of the general good can obtain a stable construct in which the individual is both more protected and better positioned to criticise the state's pursuit of the general good.
