For too long the history of the Cold War has been written from a 'top-down' perspective examining elites and decision-makers. Whilst political scientists have become mired in using rational International Relations models, historians have rarely cast their net beyond realpolitik, frequently falling foul of detailed narrative around contingencies which often never occurred. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the 30-year rule for many documents in the West, which both led to a spate of archival-based sources available to historians, cemented this diplomatic and empirical approach. Moreover, archival work alone is a dangerous place from which to survey the Cold War, since both sides of the Iron Curtain employed 'newspeak' rather than rational discourse, even behind closed doors. In short, this 'New Cold War history' can become overly narrative driven and blind to broader analysis. However, as a result of the growing interest in cultural history following the 1980s 'linguistic turn', recent study, particularly in the so called 'Constructivist' school, has challenged Cold War historians to spread their wings methodologically, and explore the culture of the conflict. In spite of noteworthy 'hot' episodes, such as Vietnam, the Cold War was in most part a conflict of words and images delivered to an audience soaked in its products.
