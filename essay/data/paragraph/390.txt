As the recipient strain gained the genes containing the ability to grow in the absence of a specific nutrient in the selective media, growth would be observed on the plate, depending the time of the gene transfer. This ability is due to the presence of genes capable of synthesising the absent nutrient. From the results section, the order of genes established was: threonine (plate 6), arginine (plate 1), xylose (plate 7), isoleucine and valine (plate 3), leucine (plate 4), proline (plate 5) and histidine (plate 2). A more precise method is required to obtain a fine structure mapping of the chromosome, such as restriction enzyme treatment of the total DNA. The gene order can be confirmed by using different donor strains, or
