The Story Board Model of jury decision making proposes that in order for jurors to understand the vast and complex body of evidence presented at trials, they need to interpret the evidence in a way that makes sense to them. (Pennington and Hastie, 1992). In order to do this the juror imposes a narrative structure on the evidence to create a story. This story then acts as causal model to allow the jurors to interpret the evidence in a context from which they can draw their own experiences and evaluations, whilst allowing them to perceive the evidence as a coherent mental representation (Pennington and Hastie, 1992). Stories are created from schemas which are composed from experiences and preconceptions held by the individual and built up over a life time, it is through these that the facts of the case can take on their different meanings (Holstein, 1985). People can create completely different stories for the same evidence which is where the Story Board Model has implications for the deliberation process, as these many individual stories have to be integrated into one, often unanimous, verdict. Unfortunately the majority of research on the Story Board Model does not focus upon how this final verdict is created and concentrates upon how the initial individual pre deliberation verdict is reached. This research will be considered however as inferences can be drawn as to how this might impact upon the deliberation process.
