The next problem is linked to validity. Official statistics go through a long process of decision making before the final result is reached (Hindess, 1973, May, 1997), even down to what methodology is used, and this process can alter the results greatly. In The first decision in the process here is that of what is a crime in terms of the law. This would have a huge impact on crime statistics, for example if marital rape was not illegal then the crime statistics of rape would be very different. The second decision is made by the victim of the crime; whether to report it or not, which means that the formation of official statistics is not just influenced by those composing them, but also by decisions made by those involved in the actual area (May, 1997).
