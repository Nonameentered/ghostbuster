However, there are also economic and social reasons that influence this decision. Through employment women are becoming increasingly financially independent, meaning that they can bear the economic burden of child rearing without entering into marriage (Gillespie, 2001). Consequently this can mean that having children does not often mean economic gain, unlike previously when employers would give promotions to those with children, and there is evidence to suggest that this may have an impact upon fertility rates (Andorka, 1978).
