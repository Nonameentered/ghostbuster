In conclusion, this fascination that the Occident had for the Oriental luxury goods was not new, but was closely entwined with the captivating medieval myth of Cathay, and reached new dimensions in the seventeenth and eighteenth century with the establishment of the East India Companies (which were themselves the product of and the further stimulus to the West-East trade born of the Occidental preoccupation with the exotic, mysterious and abundant East) and the creation of European markets for Chinese luxury goods (which was previously the preserve of the European royalty). It is perhaps paradoxical that these Chinese luxury goods fascinate precisely because they have been displaced from their original cultures and grafted into new ones, but continue to give the impression that it was still possible to use them as prisms through which the West can subscribe to notions of Chinese refinement and skill. The fascination for anything 'Chinese' is apparent in the vogue for the Chinoiserie especially in the eighteenth century, and is both reflective of, and contributed to the existing enthrallment that the West had for the East, and how that affected the dominant taste in Europe. The appeal of Chinese luxury goods was also played up by the East India Companies which capitalised on the vogue for Chinoiserie, and created new wants through the successful marketing technique of making the foreign 'relevant' to the West through customisation. Finally, and most importantly, Chinese luxury goods were seen as having the role of "awakening the imagination" Despite being so far removed from their original cultures, that these luxury goods were relevant and fulfilled certain functions given to them by their European possessors accounts to a large extent for the fascination that seventeenth and eighteenth century Europeans had for Chinese luxury goods.
