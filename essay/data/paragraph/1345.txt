Methods  Participants  Sixty participants (30 males, 30 females) took part in this experimental study. None of them had any prior involvement in research. All of the participants were from the University of Aberdeen. Participants were split into three groups of 20 (20 in the one person condition, 20 in the two person condition and 20 in the five person condition). This split was gender balanced, with 10 males and 10 females in each condition. Participants were randomly assigned to each condition.  Design, materials and Procedure  The experiment was a within-subject design. Participants were asked to remember four sets of four words. Once memorised, they had to arrange each set of words into alphabetical order. This was done in either an individual, pairs or groups of five condition (see Appendix, Table 1). Participants were timed in order to understand the speed of completion, and accuracy was also recorded. The experimenters recorded the times for the individual and group conditions, but the pairs condition had self-timers which participants held while they were performing the task. Shortly after the task was completed, participants had the opportunity to compare scores and referee each other's answers.  Results  The results of the experiment were analysed using one way ANOVA, to determine the effects of group size on the amount of time taken and accuracy of completion. Data from the analysis was displayed in the Appendix (Table 2). Results of the ANOVA show a significant main effect of speed, F (2,57) = 3.745, p < .05, but there was no significant main effect of accuracy F (2,57) = 2.023, p > .05.  Discussion
