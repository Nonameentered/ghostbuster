The luxury debates have been closely entwined with the rise of modernity, and while 'luxury' has ceased to be a central issue, in the supposed 'post-modern' world, I would argue that the issues that were pertinent to the writers of the eighteenth and late-nineteenth century are still with us today; and our knowledge of this past debate can only serve to sharpen our acumen, and make us more aware of the role of 'conspicuous consumption' It is my intention to examine the implications of the eighteenth and late nineteenth century luxury debates by employing these categories as a means of injecting a bit of order (albeit artificial) into the vast amount of literature written on this subject. Despite the tendencies of our relativist age to avoid crouching the debate in the language of morality, it is important to note that morality remains very much an integral part of the luxury debates, despite the shift from the vice/virtue dichotomy to one of dependence/freedom. Whatever their stands on luxury, the writers who participated in the luxury debates were keenly aware that 'luxury' was not a self-contained concept, but was rather a useful tool in understanding and critiquing the wider notion of the nature and progress of society.
