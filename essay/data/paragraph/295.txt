The lives of professional sportsmen show how it is impossible to achieve all of the ideals that construct hegemonic masculinity, which therefore reveals how hegemonic masculinity operates in order to maintain its all encompassing dominance over the gender order. In his interview with Steve Donoghue (a champion in the iron man sporting practice) Connell asserts that Steve is an exemplar of hegemonic masculinity, as the life he leads makes him the embodiment of the masculine ideals of "competitiveness, toughness and physical capability" (Connell in Messner and Sabo, 1990; 94). However, Steve's testimony reveals that in order to maintain this status he has to sacrifice other masculine ideals that would jeopardise his physical performance, for example he can't "go wild" when he is socialising (92). Therefore, the representation of Steve and other sporting heroes like him can be understood as the This means that sporting heroes are the tangible symbols for some aspects of hegemonic masculinity, namely the primacy of physical prowess, the domination of women, and the marginalisation of ethnic minorities and homosexuals. However, the sportsmen are unable to fulfil other aspects of hegemonic masculinity because they are antagonistic with the ideals they symbolise. Consequently, the other masculine ideals that contribute to hegemonic masculinity have different, often directly oppositional, symbols: for every sporting hero there is a 'bad boy', hedonistic Hollywood actor. Therefore, the existence of symbolic sporting heroes reveals that the hegemonic masculinity of which they form an integral part reproduces itself through the construction of a multiplicity of symbols that are often contradictory, yet always culturally exalted; and this shows how sporting practices contribute to the societal perceptions of masculinity and the roles of men and women that permeate all of society.
