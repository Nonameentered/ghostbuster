The most commonly used instrument to measure authoritarianism is the F-scale (Adorno et al., 1950). This scale consist of a series of questions, measuring the respondent's level of authoritarianism. The questions mainly try to judge whether the respondent is conformist or anti-conformist. Specifically it looks at correlates of prejudice such as an exaggerated sense of superiority, a need for power and dominance over those considered weaker and unintelligent and a need to uphold traditional norms and values.
