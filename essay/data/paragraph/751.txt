A number of the effects of the Black Death were only short term and evened out after a few years. For example, inflation of agricultural produce after the Black Death subsided and prices regained their previous levels. Wages also fell in a few years back to more usual levels Although there were a number of technological advancements after the Black Death, many of the major breakthroughs of the time came before the plague such as windmills and complex field systems in agriculture and developments in wool and silk manufacture Gutenberg's printing press was an advancement that came as a result of the population shortage after the Black Death; however, printing did not really become popular until the 1470s when the population was increasing. Also, the most important centers of printing were Venice, Rome and the Southern German cities where there was the fastest demographic growth. This suggests that the Black Death did not have a great impact on the technological advancements of the time.
