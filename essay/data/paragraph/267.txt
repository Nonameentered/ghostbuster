Concluding, one can with validity argue that the violent tactics employed by the suffragettes in the Women's Social and Political Union were instrumental in pushing the female enfranchisement forward. Of course, the role of militancy in achieving the vote is highly controversial, yet the connection between their physical tactics and the Female Suffrage Bill of 1918 cannot be denied. The WSPU gave the government an image of what women - and voters - should not be: extremist, unreasonable and stubborn. The suffragettes used their bodies as symbols of warfare against anti-suffrage views on the female gender, and their physical tactics nonetheless managed to place the mainstream of the political process in an uncomfortable position of having to face the questions raised by their campaign. The image of women in British society was changed due to some of the violent tactics of the WSPU; with activism, militant action, and self-righteousness, the suffragette movement succeeded in looking into the contradictions of the political system of the 19 th century, and to push forward on a wave of strong moral introduction of female suffrage. The WSPU carried out wordly arguments, managing to collect enough sympathy and enough protest to render the cause inacceptable for the political institutions. It was the question of putting women's human condition, of their rights and equalities, on a table which would otherwise have remained untouched.
