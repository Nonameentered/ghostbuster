The Black Death had a dramatic effect on the population of Florence. It is estimated that the city's population fell from around 140,000 in 1338 to around 60,000 in 1378 and 'did not recover the pre-plague level until the late fifteenth century' Emergency measures were taken in the late 1340s by the Signoria, which included free distributions of food for the poor, increased wages and controls on the price of food. The economic effects of the plague included the decline in the price of labour and a rise in the price of land. These factors helped to reduce the economic inequalities between the classes and the sharp rise in the number of sane transactions of property and money meant that more people had capital. Patricia Fortini Brown believes that 'it was this enlargement of the class of property holders to include many who had previously had no opportunity for owning land or trade, that constituted the most far-reaching impact of the Black Death in Florence' The influence of the middle class was augmented and they 'were more equipped to take up high office in the state than they had been before the plague' Yale Professor Paul Zimmerman sums up Florence's place in the Italian Renaissance: 'Rome was the ideal of antiquity; Florence was the reality of the Renaissance' For many reasons, Florence was pre-eminent in Renaissance Italy. The city was wealthy, well-populated and in a position for trade and it was also politically freer then elsewhere. The Florentine ruling class was more willing to patronize art then most other Italian cities. Florence was home to renowned artists and other intellectuals such as Dante, Brunelleschi, Donatello, Marsilio Ficino and Colucc
