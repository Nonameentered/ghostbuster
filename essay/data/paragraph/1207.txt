The psychological effects of dementia on the patient have a profound impact on the caregiver. The caregiver should only be considered a 'carer' when not only are they providing care for the patient but also when it results in an emotional strain (Bristot, 1986). This is clearly manifest in the number of psychological effects endured by the caregiver, due to the changes exhibited in the patient.
