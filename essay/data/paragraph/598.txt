To answer a question on Russia, I think it is first necessary to give some general details about this extraordinary and difficult to classify country. Russia stands eight thousand miles long, for much of the year it is landlocked, surrounded by foreign powers with whom it shares seas and rivers with. Russia has specific producer regions upon which some areas are dependent; Russia's variable climate makes growing hard in many areas. Russia's population in 1905 was very large and very mixed, only about fifty percent of this population was infact Russian. Nationalities including Ukrainians, Polish and Armenians made this a multi-cultural, multi-religious country which was very hard to generalise about demographically. In terms of classes, Russia had some more traditional groups such as peasants, landowners, autocracy and merchants. Whilst also having some modernising classes such as industrialists, foreigners and intelligentsia. Politically, Russia was run by a single autocratic monarch, seen as ordained by God. Democracy was seen as an evil the Russian people ought to be saved from, political parties as well as free speech were not allowed under the Tsar.
