The multiple virulence elements discussed above are only fully expressed when replicating within macrophages. This phases represents the intracellular survival segment of the organism's life cycle and well as enabling replication also enables the evasion of nosocomial treatments. During this process the released bacteria travel from one macrophage to another via vesicles shrank from the phagosome membrane.
