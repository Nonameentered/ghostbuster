Steven Katz claims in his essay on the historical perspective of the Holocaust that 'the intentional murder of European Jewry during World War II, is historically and phenomenologically unique' Annihilations have occurred in many countries throughout the century including Turkey, Rwanda, China, Bosnia and Cambodia, and whilst there are significant differences between each one- such as method of slaughter, death toll and time span of persecution- there are some factors common to them all. In fact, the Holocaust was not even the first great massacre of the twentieth century as the Armenian genocide occurred during the First World War, and Melson argues that it is 'a more accurate archetype than is the Holocaust for current mass murder in the postcolonial third world and in the contemporary post-communist world' However this does not exclude the Holocaust from sharing common characteristics with other massacres (as Katz disputes) for, on a fundamental level, patterns can be drawn between them. For instance they all arise from revolutionary or wartime climates, and also the motivation for their persecution was due to threat felt by the perpetrating parties. Therefore the Holocaust is not entirely unique, and neither are the other massacres of the twentieth century despite their geographical and statistical differences.
