Therefore, 'The Picture of Dorian Gray' is influenced fundamentally by Lombroso. Wilde uses the concept of physicality in his descriptions, and also forms Gray's personality according to many of the characteristics of the born criminal. However, he also draws upon contemporary developing theories of environmentally induced degeneration to seal the fate of the protagonist. Overall, abiding only by the principles of Lombrosian theory it would be difficult to create a character with both any sense of remorse and any empathy within the reader, and both of these are necessary to maintain interest in and affinity with the novel. It would also prevent any final sense of demise, climax or conclusion to the novel. Wilde, subsequently, uses Lombroso's beliefs about criminality and degeneration as a basic literary vehicle from which to develop his novel- after all, his aim was not to create a scientific document but an enthralling tale of the deterioration of a man as a result of his whimsical desire for eternal youthfulness.
