One of the most widely used forms of discourse analysis is semi-structured interviews, which are also often known as conversational interviews. These interviews enable the researcher to explore issues at greater depths than is typical in structured interviews, and therefore aim to explore what has been referred to in the discourse analytic studies as 'discursive context' (Schegloff et al., 1977). By using these semi-structured interviews the researcher is able to gain an understanding of the events, feelings and experiences of those being interviewed. Through hearing the words of those involved the researcher is able to gain a better understanding of the thought process behind the words. These semi-structured interview can also be used in counselling sessions, thereby allowing the researcher to gain an insight into both the patient's verbal and non-verbal language, which in turn can provide an idea of the meaning those words may have for the patient.
