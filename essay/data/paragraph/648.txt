Habermas's work echoes the emancipatory theme within Marxist thought; in both there exists the respective victims who need to be freed. Throughout both their theories there is the idea of repression (though in different forms) of society, which must be lifted (though by different means) in order for society to operate in equality. In both theories the definite need to change society is an inherent part of the diagnosis made for improvement. Habermas's focus on the relation of economic workings to the population, and the way this economic system is legitimated, mirrors the area of sociology which Marx chose to study. In addition, two of Marx's main concepts are maintained in Habermas; that of class conflict, although the classes Habermas defines are very different to those Marx identified; and that of ideology, although Marx's idea of the ruling class using classical economics to oppress a working class is drastically altered under Habermas.
