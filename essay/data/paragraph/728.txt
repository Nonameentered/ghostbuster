Climate and environment are two very prevalent claims for East Asia's divergence from the West, which Landes also notes. He claims that: 'where Europeans were able to work small family farms, their Asian counterparts were limited to large productive units, the economy of intensive (and exploitative) labor' The environment was a hindrance, for unlike Europe, the East does not experience seasonal rainfall; in many parts of Asia it rains for long periods and then not at all, for 'Indochina and parts of China, Japan and India all receive a majority of their annual precipitation in the form of holiday rain' This lack of consistency contributed to a lack of agriculture, with a third of East Asia's terrain consisting of desert and steppe land, and it 'confronted its inhabitants with a major problem' Landes' conclusion was that 'no societies build rich cultures in deserts or on steppes'
