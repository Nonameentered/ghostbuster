The problem with the power residing in Hitler's 'charismatic rule' however, was that it required constant reinforcement from the regime. 'Hitler himself kept tight control over what soon became a cult of personality, carefully exploiting the image of him so to sustain the loyalty of the German people." Hence, in a regime as absolute as that in Nazi Germany, it is perhaps logical to observe that there was no one institution to which the power was vested, as would have been with a liberal democracy. Rather, the power stemmed from Hitler himself. Legitimacy was practically non-existent in terms of intangible elements such as the emergence of a strong state, and the possibilities of elections- all no through Hitler's 'charismatic rule', the cement that held the regime together was not supra-personal' The underlying imperatives of the regime were driven by a 'propensity towards destruction'; all in the seeming larger interests of the German people, which required more and more men to fight and die for Hitler's cause. This in effect, served to jeopardise the constitutional foundations of the Third Reich.
