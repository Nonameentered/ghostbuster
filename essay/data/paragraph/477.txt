The purpose of this experiment is to explore the relationship between the forms of Newton's 2nd Law appropriate to linear motion and to rotational motion, explore the physical behaviour of 2nd moment of mass and to develop understanding of the nature of experimental error and the analysis of experiment data. The moment of inertia of the three discs is to be determined by experiments and compared with one obtained from a theoretical relationship.
