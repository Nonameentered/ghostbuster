Overall, in explaining East Asia's dwindling economic progress E.L. Jones' claim that 'the technological category of explanation is probably a diversion' Europe's success lay in its interest in Eastern inventions and their subsequent desire to improve upon them. East Asia's attitude, on the other hand, seemed to be the antithesis of Europe, for they had little interest in what the West had to offer unless it became a vital acquisition (such as the cannon). Creativity was not encouraged within the East, for in China even the most prosperous emperors such as K'ang Chi (1622-1722) and Ch'ien Lung (1736-1795), as Mokyr notes, 'discouraged the kind of dynamism that was throbbing throughout Europe at that time' As the next section of this essay will demonstrate, technology is an illustrative example of an Eastern ethos that restricted growth in many aspects of economy and society, an ethos which can be labelled as the most prominent cause for the slowing of East Asian economic progress.
