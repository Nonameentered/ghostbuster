The government of Florence was important in the development of the Italian Renaissance. Italy at this time was not unified and there was not central government controlling the whole country. Instead, many independent city-states competed with each other. Florence was ruled by an oligarchic system which was in theory a republic however in reality it was controlled by a wealthy elite. This system was capable of change. 'When the people wanted something, the government was able to listen and, if it became necessary, to make changes' The state had the capacity to be innovative and reform and this allowed the development of Renaissance ideas. Marco Viviani pointed to this twin character of the ruling system; of tradition and reform. He suggests that it 'was an oligarchy, but an oligarchy which also respected public opinion' Historically, Florence had a reputation for justice and was even called la civile Jaxe. (the civil law) These reforms created an environment that encouraged risk taking, established the status of the private individual in public life and made the city prosperous and attractive enough for artists to work there.
