with This gives a cross-sectional area requirement of 3.7cm This cross-sectional area of wire will have to be split up into several stands to make sure that minimum tension and compression is being applied to the outside and inside of the wire, which would be significant if using solid core wire. If the wire is constantly being bent, i.e. tensioned and compressed too much, then the metal will harden and snap. This is another reason for using copper, as it's ductility will delay this happening. Another alternative to the arrangement of strands other than a circular cross-section would be a flat wire. This will reduce stress in the wire more still, prolonging the life of the wire for maintenance purposes.
