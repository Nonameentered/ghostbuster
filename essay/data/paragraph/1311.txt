Over a period of four hours, a mock Participative Rapid Appraisal (henceforth PRA) was performed by two groups of students each comprising about 15 individuals, one group posing as the representatives of a village community from Ethiopia and the other as NGO workers. This experience and information found in literature provide the basis for an examination of the effectiveness of PRA's. An analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the PRA technique concludes that its implementation offers an effective methodology but that its success is influenced enormously by the competence, experience, creativity and even good fortune of its organisers.
