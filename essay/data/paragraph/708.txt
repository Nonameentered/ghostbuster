The most prominent common features between the massacres of the twentieth century and the Holocaust, however, concern the motives and reasons behind why each massacure occurred. Rozensaft argues that one of the main connections between the Holocaust and other annihilations is 'the underlying motive, the urgent drive that animate the perpetrators' In the case of the Holocaust, this 'drive' was anti-Semitic hatred, and Ann Frank noted the Germans were 'involved in a mysterious and cosmic battle against infiltration from the East and Washington's attempt to keep Europe Jewish' Similarly, the Ottoman Empire's objective was to increase mobility and to create a 'pan-Turkic nation' and therefore Turanian identity had to be forged, and this involved the annihilation of minority groups such as the Armenians- 'more than half of the two million Armenians living in the Empire had been killed by 1918' More recently, in Bosnia the Serbian government was trying to create their idea of 'greater Serbia', a strongly nationalistic state, and 'the policy of ethnic cleansing was designed to create areas populated by single ethnic groupings' Consequently, the Bosnian Muslims were stigmatised, and targeted for massacres. The Cambodian genocide would appear to share a very different motive to all the afore mentioned annihilations, for, as Cullen comments 'many histories of the Khmer Rouge regime simply forget the victims of genocide' Yet, in fact, the severity of the massacre was to ensure their communist state, and also encouraged by the previous attacks endured by Cambodia at the hands of Vietnam. Grease concludes that Pol Pot's murder spree 'was at least partly directed at Vietnam and China in an attempt to prove that Cambodians were pure enough to survive without foreign assistance or protection' Thus, on a fundamental level, it can be seen that motivation for massacure is common across the twentieth century, whether it be for territorial or ideological reasons, and this would appear to be the force that binds all annihilations of this period
