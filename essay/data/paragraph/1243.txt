Studies into selective attention have been active for a number of decades now, and have not only provided us with valuable insights into other theories of ageing, such as generalised slowing, which can then be used to improve life in old age but have also provided a number of tools to measure and differentiate attentional processes which can also give us a better understanding of the complexity of cognitive ageing and its underlying causes.
