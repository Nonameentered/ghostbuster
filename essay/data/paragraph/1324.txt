The structure of education has been shaped by many cognitive psychologists over the past century, including John Dewey, Arnold Gesell and Lev Vygotsky (Stone, 1996). However, it is Jean Piaget who has significantly influenced the structure of education, as mainstream educators have found his theory on child development more substantive and convincing (Stone, 1996; Kohlberg and Mayer, 1972; DeVries, 2000). Piaget's developmental theory is still widely applied to methods of teaching (DeVries, 2000). The premise of his developmental theory that is of interest here is that children's ability to assimilate experiences and consolidate knowledge is directly correlated to their age. The four stages of development, the sensori-motor stage, pre-operational stage, concrete operational stage and the formal operational stage are said to all occur within specified age brackets. It is also a domain general theory. Domain generality proposes that knowledge, once gained, can be applied across many different contexts and situations (Slater, Hocking and Loose, 2003).
