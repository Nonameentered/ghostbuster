Although some of the criticisms of the ideal speech situation appear to be largely sound, Habermas does maintain the suggestion as a valid method of emancipation. As such it appears they largely hold true. Tugendhat argued that for ideal speech to provide an ultimate structure for society, with everyone having access to the same chances of emancipation and functioning on equal levels, is far from possible. This appears largely true as social situations differ in many ways from doctor / patient relationships.
