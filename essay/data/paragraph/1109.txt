The Nazi state bureaucracy was more reliant on fear than on Hitler's 'charismatic rule'. The officials were in fact loyal to their own ambitions rather than the Fuhrer, and 'many state officials were neo-traditionalists, all of whom regarded Hitler as an instrument for the restoration of Germany's 'greatness' The loyalty to the Fuhrer did not extend to his orders, and these officials were also prone to attempt to bring about initiatives of their own against the will of the Fuhrer. This chaotic system of rule was perpetuated by the distrust between the Party and State, whereas the Party was Hitler's to command, the State tended to value autonomy.
