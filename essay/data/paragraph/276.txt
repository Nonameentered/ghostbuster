It therefore follows from the evidence presented here that the construction of gender identities was related to Imperialism and racism through the emphasis that the Imperialist project (with its racist presuppositions) placed upon white British masculinity. The primacy of white men is conveyed strongly in the adventure stories of the late nineteenth century; 'white manhood' is portrayed as an example of civility and the epitome of the Victorian notions of propriety, whereas women and the oppressed cultures involved are depicted as inferior or dangerous. Imperialism, and the racism it is imbued with, therefore affected men and women's sense of identity by confirming that there was a natural order in British society and the Imperial world, in which white men formed the rightly dominant group.
