Initially I will look at what racism is; it can be defined as an ideology which categorises people as inferior according to their race (Beckett, 2005). It is expressed through actions, beliefs and behaviours and these actions and behaviours are based on the idea that one race is superior, and those of other races are inferior. Racism is reflected in structures and processes in society; for example the legal system, which affects housing, employment and education (Fenton, 1998). Racism works to exclude non-whites from certain areas of society, and by doing so reinforces the idea that non-whites are inferior (Beckett, 2005).
