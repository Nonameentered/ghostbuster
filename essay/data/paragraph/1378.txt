Alternatively, pressure connections can also be used. These types of connections are secure and desirable because there are fewer points where the current can escape, making it more efficient. The two main types of pressure connections are crimp and clamp, which can be expanded on in more detail below. Crimp connectors are the most commonly used pressure connection and is what many people will think of when they hear the word ‘crimp'. This involves the metal conductor being forced into a Z-shaped crimp which is fitted onto the live conductor and then fastened by a crimping tool. The Z-shaped crimp should 'grab' the metal conductor, making sure it cannot be pulled back out. They are, however, liable to corrosion and must be sealed or insulated after to ensure a good connection. Clamp connectors are used when connecting large multiplicities of conductors together. They consist of two half circles, one of which has a slight angular V-shaped cut into the end. This is then placed onto the live conductors and fastened together with either screws or crimping. The thing to note about clamp connectors is that they are secure against ‘pulling’ forces, but they have less insulation against electrical breakdown in the presence of other metals, so they must be sealed or specially insulated.
