The writing of Simmel on the discipline of sociology is characterised by a desire to reduce the study of society to its essence. Instead of viewing society as Durkheim did, that is, as a generic force working externally of the individual and reifying itself through organisational structures and artefacts, Simmel was rather concerned with giving a 'serious [...]analysis of the social bond' (Nisbit 1959: 479), which can be described as the reciprocally working relation between two or more social actors. He denounced the view that a society "as such" could exist outside individuals (Simmel 1971a: 27), preferring to build a sociological system from the individual's standpoint. In the first place, Simmel represented social interaction as the dynamic attempt to reconcile the opposite drives within each human being - 'for example, the individual and the group, the need for conformity and for individuation, the need for stability and for flexibility' (Abel 1959: 478). Despite the theoretical character of these opposites, Simmel believed all "forms-of-sociation" are to some extent conditioned by the tension between them. Secondly, Simmel sought to separate the The form thereby attains a certain "objective" quality, acting as a generally discernable trait in a variety of social circumstances. As an illustration of this position, Simmel considered the phenomenon of secrecy to be a social form which could, therefore, not be judged as such, as it 'stands in neutrality above the value functions of its content' (Simmel 1950: 331). Furthermore, the greater the number of links through sociation, the more the social sphere becomes "society".
