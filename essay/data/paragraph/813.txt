Pearson's product moment correlation was used to correlate scores for all three dependant variables (see table 1 in the appendix).  For the experimental group scores for EAT and BSQ showed a small negative correlation with . 344 and 8.9% shared variance. This suggests that there is a small relationship between body dissatisfaction and eating deviancy. Contrary to this, for the control group there was a non significant relationship between EAT and BSQ, with only 0.2% shared variance between the two. This suggests that levels of body dissatisfaction may contribute more to disordered eating patterns for the experimental group than for the control group.
