Pixar's 2004 film The film opens with a large black-and-white advert for the air force, where enthusiastic pilots are shown storing their B-52 bombers, with the task of protecting the US 'even in the darkest hour'. Images of Chuck Yeager breaking the sound barrier recur throughout, as the 'empire of the air' is extolled as the epitome of modern day society.  The only queer dynamics are the characters themselves, crippled by their loneliness. These 'lone warriors' are stuck in the role of jester-guardians, imaging a world they can never inhabit, where expensive toys, an airplane graveyard and silly songs recreate a fantasy world of hopes, dreams and nightmarish memories.  Unlike The film openly opposes the Bomb and implicitly rejects MAD, the prevalent US policy of the time, when it shows the enduring insignificance of the individual in the face of a larger agency. As night-vision shots of deserted air forces bases are projected onto the screen alongside the similarly empty homes of the protagonists, the message is subtle and yet clear. The bomb is the ultimate imbecilic expression of man's capacity to experiment upon himself, leaving only a desolate husk of humanity in its wake.        Robots of The film demands an end to the arms race and a new respect for the moral imperatives of peace. Although the film is 'overly moralistic, anachronistic and baldly didactic', it provides a fascinating insight into Eisenhower's Cold War era. American nuclear policy is likened to a game of chicken, where ultimately 'we invent a reason to go on', and in so doing fail to realise the sheer dominance of the Bomb over both the state and the individual.  Overall, protagonists of Atom bomb cinema are often portrayed as socially isolated trapped within a world of death, mental instability, violence and desolate militarism. Particularly in the post-war era, the Bomb was pushed as the ultimate symbol of war by Governments on both sides
