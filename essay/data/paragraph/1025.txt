In the design process, a number of analyses were carried out in order to achieve an optimal gearbox design for a commercial meat slicer. The manual calculations were carried out smoothly and a number of gear combinations were investigated. Appropriate components such as gears, shafts, bearings and housing were selected and examined under different conditions. The optimal output was determined through detailed analysis so that the bending and surface stress conditions were met. A spreadsheet was also created in order to summarize the possible arrangements. On the other hand, the shafts were designed based on the optimal gear parameters. where the bending moment diagrams and shear force diagrams were constructed in order to perform analysis on bending. Computer program would also be used in order to determine and compare results of shaft between computer outcome and calculating results. Finally, bearings for corresponding shafts would also be selected based on their rotating speed and maximum load.
