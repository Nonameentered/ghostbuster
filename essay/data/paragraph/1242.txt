These reduced selective attentional capacities also have a number of cognitive consequences, most of which can be aptly explained by the reduced-inhibition hypothesis. A number of studies have examined the role of selective attention in language comprehension and found the reduced inhibition to account for the age differences as older adults have difficulty in inhibiting distractors that are embedded in a text (Zacks & Hasher, 1994, 1997, as cited in McDowd & Shaw, 2000). However, Dywan & Murphy (1996) found that younger adults who had supposedly inhibited the distractors also remembered them capably, whereas the older adults who had used the distractors had trouble remembering them. As a result, Dywan & Murphy (1996) attributed the age-related differences to source-monitoring errors, stating that older adults are unable to discriminate between the source being the target or the distractor. In spite of this, reduced inhibition has also been considered to affect memory performance as memory for relevant information would be poor due to working memory containing irrelevant information (Hasher & Zacks, 1988). However, this explanation also has conflicting views as the majority of research is based on divided attention studies that suggest memory deficits to be due to a diminished attentional capacity. In addition, selective attention studies have also shown reduced inhibition to affect performance in complex problem solving tasks. Molander and B Regardless of the approach taken, these studies have shown us that diminished selective attention ability in older adults, as a consequence, also reduces language comprehension and memory and problem solving, thus showing selective attention to affect many aspects of the lives of older people.
