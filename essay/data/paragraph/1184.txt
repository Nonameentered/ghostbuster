The imitation of facial expressions has been found to be one of their innate capabilities (Meltzoff & Moore, 2002). However, for newborns, this is much more complex than merely a matter of copying. Newborns have never actually seen their own faces; consequently the only way for a neonate to know what their face looks like is by internally feeling their own body (a process called kinaesthesia). Therefore in order to imitate, newborns need to somehow understand the similarity between that internal feeling and the external face they are looking at (Gopnik et al., 1999). This understanding is thought to be innate with research showing that newborn's as young as a day old have imitated facial expressions (Meltzoff & Moore, 2002).
