It is imperative to examine the doctrines and practices (in particular, the deep belief in Purgatory, the sacrament of Penance, and its derivatives such as relics, pilgrimages and most notoriously, indulgences) of the Church, which generated oppositions from the laity and clergy. Interestingly, criticisms of Church practices and doctrines existed in the late fourteenth century, in the form of Lollardy (led by the Oxford theologian John Wycliffe) called for a clear divide between spiritual and temporal power; obedience to the church authorities as far as their behaviour merited; the Bible as the only source of religious authority; condemned the doctrine of transubstantiation; and attacked the veneration of saints (and relics) The humanists also shared the view that the Church had diverged away from the one true religion, embraced misconstrued beliefs and had become too intertwined with the secular world. Convinced that grace and forgiveness could only come from God alone, Luther also harshly condemned the sale of Indulgences in his ninety-five theses. However, the cynicism surrounding the practice of Indulgences were not unique to the eve of the Reformation, and was a pervasive element in literary traditions, as seen in Chaucer's Pardoner's Tale which was written in 1400. It is interesting to note however, that the supply of indulgences was in response to the demands of the laity, and was perhaps a manifestation of the paranoia of securing one's own salvation. What is perhaps significant is that the demanding penitential system and mechanical ritualized religion offered by the Church only provided temporary relief for the laity, and had led instead to the exacerbation of fear and anxiety as reflected in the obsession with the constant absolving of sins.
