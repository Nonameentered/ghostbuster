Apart from these more tangible measures members of other research teams can provide objective views of results and criticism of methods, termed inter-rater reliability, (Merrick, 1993). This could even be used to ensure research was worth undertaking in the first instance, checking of the appropriateness of the sample size and analysis procedure. In some studies, a self-evaluation measure can be employed such as a questionnaire where answers are related to valid, reliable criteria. This is useful for gaining an understanding of participant self-views, (Hayes, 1997).
