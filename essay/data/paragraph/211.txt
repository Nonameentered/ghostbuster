The emphasis that Rousseau lays on the collective, however, is today regarded with mistrust. After all, the functioning of the general will depends entirely upon the full dedication of the citizenry to the social contract, and we find 'no restriction of principle on what it may command in that form'. As soon as all sovereignty passes from the individual to the state, a greater power comes to exist which '[man] cannot use without the help of others'. In a wider interpretation of the social contract as merely a thought experiment, this socialisation obtains a somewhat enforced character.
