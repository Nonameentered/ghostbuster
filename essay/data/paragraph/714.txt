Lombroso believed that degenerates, more specifically criminals, possessed 'numerous anomalies in the face, skeleton and various psychic and sensitive functions' These physical characteristics made them identifiable as prone to criminality and, on a more general level, subordinate to the aesthetically 'normal' members of society. Moreover, such characteristics could be inherited and therefore people could be born as criminals. In 'The Portrait of Dorian Gray', Wilde uses Lombroso's concept of degeneration and physicality to establish both character description and the demise of Dorian Gray through his painting.
