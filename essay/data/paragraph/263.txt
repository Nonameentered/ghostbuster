The battle escalated further when the House of Commons passed the Cat and Mouse Act in 1913. According to this act, women released from prison due to physical ill health, could be re-arrested once they had recovered, and the hunger strikes of suffragettes led to waves of releases and arrests. This infuriated the suffragettes, who relied more and more on symbols for self-assertion (Vicinus 1985). Mass public rallies were organised with banners and patriotic music, with frequent outbursts of angry speeches (Harrison 1978). Because of the extreme attention that the suffragettes drew, the parliament was literally urged to change (Harrison 1978). A statement of 1913 of The Times put it as follows: 'there is no means of escape, the Government cannot dispose of the suffrage leaders, they are the prisoners of the public' (Lawrence 2001). And this is precisely what powerful tactics of the suffragettes enabled them to achieve. By their vehement and defiant arguments, and refusal to rest until their demands were met, they gained a moral victory more powerful than that which the conventional constitutionalists were able to gain in over forty years of campaigning. Even when subjected to ridicule, the suffragettes were successful in providing a persuasive counterargument (York 2000). The resonance between the boundless violence inflicted upon the women's bodies and the morally inferior political methods employed by the anti-suffragist can not be ignored.
