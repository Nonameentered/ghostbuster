Around 1.45 pm I entered the shop, and at that moment there were about three customers around, apart from the two shopkeepers. The shop, called Besides old and new books, the shop also sells postcards and old placard photos. The counter is situated downstairs, in the middle of the shop. A small staircase leads to a first floor, where a small room with academic literature and a big room with novels and poetry can be found. I decided to stay upstairs for a while. In the big room, there were two customers, besides me and a friend that I had brought along. The upstairs area creates a lesser degree of constraint, as there is no shopkeeper around and the street can not be seen. This might create a more closed-off environment. Still, the customers whispered, as would have been the case in a library.
