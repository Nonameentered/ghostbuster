Whereas social changes and higher living standards were previously seen as the result of industrialisation and the great increase of supply of a wide range of goods, the driving forces on the 'demand side' are now becoming increasingly appreciated and researched (McCracken 1990). One of the reasons for this enormous increase in consumption may be found in the fact that new markets were sought to create a demand for this surplus of goods (Rappaport 1996:81). However, this does not tell the entire story. The general enthusiasm with which new material achievements were hailed had a profound effect on society and the way in which the middle class defined itself as part of it. Also men, and more particularly women within the middle class were both changed and changed their identities consciously with increasing consumerism. As 'shopping' was essentially gendered as a female activity in the second half of the nineteenth century, changes of gender perception were most acutely visible with women. Women were now encouraged to beautify themselves and surround their middle class homes with a paraphernalia of gentility.
