The pantograph will have a wire traversing down the side of middle of one of it's supporting members. The power could have been sent through the frame itself, however this creates problems with insulating the up/down mechanism on the pantograph and the tram body. Here I have looked at whether to use AC or DC through the pantograph and advantages and disadvantages for each. I have also looked at the conductor used in the pantograph and how that's going to be insulated. In looking at the conductor I have seen how the resistivity of the wire affects the cross-sectional area of wire required and it's shape. Lastly, I have looked at how to join the wiring on the pantograph to limit corrosion and benefit maintenance.
