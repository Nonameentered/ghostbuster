Even if the marriage and fertility rates, potentially unrepresentative and framed as they may be, are accepted as plausible, questions have been raised about the placement of emphasis in Wrigley and Schofield's interpretation. David Weir argued that marital behaviour altered considerably over time causing a shift in the dominant factor affecting fertility and thus population trends. Some have noted that it is difficult to assert the dominance of fertility on population trends, particularly when within the boundaries of the Malthusian model. 'Imposing' this framework on the fertility data has required Wrigley and Schofield to argue that a 'long lag' relationship of about fifty years existed between a change in real wages and its affects on fertility. J.A. Goldstone accepts that a lag is a plausible explanation; however suggests that reducing it to a twenty year difference would be more accurate. Perhaps in cases where inheritance would depend on parental approval influence would be quite significant, but for the majority of the population inheritance would not have been left. Although I do not wish to argue in a deterministic fashion that mortality was the most important factor in shaping the population 'replacing one bald stereotype with another', it is important to look at the quite significant part played by mortality in order to question Wrigley and Schofield's interpretations.
