Disease had specific characteristics; it was often recorded in parish registers as a cause of death and appeared in other primary evidence such as wills. Famine did not have such a 'discernable pattern to help the historian identify it' it did not have such specific characteristics, it was rarely recorded in parish registers, and those who could write (more likely the upper sorts) would have been less likely to feel the effects of famine and able to relocate in plenty of time before actual starvation set in. Several neighbouring villages would also have increased deaths, a correlation between prices and mortality should be noticeable, usually some reference to dearth would exist in one form of source or another and there should be fewer conceptions than usual. Appleby discovered that famine had played a significant part in shaping the population in Cumberland and Westmorland; at certain times it was the dominant factor causing the death toll to mount, at other times it made areas more susceptible to disease (through lessened immune systems, and through desperate importing of foods from areas with epidemics) and made women less willing and less able to conceive.
