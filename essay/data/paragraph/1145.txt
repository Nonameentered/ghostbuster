The authoritarian personality has shown a trend in personality patterns formed in childhood. Research has found that those who score highly on authoritarianism tend to describe their childhood as being dominated by stern harsh fathers who insisted on absolute obedience. This theory is predominately a psychodynamic one as it is based on the idea of 'reaction formation', as a forbidden impulse is re-channelled into a safer course. In effect these minority groups are used as scapegoats as they are considered to be weak and powerless. In this case, the child is unable to express their anger towards their father and thus resulting in them redirecting their anger towards much safer targets such as minority groups (Gleitman, Fridlund & Reisberg, 1998). Defence mechanisms are used to hide their true feelings, for example they will repress their aggressive or sexual feelings and project those traits onto others. There is also a tendency to view the outside world as being populated with dangerous enemies who have to be attacked before they themselves are attacked. This personality consists of a lot of distrust for others. This negative view of people leads to the conclusion that harsh laws and order is necessary in order to control people.
