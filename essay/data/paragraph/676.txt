In conclusion, shame, guilt and embarrassment are not words for the same emotion, but contrasting feelings of self-consciousness, which arise from different situations and events. Shame and guilt emotions were considered similar, arising from personal failure or failing what is expected of a close relationship. Embarrassment arose from uncomfortable, unfamiliar public situations, which could not be controlled. Embarrassment tended to be a more trivial and transient emotion, but it also reflected a lapse in what is expected in social environments. These findings tell us something of the nature of social interaction; self-conscious emotions are brought about from a failure to comply with what is socially expected of a person, either in personal relationships or social situations. It would appear that these emotions are closely linked to the idea of conformity; people judge themselves based on what they assume others would think yet tend to be their own worst critic.
