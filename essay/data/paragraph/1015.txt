Motorcycles engines at present can have single-cylinder, two-cylinder, four-cylinder or six-cylinder and their displacements ranges from 250 cc to over 1500 cc. Most motorcycles nowadays often have two or four-cylinder engines. Engines with high displacement have higher fuel consumption and therefore generate more power. A multiple cylinder engine can have its cylinders arranged in horizontal, inline or V configurations. As mentioned beforehand, the main problems with V configuration engines were its vibrations and high centre of mass. Among the three configurations, the horizontal configuration has the best weight distribution (lower centre of gravity) and also produced the least vibrations. The following is an example of a racing motorcycle:
