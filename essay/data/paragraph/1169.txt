The amount of body fat carried is regulated by homeostasis, which ensures that the internal state is kept within a critical range to avoid disruption and death of cells (F.Schlaghecken, lecture, 5th March, 2004). Weight regulation is controlled by a negative feedback loop, which produces behaviour oscillating around the ideal 'set point'. We therefore eat to obtain nutrients when we are hungry, and stop when we are satiated. However, we often eat before we feel hungry and stop before we feel full. Thus, there must be other factors that influence our decisions to begin and end consumption. In the short-term, it seems that there is no single signal that is used exclusively (Rosenzweig, Breedlove & Leiman, 2002) though plasma glucose concentration, body temperature, plasma amino acids, cholecystokinin (CCK) and other hormones can all control meal patterns by feelings hunger and satiety (Friedman & Halaas, 1998).
