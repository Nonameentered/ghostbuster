Although customers where whispering, there was almost no audible interaction among them. A male customer of maybe late fifties looked for books around generally, while a younger couple was looking for books on pathology (or something alike). A woman of approximately the same age as me was furiously flipping through books on the other side of the room. No direct interaction existed between customers.   Eventually, after I stayed there for about 45 minutes, I went downstairs. Here I observed the same picture. Most customers came straight to the counter, and paid almost immediately after they ordered their books or postcards. I had noticed that the same woman was downstairs as well, and had bought something. On the counter I also noticed a woman of maybe 70 years of age, and two more customers, one of which was a baby of about one year old. At this point in my observation, there were at least 8 clients in the shop, although there were no perceptible interactions.   The relative silence created a strange picture, which made me draw the conclusion that people do not really want to interact, even if it is allowed. Talking on the counter seemed, even more than upstairs, not done. This led to the conclusion that the relative silence might be caused by the presence of the other people. Stronger evidence for this could not be found, however, as I left the shop at around 4.15 pm, when there were 6 customers and two staff members on the premises.  Even if the customers I observed were adults, they seemed to act like kids in a library, afraid to wake up the librarian! It came to mind that the atmosphere in the book shop might have been slightly better if there had been more customers, or less staff. As it was, people were not really interact not much, in fear of talking being considered 'noisy'.
