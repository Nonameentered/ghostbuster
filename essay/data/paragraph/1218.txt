False memories can also be readily induced in adults. In particular, hypnosis has the power to also create entire memories (Loftus, 1997), and therefore its ability to merely alter a memory is hardly surprising. In the case of Larry Mayes, hypnosis led an eyewitness to completely misidentify Mayes as her rapist. After spending 21 years in prison, he was later exonerated on DNA evidence. On Oct. 5, 1980, a cashier was raped by two men. At the time she was could not identify either of the men, other than to say one was taller than the other. The cashier was hypnotised by a detective and shown a photo line-up, where she picked out Mayes, despite failing to identify him in a prior physical line-up.
