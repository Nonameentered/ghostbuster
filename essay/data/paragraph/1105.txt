It should be obvious from the above that "luxury was not so much a key term in a debate as it was the marker for certain anxiety-'a convenient code for all of society's perceived problems.'" The luxury debates reinforced notions of 'Female luxury' and the close associations of women with consumption, without a deeper understanding of how men have helped shaped the ways in which women consume. It also served to highlight the modern tendency to use goods as the "primary vehicle for the construction of the self that has the opinion of others as an indelible part of its contents." The changing definitions of luxury and its subsequent link with taste also illustrate the changing expressions of sociability, which reflected the change in the pecuniary structure of society. Despite this and the argument that luxury facilitates social progress, there is a realization that while the luxury debates are becoming more inclusive, the gap between the haves and the have-nots has not narrowed, but have instead widened during Veblen's and Sombart's time. This has obvious bearing on the well being of a nation, and the social distribution of income is still very much on the present agenda. Lastly, despite the modern preference for economic arguments, the link between morality and luxury has been paradoxically strengthened, and remains as a bastion from which the critics of luxury draw their ammunition. The luxury debates therefore became an avenue where the problems of society were raised, and correspondingly, where the shape of an ideal modern society could be discussed.
