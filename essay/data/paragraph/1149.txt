The authoritarian personality is supported by the fact that the studies focus on the important relationship between social and political attitudes (Brown, 1965). Minority prejudice does tend to go with authoritarianism and people with this type of personality do also tend to hold certain political views such as, they are more obedient to authority and tend to accept the attitudes of those in power (Elm & Milgram, 1996). However prejudice has varied historically, therefore authoritarianism may just be a result of societal times and not ones family, as suggested by the psychodynamic approach. This calls into question the causality between authoritarianism and prejudice.
