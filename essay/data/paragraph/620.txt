Wrigley and Schofield's reconstructions of the demography of England and Wales during the early modern period attempted to examine the links between transitions in marriage and fertility and the effects of living standards such as real wages on nuptiality. In addition they sought to evaluate the impact of mortality as a preventative check on population growth. From 1541 to 1750 England's population increased from about three and a half million to approximately six million people. In addition to these census-style figures, Wrigley and Schofield also examined the average age at first marriage. From a low of twenty three for males and twenty one for females in 1550, age at marriage began to rise in the 1560s reaching highs of twenty seven for males and twenty five for females by 1750. However between 1550 and 1650 there were significant fluctuations in these figures, with some periods of high fertility and some of very slow population growth. (e.g mid century)
