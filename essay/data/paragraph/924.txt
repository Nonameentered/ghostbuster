Over recent years research into the link between emotional processes and alcohol consumption has burgeoned, and as a result we now have a greater understanding of the complex processes driving alcohol consumption in society. One such example of the sorts of emotional processes that have been studied in depth in this context is that of stress and coping. It has been noted by a number of researchers that, in certain individuals, problem-focused coping styles become less useful and even dysfunctional when faced with stress that is deemed 'unmanageable', and may even be replaced by 'escapist' or 'avoidant' coping responses (Theorell & Melen, 1982). Golding (1993), for example, found that preoccupation coping, one of the sub-scales of the Ways of Coping Questionnaire (Folkman & Lazarus, 1985), was the only coping style found to significantly anticipate alcohol consumption in her sample of individuals. Furthermore, Christensen, Sher & Huston (1987) established a positive relationship between high levels of escapist coping and the likelihood of engaging in problem drinking. Theoretically this supports the notion that alcohol is used as a means of avoiding complex emotions that cannot be managed in a useful way with problem-focused coping strategies (Rabow, 1999).
