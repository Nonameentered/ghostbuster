From these results it can be concluded how the donor transferred the genes from the Hfr strain to the recipient. When two bacteria of different genotypes mate genetic material is exchanged. In this experiment, the Hfr strain was the donor and passed a wild type allele at a certain locus to the recipient. To map the loci of the gene, they were plated on selective media at different time intervals to see when the recipient was able to grow. If the recipient has received the wild type allele it will be able to metabolize/utilize the compound in the media and thus grow. If the recipient had not accepted the wild type allele yet, it will not grow on the selective media. Looking at the plates and the growth that occurs it can be used to deduce when each gene had entered the recipient strain.
