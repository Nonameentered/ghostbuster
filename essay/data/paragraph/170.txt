In his work on The Metropolis and Mental Life (1900/1971), Simmel attempted to delineate the effect of modern life on an individual. Hereafter, he argued for the presence of 'a new individualistic spirit' (Vidler 1991: 34), caused by the diminished need for interaction between people in the city. The individual is, as noted before, the starting level for any social formation. It is the will of two or more individuals that define what relation takes place and, as said, 'the form and the content of these relations are not the same thing: the content makes it, while the form expresses it' (Simmel 1971a: 28). Hence, Simmel argued that the complex modern life encourages a seclusion of individuals, which in turn results in an increase of the "thing" society. 'By dint of lacking mutual relations and intercourse with one another [-] individuals grow out of the accustomed courses of feeling and action' (Simmel 1971a: 20), he wrote, while maintaining that '[t]he sole purpose of these forms is to give the whole an objective appearance, which is not disfigurable by its varying contents' (Simmel 1971a: 26).
