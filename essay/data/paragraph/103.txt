The problem with this book thus lies with its scientific inconsistency. It sets out with no clearly stated objective, while the use of scholarly caution and polite integrity is broken soon after the authors bring it up. While the authors promise in the introduction to 'employ the more neutral term 22), synonyms such as 'smart' (p. 127), 'very smart... Very dumb...' (p. 133) that occasionally crop up nearly indicate the carelessness with which the authors draw their conclusions. Frisby claims that 'to parade facts about racial differences before the general public is akin to putting a lit match to gasoline' (Frisby 1995). The authors of In the words of Sternberg: 'If you were to ask, "What inference do Herrnstein and Murray invite their readers to draw?" they go beyond what they know' (Miele 1995).
