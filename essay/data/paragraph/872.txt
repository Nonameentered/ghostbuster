There are many difficulties in studying the jury deliberation process, predominantly because it is illegal to view the process, or even to ask jurors about their experiences after a case. As a result of this the majority of the evidence is conducted under contrived circumstances under which the juries face no consequences for their decisions, or pressure as they would in a real jury. It may be because of this that research on mock juries has not been able to produce a unified theory of the jury deliberation process. It may however be that there cannot be a single unified theory of jury deliberation as there are so many situational factors which could be acting upon the process. The fact that shadow jurors fail to consistently reach the same verdict illustrates this (MacCoun and Kerr, 1988). It has been suggested that personality traits such as authoritarianism contribute to how juries deliberate, although there has not been much support for these ideas, (Parks and Kerr, 1999). It is important however not to see the story board model and social decision schemes as being mutually exclusive to each other because they are not. Both contribute to our understanding of how juries deliberate although, as discussed, neither provide a comprehensive theory. It is important to keep researching the area however to improve our legal system and to try to reduce such variability in proceedings.
