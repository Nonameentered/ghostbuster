Four active strain gauges are used in order to obtain maximum possible bridge output voltages, to provide temperature compensation, and to make the sensor/transducer insensitive to forces and moments other than the one being measured. These are mounted on two perpendicular 45 helices that are diametrically opposite to one another. Gauges 1 and 3, are mounted on the right hand helix, and sense a positive strain (tension), and gauges 2 and 4, mounted on the left-hand helix, sense a negative strain (compression). The two 45 helices define the principal stress and strain directions for a circular shaft subject to pure torsion. This set-up described can be seen in the following diagram
