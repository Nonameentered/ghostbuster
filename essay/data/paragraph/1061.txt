The philosophes were also associated with the 'science of the government,' and thus worked towards the creation of a 'science of making laws' (J.J. Rousseau). This provided the revolutionaries with knowledge about the current government, as well as learned ideas on how to replace it with a more equitable one. Furthermore, the disciples of the Enlightenment (especially Voltaire and Diderot) He brought to light the unnatural and unjustified privileges of the clergy and of the Second Estate, and worked towards the reducing of the oppressive and dictatorial powers wielded by the state. All these helped to cement a sense of rationalism amongst the French people. Nevertheless, the ideas of the enlightenment have also been criticised, in the sense that their theories were too simple to cope with the complexities of real life, and the 'revolutionary ideal' as they espoused did not provide an effective platform for socio-political change (for example, the difficulty in deciding on 'virtuous' leadership). The Enlightenment has thus been described as an 'era of criticism rather than a moment of philosophical views of the world."
