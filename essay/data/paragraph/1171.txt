In the hypothalamus, leptin binds to specific receptors in the arcuate nucleus, which causes a series of events to occur. By binding with the nucleus' receptors, leptin inhibits the production and secretion of agouti-related peptide (AGRP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). The arcuate nucleus is then stimulated to send excitatory signals to the paraventricular nucleus, causing the NPY to increase the appetite, decrease metabolism and stimulate the formation of adipose tissue. The binding of leptin also induces the release of melanocyte stimluating hormone (-MSH) that inhibits eating. As the leptin levels decrease, hunger is induced and weight may be gained (Rosenzweig, et al., 2002). However, once stimulated, the paraventricular nuclei also release corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) to the posterior pituitary. The release of CRH induces a release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), which in turn increases the metabolic rate, and the speed of the breakdown of fat stores. ACTH stimulated the adrenal cortex to release glucocorticoids and stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. This results in suppressing hunger and an increased metabolic rate (Friedman & Halaas, 1998; Rosenzweig, et al., 2002; Schwartz & Gelling, 2002).
