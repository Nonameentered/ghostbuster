At the top of the hierarchical ladder of the Church sat the pope. "...in the first part of the sixteenth century the papacy was undergoing a moral and spiritual crisis, its authority constantly being challenged by local governmental bodies and a growing number of intellectual dissenters" A condemnation of the Papacy for its perceived failure was included in the hierarchy of reformation. The two main points of attack on the Papacy were its leadership and it wealth. Towards this end, there were criticisms about "the pope's endless wars, the adoption of nepotism, the bondage to wealth and diplomats, avid secularism" and even it "unworthiness, because of moral as well as intellectual incompetence in the arts of government." Reformist ideas, such as that of conciliarists, who "sought to...restore a genuine sense of spiritual interdependence and freedom to the entire Church" But as Swanson adroitly brings out "this fundamentally hierarchical viewpoint was often interpreted in a select, partisan manner. Unsurprisingly, traditionalists (who advocated the hierarchical superiority of the pope), monarchists (in favour of the political power of the kings) and humanists (whose worship of classical antiquity had been the hallmark of Renaissance humanism) all had and shared different views about the nature and origin of secular and spiritual power and its proper relationship" Thus, though the issues of papal leadership and corruption constituted criticisms, the suggestions for reform in and of itself brought with it certain aspects of the old system as well. Moreover, although the papal sovereignty was under threat, it was nevertheless able to check the ambitions and roles of rulers and to force them to meet its demands, in order for their own ambitions to be met.
