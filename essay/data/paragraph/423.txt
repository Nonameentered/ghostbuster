Another piece of evidence used to support the endosymbiotic theory is the selective antibiotic sensitivity of the endosymbiotically derived organelles Unlike eukaryotic cells, mitochondria and chloroplasts are seen to be resistant to the majority antibiotics due to the lack of sterols in their cytoplasmic membrane and the antibiotics sensitivity in protein synthesis Another study also showed, through the addition and withdrawal of various different antibiotics, that mitochondria undergo binary fission in response to toxins from the same antibiotics, which were used to which was used to kill off the host eukaryotic cells Therefore, the mitochondria are selectively sensitive to certain antibiotics that were also known to affect prokaryotic cells, whereas the cytoplasm of the eukaryotic cell is relatively insensitive to these same antibiotics Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain respiratory enzymes When comparing mitochondria to prokaryotic cells, some of the enzyme systems which are present in prokaryotic cells, such as NADH dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidases are also found in mitochondria. Furthermore, these enzyme systems are not present in the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm, suggesting that they were indeed derived from a prokaryotic bacterium which was more complex than it was previously thought This also applies for Chloroplasts. Chloroplasts share similar metabolic pathways as found in cyanobacteria, such as the Calvin-Benson cycle, which is responsible for the fixation of carbon dioxide to form sugars in photosynthesis, and various electron transport pathways
