The advent of the Solidarity strikes and protests halfway 1980 struck a serious blow at the Polish communist regime. Whilst it provided a powerful response of workers to the repressive character and 'determination [of the Polish regime] to maintain [the political and economic] systems, whatever their human costs and lack of legitimacy', Where from came this powerful articulation of demands, and of 'the most powerful, sophisticated and advanced working-class movement yet seen, certainly in the 'communist' sphere and perhaps anywhere in the world'? Economic and political developments throughout the 1970s united with a blend of national-historical and wider Eastern European economic grievances to prepare the ferment for 'a new generation of protesting workers with a clearly different way of articulating their grievances [as] a strictly Polish phenomenon'.
