The case of Kelly Michaels aptly demonstrates how highly suggestible children can be. In 1983, a nursery employee was charged with 23 counts of sexual assault against 20 children under her care, based on a child's comment of how she had used an anal thermometer on him. Michaels was later convicted on 115 counts and given a 47-year sentence. However, in 1992, it was judged that "the questioning of the children was so suggestive and coercive that they were rendered incompetent to testify" (State Vs Michaels, 1994, p. 493) and Michaels was released, thus suggesting the children's reports of abuse were false.
