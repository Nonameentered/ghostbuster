People with Parkinson's disease inexplicably lose more than 80% of the dopamine producing cells in the substantia nigra ( Without dopamine the substantia nigra striatum cannot send out certain messages as they are unable to travel across the nerve connection, and it is this that leads to Parkinson's. The disease is described as a severe disorder of movement that involves tremors of the fingers, slowness of movement and problems with maintaining posture. There can also be a loss of facial muscle tone and general difficulty in all motor efforts. There are many symptoms for Parkinson's disease but they vary substantially from person to person, making diagnosis quite difficult.
