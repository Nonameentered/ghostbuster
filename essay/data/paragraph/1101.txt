In the eighteenth and late nineteenth century luxury debates, central to the issue of luxury was the notion of the'Self'. Women in particular were judged on their ability to project and maintain a public image of refinement and civility, which necessitated the expenditure of considerable pecuniary and personal resources. Furthermore, women had to guard against public censure of 'excess', and adopt "somewhat ostentatious moderation." This 'self-policing' was an attempt to uphold the ideal of gentility, which "assessed unostentatious and correct behavior as more proper than extravagance and fashion". For men, the 'Self' was judged in much the same way with regard to the "extravagance in dress, entertainment and housing, to large retinues and attendants, and generally in the display of wealth" as Priestley noted. Domenico argues that greater significance should be granted to the private realm and the way in which men used luxury items as devices of emulation, competition and even friendship, in the context of the rising middle class. As such, the use of luxury, for both men and women, was no longer seen as a sign of corruptibility, but rather emerging as a positive symbol of civility, and mastery over the natural world, which did not assume its traditional association with scorn and public censure. This did not mean however that the old vices had vanished completely, and Veblen points out the irony that while the Victorian attitudes towards 'luxury' were more inclusive, the vices associated with the traditional notion of 'luxury' still existed, albeit in a modified form. This is exemplified in his description of the boudoir accessories, which "mostly take the form of the conspicuous and unproductive expenditure of a large pecuniary outlay....It aggrandizes the possessor without conferring corresponding material benefit on the social activities at large."
