I found a better case study in another book store called Additionally, Here I spent around two hours observing the shopping public. Although also not very busy, Most of the interaction was situated around the counter, where there was constant conversation between customers and one of the many members of the shop's personnel. The atmosphere in the shop is of the style of a 'walk-in shopping centre'. Many people come in to look around briefly, and nearly everybody does this by themselves. The counter downstairs is placed in the middle of the shop, presumably to make it easier for the personnel to make sure no theft takes place. Classical music sounds throughout the store; not the type of sensitive piano music, but rather dynamic orchestra music. However, the music is played quite softly, so that I observed no noticeable response to the music of customers or personnel.
