To gain weight, it is necessary to increase metabolism, as by increasing metabolic rate we can increase the amount of energy we can expend. Metabolic rate is the speed at which food is broken down by the body and the body operates to maintain its set point. Metabolic rate can be divided into two main areas, the basal metabolic rate (BMR), and the resting metabolic rate (RMR). Although BMR influences the rate at which food is broken down, it is genetically predetermined and so cannot be wilfully altered depending upon the time of day. However, RMR can be influenced through eating behaviour (Melby, Scholl, Edwards & Bullough, 1993).
