The title of David Landes' seminal 1998 work 'The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why some are so rich and some so poor' encapsulates the prevalent question among modern society of why there is such a great disparity of wealth between countries. With the benefit of hindsight, events such as the Industrial Revolution have contributed to a Eurocentric opinion of western superiority, at least until the development of modern North America. However, in the year 1300 this was not the case as in actual fact East Asia possessed a more advanced society than anywhere in the West. During the early modern period, Asian technological and agricultural innovations were envied by Europe, for at this point Europe was no more likely than East Asia to experience an industrialisation process. The economic divergence between East and West However, many of these claims are rather over-enthusiastic in their emphasis. Whilst European climate was more suitable to agricultural productivity, Asia's technological advantage counteracted this through the creation of irrigation systems. In fact, the West adopted several of their inventions. The first two sections of this essay will focus upon demonstrating that these two factors can be encompassed- like many other explanations- within the greatest reason for slow Asian economic progress: attitude. The comparative superiority of East Asia in 1300 meant that competitive spirit was not fostered in the same manner as Europe, and that attempts to regulate their admirable systems enforced an introverted society based on centralised state control, Sino centric governmental policies and hierarchy. The final section portrays how the effects of this attitude accumulated across most facets of East Asian society creating a rather stagnant economy, not conducive to the burgeoning trade and emerging global networks that Europe was able to exploit.
