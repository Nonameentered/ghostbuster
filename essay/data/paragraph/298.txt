In this dissertation it is argued that the development of critical realism by Roy Bhaskar is a positive development for sociology. By successfully critiquing empiricism Bhaskar has developed an approach that can be used to highlight the deficiencies that have been associated with the traditional ontologies available in sociology. It will be shown that Margaret Archer effectively launched an immanent critique of the said sociological ontologies by using the realist ontology. It is also argued that she has constructed a worthwhile methodological complement to the realist ontology. The dissertation then attempts to prove these claims through a discussion of three of the most famous expositions of the concept of power. However, it is through these discussions that it is revealed that sociology will not have to sacrifice its critical character by adopting the realist ontology This is because there will inevitably be disagreement over the 'essentially contested' nature of our familiar concepts. In conclusion, the view will be advanced that the ascendancy of realism within sociology would provide us with a strong foundation from which to develop a body of theories and empirical evidence which would allow us to make a worthwhile contribution to the developments in society, and not just in the academe.
