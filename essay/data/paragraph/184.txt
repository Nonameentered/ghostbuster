A closer view on the interplay which holds "the code" together reveals certain clear similarities between it and other societies. As the environment of the "halfway house" is one in which much deviant behaviour takes place, it follows that, in order to create or at least maintain a system of order, enforcement is necessary. This enforcement uses a variety of methods to control behaviour, including 'disciplinary sanctions and rewards, sanctions and rewards postulated as decisional strategies of gaining compliance' (Cicourel 1973: 9-10). In the case of the "code system", residents comply with the accepted norms of behaviour, such as loyalty to other residents, in order to benefit from it. In doing so, they couple with 'an individual's need to maintain recognition of his/her self-identity' (David in Cicourel 1973: 14). That is, he or she 'immediately enters into a relationship of a collective body in order to manifest a tangible identity' (David in Cicourel 1973: 14). However, such an identity has to be flexible and readily transferable. 'The "defensive esteem' of self is ordinarily achieved by the adherence to sources of evaluation which are socially organized and have certain general acceptance' (Cicourel 1973: 14). These expressions, virtually logically, are accomplished through the adherence to the convict code, which 'serves the same purposes as the disciplines of religion, art, literature, folklore and other humanistic activities, that is, to provide an occasion for meaningful patterns of accomplishment and achievement' (David in Cicourel 1973: 15).
