Our study establishes new data in the area of coping because, to our knowledge, there have been no other studies focusing on avoidance coping and alcohol consumption specifically within the student population. Furthermore, our study differs from many others in the fact that we focus purely on one area - that of academic workload - when the vast majority of coping studies ask participants to specify a particular event of their choice that they found stressful, and analyse responses and coping strategies used in terms of whether the situation was appraised as changeable or unchangeable. We decided to structure our study in this manner because a general link between alcohol consumption and the use of avoidant coping strategies has already been established, and we therefore wanted to see if this general conclusion would apply to one specific situation with which all students are familiar. We feel this issue is of particular relevance since drinking alcohol and working are arguably the two main activities that dominate the lives of many students, and our results may provide preliminary evidence indicating that excessive alcohol consumption may be detrimental to the attitudes of students towards academic work.
