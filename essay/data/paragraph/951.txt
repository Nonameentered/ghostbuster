Milgram's warning--that when an individual "merges...into an organizational structure, a new creature replaces autonomous man, unhindered by the limitations of individual morality, freed of human inhibition, mindful only of the sanctions of authority"--has much resonance. We did not need Milgram to tell us we have a tendency to obey orders but we did need a reminder of just how powerful this tendency is. As we have now been enlightened about our extreme readiness to obey authorities, we can attempt to better guard ourselves against unwelcome or reprehensible commands.
