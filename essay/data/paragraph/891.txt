As well as the government raising morale and patriotism throughout Stalin's championing of Russia, posters and war films were used to raise morale in the population. 'To rally the people to their struggle against the invaders,â€¦ government propaganda swung into full action." True accounts of individual soldiers' heroic battles or suffering for the Motherland were told through newspapers and radio broadcasts. Posters were also designed to show the individual soldier other with patriotic slogans. Nationalist songs were an important way of boosting morale. Choirs sung patriotic songs for soldiers going to the front line. 'The communal singing of songs such as 'Smuglyanka' and 'Katysha' could reach dozens of trainloads of soldiers all at once.' This is effective because the main way of communication were through radios and posters. The songs allowed the Russian people to sing together and contributed to the united feeling of the nation.
