Piaget (as cited in Rubin, LeMare and Lollis, 1990) offers another environmental explanation as to why some children may be more popular than others. He suggests that children who become popular have successfully negotiated mutually engendered behaviours. Because young children are egocentric to learn how to interact and become socially efficient they need to lose the belief that the world centres around them and develop a theory of mind (as cited in Rubin, 1990). Early play and reciprocal friendship allow perspective taking skills and prosocial behaviours to develop, which are important skills to be popular and socially accepted (as cited in Rubin, 1990). This has implications for children who do not have the opportunity to socialise at an early age as may not completely abolish the notion of egocentrism. It also means important cognitive and social skills are not being developed. This is supported by the fact that Dekovic and Gerris (1994) found that rejected children demonstrated more egocentric, selfish behaviours This offers a suggestion as to why children may not exhibit prosocial behaviour but it still does not explicitly offer a cause. Is it opportunity that prevents early socialisation, and if so should this just not occur at preschool, or is it personality which prevents early socialisation or is it attachment type and not feeling secure enough to socialise.
