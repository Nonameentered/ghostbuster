Florence appears to have had much influence on the developments of the Italian Renaissance. Jocelyn Hunt, however, has argued that 'it may be the case that historians have examined the features which made Florence exceptional, and calculated that these are the essential preconditions for the Renaissance' In this case, it would appear that the importance of Florence has been exaggerated. In the early stages of the Italian Renaissance, in the late thirteenth to early fourteenth centuries, 'Florence had a relatively minor role' Florence had no unique connection with antiquity as Rome did. Its claims to antiquity were 'easily matched or surpassed by many other Italian cities' It has been suggested that 'the new age began in Padua and the other urban communes of northern Italy in the 14th century, where lawyers and notaries imitated ancient Latin style and studied Roman archaeology' Petrarch, perhaps the most influential figure of the Renaissance, never lived and worked in Florence. He achieved much greater fame as a writer than his Florentine equivalent, Salutati.
