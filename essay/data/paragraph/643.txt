In conclusion it is clear to see that when examining women's economic position and the personal factors which arose from this, that the gap between theory and practice in the social position of women in early modern England was created by both women and men. The proper role of the wife, envisaged by both scripture and the law, was too restrictive to be attainable. It lacked the realism and accepted the existence of the double standard nature of society of the time, ignoring women's capabilities and desires. The contradictions between sexual control and passive obedience and the emphasis placed on the women as having to act 'female', as well as being expected to take their place in a male-run legal system, made it impossible to remain in the position suggested.
