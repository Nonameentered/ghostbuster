The specificity of haemagglutination lies in the interaction between the virus and the host cell's surface. The virus binds to receptors on the host cell and as these receptors or domains differ in shape and complexity, a type of virus can only interact with certain host cells. This brought about this precise interaction. There are two main domains: a complex polypeptide motif or a simpler carbohydrate motif. In haemagglutination, it is due to binding to a carbohydrate motif.
