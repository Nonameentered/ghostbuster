On Friday afternoon, the 26 My first intention was to observe activity and interaction in a second hand book shop, paying special attention to variables such as gender and age, and their potential relation to areas of interest. This, as we will see, proved to be difficult. Also, I intended to record noteworthy or unusual behaviour that might be caused by social circumstances particular to the shop.
