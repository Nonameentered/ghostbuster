I have decided the pantograph should run a relatively high voltage of 750v, which is at the top of the scale of the HSE's guidelines without requiring further insulation. I've decided higher voltage is better because of the reduced losses. The current drawn will be DC, because the motor will be easier to control that way with fewer losses that resistors in an AC motor. Also DC doesn't produce inductance in the wire, though this may not be such an issue in this application, even with AC. Insulation will be limited to silicon rubber strips because of the small gaps required between live wire and earthed frame. The material is both safe and durable and will withstand bad weather. I have chosen copper as the main conductor because it is cheap at the moment and have good conductivity and ductility. Aluminium may be considered at a later stage if the price of copper goes up. Multithread, flat copper wire would be best to stop breakages and give extra flexibility. Clamp connectors will be used to join wires together, but conductive paste may have to be used to keep contacts clean when operating.
