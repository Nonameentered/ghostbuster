A different perspective on madness can be found within the working class, largely disregarded in nineteenth century psychiatry. A predominating view of the time was that 'insanity was an expensive disease' Whilst middle and upper class women were retiring to bed with various nervous afflictions, their working class counterparts were busy working to support their families; hence they suffered the dual oppression of class and gender in the suppression of their activities and outlets. This created friction between the desired standards the working class strived to emulate and the reality of what they could achieve given their limited economic and social means, inevitably leading to feelings of frustration and helplessness. Whereas uncontrollable sexuality was a key feature of middle class madness, assumed moral weakness of the working class was the main reason given as the cause of their madness, asserting that 'Poverty was, after all, one of the moral causes of insanity'. Though both showed similar symptoms, the latter was considered a 'more prestigious and attractive form of female nervousness than hysteria'
