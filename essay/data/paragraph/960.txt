Avery effective method of In Vivo Exposure is flooding. Flooding is a process by which the patient is exposed to their feared object or situation for an extended period with no break from it. It has been found to be very effective but it is almost impossible to find patient willing to be put through this kind of treatment. There are also ethical issues involved in whether it is ethical to put a person in a situation which can cause physical and mental harm to the patient. (Atkinson, R. L., Atkinson, R. C., Smith, E. E., Bem, D. J., and Nolen-Hoeksema, S., 2000)
