The results were then compared with an external criterion. Aldert Vrij conducted a study to assess the quality of this criteria and to ensure that any results found with the new method were valid (Vrij & Mann, 2001). The researchers applied their criteria of nonverbal behaviours to a set of photographs and found that experienced human judges could indeed identify basic behaviour correctly, some of the more complex behaviours less so. This adds an external validity to the study, until it is trumped by other methods.
