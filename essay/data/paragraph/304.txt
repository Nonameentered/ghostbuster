Chapter three will be devoted to an exposition and then criticism of the theories of power proffered by Mills and Parsons from an ontologically realist perspective, whilst an alternative morphogenetic approach to studying the substantive problems identified by Mills and Parsons will be provisionally sketched. Chapter four will assess Lukes' 'Three-Dimensional' (3-D) view of power from the realist perspective, yet will also seek to show how much of the critical dialogue regarding Lukes' view derives from the way he inappropriately subsumes many of the different applications of the concept of 'power' in to his 3-D view, and not from his ontological misconceptualisations.
