Having looked at the various factors that brought about the fascination seventeenth and eighteenth century Europeans had for Chinese luxury goods, it is fitting to review developments in pre-seventeenth century Europe that are likely to have contributed to this fascination. We must begin by examining the medieval notion of the Far East which had been built up thanks to Marco Polo's exploits and The Flashing Sea, a collection of Chinese courtly tales, which stimulated the European imagination and perception of the Chinese Empire. This longstanding association with the marvellous, mysterious and distant other continued through to the Renaissance and the Baroque periods, and as Vainker argued, this "stimulated the West even more thirstily in pursuit of the products of the East." Thus, this fascination for the Orient was entrenched in the cultural milieu long before the seventeenth century, and provides an important backdrop to the changes in the luxury trade from the seventeenth century onwards.
