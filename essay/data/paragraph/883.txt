After defeating the White Army, the Bolsheviks were forced to 'surrender before its own peasantry." The New Economic Policy was introduced because of the threat mass unpopularity caused to the Bolsheviks, illustrating that the greater struggle was with popular movement because the Bolsheviks were forced to make changes to please the Greens. Although the Whites did pose a threat to the Reds, they were divided, lacked morale and had weak communication lines. The Green and Red fight lasted longer, therefore there was more of a 'struggle'. Brovkin argues that 'military and strategic factors are far less important than popular attitudes in a civil war." The Red and White war was a far more military and strategic war, and the Green and Red a war of popular opinion. Brovkin concludes that 'the available evidence suggests...the magnitude of the Bolshevik war against the peasants on the internal front eclipsed by far the frontline civil war against the Whites.'
