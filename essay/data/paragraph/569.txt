Legionnaires' disease is primarily caused by inhalation of the bacterium, Aerosols are composed mainly of contaminated droplets, typically less than 5 Î¼m in diameter, generated by sources such as hot tubs, showers and air conditioning units (5). These droplets can be carried considerable distances from the infected source and when inhaled They are too small to settle out of the air and hence cause infection (6). Legionellosis is found mainly in moist, humid environments and is associated with natural water courses, land based reservoirs, hospitals and air conditioning systems due to the presence and subsequent growth of To appreciate the effects and characteristics of Legionellosis, we must firstly understand the various processes that it undergoes during transmission. Bhardwaj et al. (1) shed some light on this by studying the transmission routes of when it is at various stages of its growth cycle. When Legionella organisms exist in the external environment, they are disseminated to the primary host cell, alveolar macrophages, by the inhalation of
