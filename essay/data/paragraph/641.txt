Finally, a large part of why the social position prescribed in early modern England fell apart, despite people's efforts to stick by it, was due to the  dualities and contradictions it contained. Women were expected to be both obedient and commanding, both submissive and authoritative. 'Conventions of behaviour were such that female household authority entailed an authoritative but not authoritarian style.' Several writers criticised the way authority was wielded by mistresses; 'Gentlewomen were expected to command without dominating, while servants were expected to obey without accepting domination...mistresses should never have made servants feel too keenly their authority". These situations demanded a certain malleability and confidence in negotiating balanced authority, which could not be achieved if women were to simply follow the role they were taught.
