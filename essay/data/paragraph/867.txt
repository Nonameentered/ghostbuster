Davis et al, (1977) generated fifteen social decision scheme matrices to investigate which provided the most accurate fit to their data. To gain the data Davis et al asked participants to watch a videoed case of a rape trial. Participants were then randomly spilt into six member juries and asked to find a verdict. As a general finding, Davis et al (1977) found that the verdict initially favoured by the majority, was predominantly the jury's final verdict. What is important however is that when there was a three by three spilt in the initial verdict preference, there was a strong tendency for acquittal and a near zero tendency to convict. This illustrates that in most cases a majority rule social decision scheme can be implemented, but it needs to have a sub scheme allowing for this leniency bias (MacCoun and Kerr, 1988) This was termed matrix D15, "defendant protection, hung otherwise" (Davis et al, 1977).
