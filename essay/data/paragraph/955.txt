The behaviourist approach is useful as it attempts to isolate past events that have produced certain behaviour. The advantages to the behaviourist approach are that it fits in with general scientific approaches and is based on a considerable amount of research evidence. This approach shows how reinforcement from the environment can shape behaviour. For example, being rewarded for displaying a certain behaviour means that this behaviour is likely to continue. Behaviourists look to establish cause and effect relationships seeing exactly how, for example, reward and punishments produce and shape behaviour. It is one of the few approaches in psychology that leads directly to successful treatments of various psychological disorders. (Mackenzie, B. D.1977)
