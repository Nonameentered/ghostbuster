In Milgram's experiment, it was predicted that only one in a thousand would continue to the end. In fact, 26 out of 40 subjects continued until the end. It must be stated that although there were many protests from the subjects especially when the learner started to cry out in pain, none of the subjects ceased obeying the experimenter when prodded to continue. Milgram had essentially gotten 100% obedience out of his subjects.
