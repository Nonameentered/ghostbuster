In conclusion, the endosymbiotic theory is supported by a wide variety of evidence, both from molecular studies on eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and from observations of phylogenetics. The double membrane organisation of mitochondrial and chloroplastic organelles suggests that the origin of these organelles was associated with the engulfment of an exogenous prokaryote, followed by the permanent assimilation of the engulfed prokaryote without any cytoplasmic mixing. It is further supported by similarities in the morphology, structure, function, genetics, and phylogenetics of these organelles; the distinct possession of cytoplasmic and nuclear genes by both organelles, the presence of non-chromatophoric organelles such as hydrogenosomes and the requirement of oxygen from the environment, all of which are found only in eukaryotes. However, the origin of the eukaryotic undulipodia from endosymbiotic bacteria is still being disagreed upon, although it is fast becoming more accepted by molecular biologists.
