However, Winstanley's belief in a transcendent and immanent God does not make him less of a religious radical, despite what Mulligan et al. seem to imply Mulligan et al. appear keen to make Winstanley out to be a traditional millenarian, and this is reinforced by their interpretation of Winstanley's understanding of the Fall and Restoration, which is fairly similar to the traditional Christian understanding of it. Unlike Hill's radical Winstanley who believed that the introduction of private property constituted the Original Sin The scales seem to be tipped against Mulligan et al. as Zagorin's Winstanley saw Man's redemption "not in a heaven to come, and not through Christ's vicarious sacrifice, but by the restoration of the absolute law of reason." Aylmer too, acknowledged Winstanley's unorthodoxy in asserting that the Original Sin was not a historical event, nor was it inherited from Adam, but rather, it was "the defeat of good by evil, which is repeated in all of us..." The notion of an internal as opposed to historic and external Fall, Resurrection and Restoration is certainly radical, not to mention also that the Restoration would be complete only when Second Adam (within) kills the First Adam in us, and this inward restoration will be manifested outwardly in the abolishing of Private Property, and the re-establishment of the earth as a common treasury In using biblical concepts as metaphors to criticise the inequality prevalent in his society, Winstanley ended up creating his own brand of Christian heresy. While the need to substantiate his social critiques and ideas with biblical references is perhaps traditional, in the sense that he acknowledged the authority of the Bible and used it as a legitimising force for his ideas; his use of it is far from conventional, as seen from Winstanley's unorthodox understanding of the Fall and Restoration.
