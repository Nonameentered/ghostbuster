Racism is still a problem within our society today, and many ethnic minorities face inequalities in many areas, including education, housing, and employment. Ethnic minorities are concentrated into certain areas of the job market, such as manufacture and communication (Brown, 1992), are most likely to be the victims of assault (Abercrombie et al, 1994), and recent surveys have shown that racist ideas still exist in society. This can be seen in a survey, carried out in 1993, that asked a white sample whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement: 'Immigration has enriched the quality of life in Britain' and nearly half of the sample disagreed (Abercrombie et al, 1994, p255).
