Another problem is that the social decision scheme does not take into account situational factors which may effect which scheme is most appropriate. As an example of this, Davis (1975) (as cited in Davis et al, 1977) found that on a different set of data, matrix D15 was not the most effective predictor of the data, matrix D7, the "simple majority hung" matrix provided a better fit. This can also be shown by the fact that Schonemann (1979) found that a ridiculous matrix (where the probability of a guilty verdict is inversely related to the number of jurors favouring it), fitted Davis et al's (1977) data perfectly. Schonemann's (1979) point in illustrating this was to show that a social decision scheme could fit the data perfectly without being plausible.
