These desires for a lifestyle that does not involve children have been made possible by small changes in employment structures, which mean that women can now have a career, and the emergence of discourses, albeit not mainstream ones which allow women greater sexual freedom. Gillespie describes this as 'the post-modern model of reproduction', in which social forces have impacted upon motherhood, meaning that that it is becoming disaggregated with the natural (2001), so motherhood is no longer seen as synonymous with femininity. This shows that as well as there being personal, economic and social factors influencing the decision not to have children, changes in employment structures and new discourses emerging on motherhood and reproduction mean that these factors are possible in modern society. Therefore it is a complex combination of social ideals and personal responses that results in women becoming voluntarily childless.
