It is important to bear in mind that the information stated in this essay is by no means a definitive account of what newborns 'know' during their first year of life. However, they do seem to have a lot more innate capabilities that are to do with the people around them, as opposed to their knowledge of the objects around them, which seems to be limited at birth. This may due to the fact that even from within the womb, babies are in contact with the outside world via the voices they hear and thus learning may even begin from here. Conversely, their ability to experience and perceive objects whilst in the womb is impossible, which would explain their gradual development towards perceptual aspects of objects.
