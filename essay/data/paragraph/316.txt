Individualism cannot successfully prove that social structures are not, "autonomous from, pre-existent to, and do not exert a causal influence over individuals" (as both realism and collectivism state) (Archer, 1995; 42). Individualism posits that social structure is not independent from individuals because the social structure is constituted of interpersonal relations (Archer, 1995; 43). However, this does not take into account that social structures condition behaviour, for example in the form of role fulfilment. Individualism refutes the validity of this criticism by denying the pre-existence of social structure; it claims that features such as 'roles' only exist because the individuals concerned lack the desire or the knowledge to change them (Archer, 1995; 44). Archer disproves this claim by discussing the resistance shown by structures (such as the rate of recruitment into the police force) to the concerted efforts of individuals trying to change them; this proves that structures pre-exist and outlive specific individuals and their attempts to alter them by showing that they possess properties independent of the individual's influence (Archer would also add that the process of 'role fulfilment' by actors is structurally Additionally, it can be argued that the dispositions which are so important to individualism are shaped and restricted by their historical context (Gellner, 1971, in Archer, 1995; 42). Consequently, individualism cannot maintain that structures do not have a causal influence (such as a low level of recruitment into the police force being causal of a high crime rate in urban areas). Although collectivism is not susceptible to the criticisms of individualism's methodological approach, it does not offer a significant counter-ontology, and is therefore inferior to the realist approach.
