There are other ways to explain the non-significant main effect of accuracy. Social facilitation research in the past, including the inaugural Triplett study, involved physical tasks. For example, Martens and Landers (1968) and Carment (1970), found that in a muscle endurance task performed alone, in pairs or in groups of four, greater endurance was shown in the pairs or groups of 4 than in the individual performance. Physical tasks have no need to be measured in terms of their accuracy, so it could be that social facilitation only involves an increase in speed, not in the quality of the task. This is perhaps why sporting events are so successful, and work so well - participants are able to directly view the calibre of their competition. The non-significant accuracy result can, therefore, still be supported by research. This experiment involved a written task, but may have provided different results if answers were made more public, for example if participants had to call out their answers, or if they had to respond to an audio stimulus. One could object, however, that performance in a very simple task such as the one used in this experiment can not possibly be a predictor of people's complex and varied behaviour in real life. Equally, though, this can be countered, as one could argue that if the effects of social facilitation demonstrate themselves at such a simple level, the repercussions for more complex behaviour could be far greater. Something to consider may be to enlarge the differences between the group sizes in order to obtain a more pronounced effect. Instead of one, two and five people in each condition, perhaps doubling the number each time, for example testing five, ten and twenty people would demonstrate a more definite relationship between response times as an effect of group size. It is possible that after a certain level is reached, social facilitation and mere presence effects no longer have influence behaviour.
