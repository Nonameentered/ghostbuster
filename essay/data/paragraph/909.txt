The term 'meme' was first introduced by Richard Dawkins in 1976. Dawkins popularised the influential view that evolution is best understood in terms of competition between genes (Blackmore, 1999), and in his conception of memes he takes this one step further, drawing on the analogy between genetic and cultural evolution to claim that culture can be split into units called memes; ideas, habits, skills, stories or any kind of behaviour or information that is copied from person to person by imitation (Dawkins, 1976). Memes are the replicators of the cultural world; the smallest elements of culture or complex ideas that replicate themselves with reliability and fecundity (Dennett, 1993). Like genes, memes are selfish. They pursue their own interests and are concerned only with their survival and replication. Since each mind has a limited capacity for memes, there is considerable competition among memes for entry into as many minds as possible (Ball, 1984). Dawkins urges us to take the idea of meme evolution literally; it is not just analogous to biological or genetic evolution (Dennett, 1990), but a phenomenon that obeys the laws of natural selection exactly, and is achieving evolutionary change at a rate that leaves conventional genetic evolution far behind (Dawkins, 1976).
