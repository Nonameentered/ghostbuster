The evidence dovetails nicely, showing that caution should be taken rather than concern being expressed. The implications of viewed aggression on both the immediate and long term behaviour of children, and the possibility of children imitating behaviours seen on television in line with Bandura's social learning theory, are apparent. While the majority of studies cited isolate a core link between viewed aggression and aggression in action or cognitions, research does also exist that denies this link - research highlighting the folly of blame reductionism and the greater influence of factors other than the media on behaviour. Conclusively, the relationship between viewed aggression and aggression in action and cognitions is a controversial one, often made more uncertain by public opinion. This essay has attempted to delineate research which links television violence to displayed aggression and antisocial behaviour in children and that which suggests it has little effect by means of the above findings.
