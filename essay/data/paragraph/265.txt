The aggressive attitude of the WSPU in addition to the lack of united support by the other suffrage organisations could have been another contributing factor. For although some were radicalised by the WSPU and its militancy, others distanced themselves from such strategy. That is to say, whilst violence of the WSPU promoted clarity and undivided discussion on the suffrage question, it could simultaneously be argued that it aggravated the anti-suffragists and ended up increasing the opposition (Vicinus 1985). The NUWSS further argued against potential desensitisation of the public against the suffragettes, as it feared the militants would become increasingly alienated from the public (Harrison 1978).
