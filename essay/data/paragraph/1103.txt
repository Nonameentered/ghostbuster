The implications of luxury did not merely pertain to the self and society, but were of national importance, as it affected the material and nonmaterial well being of the nation. The suspicions generated about 'luxury' are perhaps in part the product of its association with 'foreignness' The advocates of the Scottish Enlightenment, David Hume and Adam Smith were keen to challenge this antediluvian attitude and promote luxury as a "progressive social force" As Hume argues persuasively "...in most nations foreign trade has preceded a refinement in home manufactures, and given birth to domestic luxury...and their delicacy and industry being once awakened, carry them on to further improvements in every branch of domestic as well as foreign trade." A classic example would be the stimulus that the Wedgwood pottery industry received from the East-West trade in porcelain, which created the market for fine dinner services that Wedgwood was able to capitalize on in the mid eighteenth century. It is often the argument employed by the advocates of luxury (notably Mandeville) that the demand for luxury would "lead to the expansion of commerce and the wider employment of the poor"
