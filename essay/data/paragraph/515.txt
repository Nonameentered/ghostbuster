Firstly casein. The method we used was indirectly determining the isoelectric point by measuring the absorbance of varying concentrations of acetic acid with casein. The results we received indicate that the isoelectric point of casein is around 5.04. This value is logical and in agreement with accepted values of the isoelectric point of casein, however due to the nature of the experiment the value can only be considered as approximate. To increase the accuracy of this value, further dilutions of the acetic acid and small variations to the pH could be used to identify the exact point at which the net charge on the casein molecule is neutral.
