The people living within these areas were made even more vulnerable to these risks, as they become largely cut off from other cities where the service sector is now dominating, meaning they were excluded from job information networks and fell into a downward spiral ending in a culture of unemployment (Ashton and Maguire, 1991). These reasons have all combined to ensure that over the past thirty years people living in these industrial areas have been more affected by unemployment.
