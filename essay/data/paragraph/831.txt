The terms "reliability" and "validity" as defined by quantitative methods are not fitting to qualitative research. To try and impose them onto qualitative analysis reduces the individuality and significance of the qualitative method. The studies often involve analysis of individual transcripts and because you do not get identical individuals it is unreasonable to expect the study to be repeated and identical results achieved (Merrick, 1999). This does not however mean that the research is not of high quality and trustworthy. Once measured against a criterion more fitting to the qualitative method, the quality of the research can be fully established. With validity it is possible to establish whether the researcher is actually measuring what is there by using techniques to reduce researcher bias.
