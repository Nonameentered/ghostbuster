The potential of stem cells is not limited to the growth of human cells, and recently adult stem cells have become popular in research studies. It was due to this that the Sloan-Kettering Institute published evidence of the ability of the adult stem cells to generate daughter cells that were committed to a fixed fate (8). This finding suggested to researchers that adult stem cells were naturally capable of differentiating and may therefore offer a potential solution to growing specialist cell types for therapeutic uses.
