Salthouse (2000) has concluded that many tasks include contributions from both generalised slowing and task specificity, and so we should be cautious of viewing these interpretations as mutually exclusive theories of age-related performance change. Therefore, although more empirical work is required, more theoretical work would also be needed in order to identify the best approach for explaining the observed age differences (McDowd & Shaw, 2000). It has been suggested that task-specific processes may be useful in expanding our understanding of selective attention in older people as it may influence the degree of age-related slowing. Therefore, we may even be able to produce measures to decrease the amount of age-related slowing that it occurring (Madden et al., 1992). It is also important to bear in mind that most evidence for the generalised slowing hypothesis is based on reaction time data and that this can not be the sole measure for selective attention.
