Another reason why Florence took a leading role in the developments of the Italian Renaissance was the relationship between patrons and artists in Florence which was 'remarkable by comparison with conditions in other circles' There was a friendly understanding between them which was in part due to classical texts which exalted the artist and emphasized the esteem that they received in ancient times. These texts 'were not lost on the Florentines' The relationship between Cosimo and Donatello 'went much deeper than that of employer and employee' Cosimo gave Donatello a pension in his old age, which was the first known instance of this type of help given to an artist. The 'championing of artists by Florence's most prominent citizen naturally raised their status' Artists in Florence were allowed to use their own genius. Leonardo was educated in Medici Florence and was 'the culmination of the versatile artist whose rise took place in the city by the Arno' When he moved to Milan, however, he was not understood. He painted the Leonardo replied that 'men of genius sometimes accomplish most when they work least' Similarly, in Rome, relations between patron and artist were not as amiable as in Florence. Cronin notes how 'painters were lumped together with carters and grooms' The artist Davide Ghirlandaio was served uneatable food while working in the abbey of Passignano and was so angry that he dumped his soup over the friar and beat him with the loaf of bread
