In Italy, painters, sculptors and masons often belonged to guilds. In some places, such as Milan and Florence, painters had their own guilds. Most of these were quite restrictive. For example, the guild in Padua forbade members to give or sell to non-members and did not allow work to be brought from another district to be sold in Padua.

The government held that not every craftsman had to join and it allowed people from other places to work in Florence. Peter Burke believes that 'this more liberal policy, which exposed local tradition to stimuli from outside, may help to explain Florence's cultural lead'
