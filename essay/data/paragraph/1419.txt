When making decisions on equipments, Nick should consider the following: • The cost of materials and labour, that is, any extra costs of installing the new pipe. • The ability for the turbine/generator to make use of the increased flow rate. • The ability to make use of any subsidies and grants available. • How long the pipe and other components will last, and the cost of replacing them. • The potential long-term revenue streams and profits. • Any legal requirements to connect to the grid and the cost and implications of this. • The reliability of the turbine/generator, and any measures that can be taken to increase it. • The ability of the system to work with minimal manual intervention, in order to maximise ease of use. • The ability to earn ROCs and make use of dump loads. • Any environmental effects the installation may have on the local wildlife, and if/how these can be mitigated.
