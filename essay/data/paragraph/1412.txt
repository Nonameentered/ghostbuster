In conclusion, upgrading Nick Mills' pipe from 4 to 6 inch would cost approximately ~ By going through with this upgrade, Nick will be able to access a larger proportion of the water flow of the river at any given time, with an estimated performance increase of 29%. In regards to the profitability of the upgrade, an estimate of 20 year to payback has been made, given that Nick Mills is already set up for a small hydro scheme and connected to the national grid. If Nick is to take advantage of renewable obligation certificates (ROCs), a dump load will be required to use the electricity available at times when less is being used, and again, the payback in this situation would be lowered.
