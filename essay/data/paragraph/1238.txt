Given the above data, one could conclude that age-related reduces in inhibition is the cause for the age difference performance for selective attention tasks, however, critics suggest that as with any correlational study merely observing a reduction in RT does not necessarily mean that inhibiton is reduce but may simply be indicative of generalised-slowing (Salthouse, 1991). According to Salthouse (1991), any age difference that does not conform to a linear relationship or when reduced across the age range should be interpreted as evidence of specific rather than general slowing. Salthouse (1991) also suggested that age differences should only be seen as evidence of generalised-slowing if two conditions are meet: 1) RT and age must have a linear relation, and 2) that the magnitude of the age difference must remain constant across age range.
