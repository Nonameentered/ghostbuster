The second set of factors which made the social position set out for women in early modern England impossible to fulfil even if they tried, were personal factors. By this I mean factors which come about naturally as a consequence of marriage; i.e. spending a lot of time with someone, growing to know them very well and loving them. Love and caring were seen as very important aspects of a successful marriage, in particular they were seen as part of a husband's duty. However it was well documented in contemporary literature that '...more men betrayed their command through their own fondness than ever lost it through their wives rebellion'. 'Convention demanded that the wife address her husband with humility and deference...even the affectionate terms love, joy, dear and duck were not appropriate in the mouth of a subordinate." However it must have been very difficult to maintain a purely master/subordinate relationship especially when feelings of love and affection existed in a marriage. Even the most obedient wife and most masterful husband must have come across occasions when such formal address would have been inappropriate.
