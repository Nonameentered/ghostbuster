Lastly, Davis insists that creativity and reinterpretation of seventeenth century materials characterise the use of the 'Ranter' myth by twentieth-century Marxists. There is no denying that others have used the myth for political gains, and that it has continued to be a fruitful source for interpretive exercises on the effect of politics on history. But such exercises do not invalidate the possibility of the 'Ranters' themselves as existing without being created by interest groups or belief systems. The survival of the 'Ranter' myth might just be due to its great entertainment value, though past stories may need to be embellished and exaggerated in order to fit the tastes of modern audiences. Though this tendency to plunge into new interpretations and to draw new meanings is admirable, where the 'Ranters' are concerned, it is important to draw the distinction between myth and reality. Until such a distinction is achieved, and Davis is convinced to accept that there was a group of individuals who undoubtedly shared the spiritualistic and antinomian ideas, albeit loosely and without any common ties, this debate will persist.
