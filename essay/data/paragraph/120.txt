Advertisement did not play the least role in this newly constructed female middle class identity. From an early point, advertisers came to accept that 'the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that buys the boots' (Loeb 1994:8). Throughout the second half of the nineteenth century, techniques of persuasion became increasingly refined (McCracken 1990:29), shifting the portrayal of the household mistress in a shape of the 'perfect lady' through images in an often historical, near-mythological style (Loeb 1994). Such portrayal of rather powerful, controlling women attempted to equal the act of shopping to having 'the opportunity to', as a critic wrote disdainfully, '"luxuriate" in a deep and intense "sense of power"' (Rappaport 1996:76).
