Image problems are also common in dementia, whereby the patient has difficulty in accurately judging the size, shape and shape of an object (Levin, 1982, as cited in Morris, 1999). It has been argued that visual imagery deficits in dementia are largely caused by retrieval problems in the semantic memory (Garrard et al., 1999). Research on AD patients has found that they demonstrate difficulties in visual imagery tasks that do not depend on semantic memory (Hodges and Patterson, 1995) suggesting that there is a problem with memory formation, rather than memory retrieval and consistent with the lesion profile of AD (Morris, 2001). Furthermore, visual imagery has important implications in everyday life, not only in terms of the difficulty the patient may have in navigating and performing tasks (Morris, 1999) but also in affecting social interaction as imagined facial expressions can be mistaken for genuine expressions (McDonald et al, 1990 as cited in Levin, 1993).
