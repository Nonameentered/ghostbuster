The government reacted to the demonstrations, strikes and peasant uprisings with some concessions, helping them to settle the people back in to the existing system. The loyalty of the military still remained in place; this was to prove more beneficial for Nicholas in 1917, when officers refused to follow orders to put down worker's protests. That the Tsar still had loyalty from the middle/upper classes, industrialists, the Church, and the army; and could still make concessions to these classes was significant in averting fullscale revolution.
