It is possible that given the rising concerns about the impact our way of life is having on the environment that government may increase its efforts to persuade people to use public/ environmentally friendly modes of transport. If such a campaign were to be successful then light rail and other public transport could become a much more attractive industry. It may be worth waiting for a more favourable climate (in terms of personal transport) before attempting to enter this industry.
