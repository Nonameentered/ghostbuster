An important inspiring agent of the so-called 'orgy of goods' (Loeb 1994:3) of the nineteenth century may be said to have been the Great Exhibition of 1851. The enormous display of unprecedented comforts, luxuries and riches was seen as a 'miracle of material civilisation' (Finn 1998:36) and came to symbolise the aspirations of a nation. Indeed, the exhibition also provided a model for transition from one purchasing audience, the upper classes, to a broad based one (Rappaport 1996:81). At the same time, visiting of such an event also became an expression of middle class gentility. Within a few days over 6 million people visited the exhibition, most of them members of the middle classes (Finn 2000). Those middle class people, seduced by the 'esthetic raptures' (Loeb 1994:4) were able to mix with the upper classes, without feeling embarrassed or excluded by their lower economic standing.
