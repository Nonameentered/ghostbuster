Nick also needs to look at the transformer step-up voltage. The efficiency of the transformer is dependant on its load, and the higher the input voltage, the higher the efficiency. The current transformer has a set 230v AC voltage output, but raising this to 400v AC should improve efficiency. The cost of a 400VAC transformer will depend on the current and the voltage required, and as it is more efficient, it will reduce electricity loss.
