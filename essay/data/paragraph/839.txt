This indicates that the cause of the child being unpopular may be due to the type of child the parent is introducing to the world. A securely attached child is likely to have a secure base and experience to which they can use in their peer encounters, however an anxious or avoidant child may have difficulties forming peer relationships as they will not be secure enough to do this. The important factor here however is that the attachment with the parent does not guarantee popularity. It is the type of child the parent is introducing which does, as a securely attached child is likely to be confident and have a secure enough base to explore and make social advances. This does start from the family however and if the child has not had the opportunity to learn the important cognitive and social skills then it is unlikely they will find socialising and making friends and hence being popular easy.
