The point at which all the viable cells in the culture were growing and dividing is shown by the exponential phase (i.e. between forty minutes and one hundred and twenty minutes on the graph). It is only during this phase that calculations regarding the rate of growth can be calculated (for example the specific growth rate and the doubling time). The values for these two growth rates were calculated to be 0.912 absorbance increase per hour and 0.760 hours respectively. The doubling time value is confirmed from our graph. It took approximately forty minutes for the initial absorbance to double i.e. approximately the same time as the calculated doubling time value of 0.760 hours.
