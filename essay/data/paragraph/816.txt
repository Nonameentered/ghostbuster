The results show then, that first year university students do have significantly more disordered eating than a control group of matched aged non university students, although having to integrate a new peer group and low self esteem are not significant causes of this. This may be because low self esteem and having to integrate a new peer group combine with other factors associated with university life such as stress and depression, which were not measured in this study. It appears then although peers have an influence over body image and dieting behaviour, that it is not necessarily the case that being placed in a new peer group causes disordered eating behaviour, although it should not be underestimated as a contributing variable. It is also advantageous to take into account the fact that educational level is a significant factor in body satisfaction, with girls with higher educational attainments being more satisfied with their bodies (Swami, 2005). The experimental group only had university aged first year students. It may be profitable to compare this group with a group of same aged non university goers in future research. This would give more scope to assess whether being at university is the sole cause for the significant difference in disordered eating levels as opposed to the levels of educational attainment. It is also important to consider the environment in which data was collected. For the experimental group, data was collected from Birmingham City University, although the course area was not specified on the questionnaires. As Birmingham City University was used it may be that the students who completed the questionnaires were from area studies, as this is the predominant subject studied at this university. Area studies
