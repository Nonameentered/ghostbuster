There are several reasons for this decline in male employment. Firstly, they were the main workers in the manufacturing industry, so when this declined their levels of unemployment increased (Ashton and Maguire, 1991). Although the service sector grew to replace manufacturing as a source of employment, women were favoured by employers due to their characteristics, and the way they were perceived as more caring and understanding, and also reliable, especially if they were married (Maguire, 1992). This idea is demonstrated clearly by Ashton and Maguire when they say; 'the new service sector jobs have provided low skilled, part-time and often casual employment, primarily for females' (1991, p53).
