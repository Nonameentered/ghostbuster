In conclusion, it is inadequate to understand imperialism primarily either as an economic or cultural phenomenon, simply because both were secondary concerns in the impetus to colonise. Economic determinism is the prerogative of Marxist historians, and it should be kept this way; for the vast majority of the other historians who have attempted to write about imperialism have placed due recognition to the other factors that have contributed to the motives of imperialism, which provide a more balanced view of this phenomenon. Moreover, the question specifically refers to European, and not British imperialism, hence, the assertion of economic interests as the primary force in imperialism would seem highly Anglo-centric in the light of the arguments put forth in this essay. It is perhaps more accurate to see the economic and cultural aspects as being the consequences of imperialism, and since 'primarily' suggests some sense of causation, it would be myopic to insist upon a direct answer to this question.
