The user requires the engine to act as a means of turning a shaft, which will be attached to the workings of the device. The engine must be able to produce sufficient torque to operate the device in such a manner that the speed of rotation of the shaft does not decrease notably at normal r.p.m. when the device is loaded. Because the device is portable, the engine must reflect this requirement and not be substantially heavier than about 7kg and must have the same moment as the front of the device if resting on someone's shoulder at a shoulder support. The engine should not have more that 3 times the diameter of the device to make sure it does not stand out as an eyesore to the rest of the device or be bulky. The engine should be able to operate in any orientation and not be sensitive to shock or vibration, which it will endure, in daily use. The engine should not leak any dangerous materials or fluids and be free from corrosion in the environment in which it is used. The engine must be easy to start and run. To allow for different circumstances of use, the r.p.m. of the engine must be adjustable by the user and an idle mode should be incorporated to allow the engine to run at a slow speed between uses or short carrying journeys. This may incorporate a centrifugal clutch to stop the device operating at low engine speed. The clutch will help prevent stalling, as the load on the engine remains too great for the decreasing torque caused by reduced r.p.m.
