To support that a social decision scheme of jury deliberations requires a sub scheme allowing for a leniency bias, or an asymmetry effect, MacCoun and Kerr (1988) produced a meta analysis of twelve previous studies of jury deliberations in which there was an equal split of jurors on each jury, initially proposing a guilty or not guilty verdict. They also found that the leniency bias was active when two thirds of the jury initially believe that the verdict should be guilty (MacCoun and Kerr, 1988). In another study by Kerr and MacCoun (1985) they demonstrated that this social decision scheme was also strong enough to consider the size of the jury and that it still produced consistent results whether there were six person or twelve person juries.
