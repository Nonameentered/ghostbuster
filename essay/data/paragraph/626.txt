Mortality was frequently measured as age specific death rates in parish registers and other localised primary evidences. Yet famine and other 'crisis mortality' was often quite hard to identify due to its nature; it was often more prolific in villages rather than Parish registers do often record such events, however this information can only be found in unusually good registers, or by looking at a large number of documents. Mortality did not only manifest itself as famine and starvation; although it often had an underlying role in making famine more or less severe in certain areas, disease was at times the most significant factor. N.H. Appleby found many instances where crop failures coincided with increases in deaths due to disease; this was particularly evident in Scotland and tended to create cyclical epidemics. He argues that the famine of the 1620s and 1690s were most likely caused by diseased cattle which restricted milk all over the country. The most severe example of this however was in the 1790s in many parts of England where the 'cattle murrain' was coincident with war, labour shortages and a tight food market.
