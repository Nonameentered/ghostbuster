More recently, another approach that has arisen from selective attention research has been that of cognitive resources. This approach aims to view attentional processes as resources which can be flexibly allocated as and when needed (Salthouse, 1996). Salthouse (1996) proposed that ageing causes a reduced availability of resources resulting in more efficient distribution of these over a range of cognitive and perceptual activities. This multitasking deficit hypothesis, which is closely related to that of information-processing resource theory (Salthouse, 1991), claims, in simplified terms, that a "decrease in task performance (with age) is the result of the effective competition for resources" (p. 24). Studies have found that if two (or more) tasks are made similar in terms of stages of processing (Salthouse, 1991), then the age-related differences are relatively consistent with the multitasking deficit hypothesis.
