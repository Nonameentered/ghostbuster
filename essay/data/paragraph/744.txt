Thorold Rogers suggests that the ' Black Death was a stimulus towards... the disintegration of the manorial system' Villeins began to feel that their positions were unfair as they could see the high wages of those not bound to their lord by obligation. The 'scales were... tipped against the land owner' Laws such as the Statute of Labourers were passed to protect the landlord by checking increased wages and the free movement of labour. These laws were largely ignored. Landlords also tried to maintain power by stepping up the level of fines in their courts. As a result, 'relations... became more confrontational' In this way, it can be argued that the Black Death caused the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. As Ziegler maintains, 'if there had been no Black Death, tension and bitterness would never have risen by 1381 to the level that it did' The situation after the outbreak of the plague highlighted existing grievances of the peasants and showed up the flaws in the existing system.
