Discussion The data clearly shows that the enzyme has an optimum pH of 9.5 and an optimum temperature of 42 After the optimum the activity of the enzyme decreased steadily with increasing temperature and pH. This is to be expected as at high temperatures enzymes tend to become denatured whilst at extreme pHs the enzyme may lose activity (too acidic or alkaline). The product inhibition results show that phosphate is able to inhibit the activity of the enzyme. This is also expected as phosphate is the product of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme. At higher concentrations of phosphate the enzyme is competitively inhibited meaning that the phosphate is competing with the substrate for the active site.
