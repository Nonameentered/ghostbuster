In reply, General Turgidson asks 'wasn't it Mark Twain who said... that a thousand years from now this world would be a total obliteration'? The audience is left to appreciate that Twain's point has come to pass even sooner than anticipated, as the Great War has already arrived, courtesy of modern science and man's thirst for power. The irrationality of man's ambition can be seen in It is 'the mother of all bombs', capable of being triggered remotely by a combination of three numbers which must be kept secret from each other at all times. Of course, the moral problems of this singular instrument are obvious; just as the alien ship was invulnerable to attack, so is the doomsday machine, succinctly expressed by Mandrake's question, 'How can one possibly threaten the other side with it? It's like welcoming total destruction'. It argues that whilst science has made many advances, there is an increase in human vulnerability rather than security, thus presenting the bomb as the equator of modern life. It is a disastrous human invention that will effect both sides, thus having no possible martial justification
