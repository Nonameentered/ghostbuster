Furthermore I believe that Blackmore's conclusion regarding our concept of the conscious self is largely unbelievable. Blackmore claims that the idea of the continuous, persistent and autonomous self is an illusion; the self is actually just a collection of memes. Memes gain an advantage by becoming associated with a person's self-concept. A 'self' therefore aids their replication. The sense of 'self' has simply been created by the processes of memetic evolution acting in the relatively short period of one human lifetime. Blackmore then goes even further and says that the ways we behave, the choices we make, and the things we say are all a result of complex interactions between memes. There is no inner self which is the initiator of actions, controls the body, or is conscious; thus there is no free will. Blackmore presents an eliminative account of design, mind, and human agency which removes the possibility of voluntary choice or invention on the part of humans (Holdcroft & Lewis, 2001). Intentionality is transferred away from humans and to the memes. Whilst Blackmore has tried to argue against the fact that her argument makes humans completely passive, stating that our intelligence, capacity for making choices, and active social life are all part of the copying environment in which memes compete (Blackmore, 2002), it is hard to see that this could imply anything other than that we are caught up in "a remorseless process in which we are mere pawns" (Jahoda, 2002). I find this aspect of Blackmore's argument hard to accept since it contradicts our very experience of thought and conscious deliberation, and violates the assumption that in making choices we truly have free will and are not influenced or bound by either internal or external forces.
