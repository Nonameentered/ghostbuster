Visuospatial deficits are common in AD (Perry and Hodges, 1999) and can manifest themselves in many seemingly harmless ways to the patient. Prosopagnosia (face blindness) is commonplace in AD and is associated with reduced cerebral metabolism in the right and left ventral occipito-temporal regions (Rosen et al, 1994, as cited in Hodges and Patterson, 1995). As well as being socially awkward, face recognition is also essential in remembering who you are, hence prosopagnosia may lead to an inability to identify oneself and can also result in paranoia due to an inability to differentiate people. The difficulties experienced by the patient have obvious implications for the caregiver, as they become responsible for the safety and well being of the patient. This often places the caregiver under immense strain as the patient's needs have to be catered for, which requires a great deal of understanding of the severity of the psychological effects on the patient, as well as the practical skills needed to care for them (Gilliard, 2001).
