In his 1974 article, Wieder transcribed the "convict code" (the code of accepted behaviour among its participants) of a self-governed, rehabilitative halfway-house for drug addict felons on parole, as it was presented to him by the residents. In doing so, he raises various interesting questions about the precise nature of social norms, and the degree to which they are recursive, fleeting, and fluid. Wieder's piece emphasises a very personal, situational approach to his case study, providing a vivid account of his first impressions of the facility and the everyday behaviour determined by it. Thus, as ethicist Alexander notes, Wieder's piece serves an 'important and serious purpose: not to bury the code but to accept and understand it as an integral part of the overall context within which the study was undertaken' (Alexander 1987: 269).
