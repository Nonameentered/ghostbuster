Perhaps the greatest testament to the power that Chinese luxury goods had to capture and enthrall the Europeans and supply these consumer desires (no matter who they were or that the commodities were removed from their cultural or religious contexts) lies in the fact that, even today, Chinese goods retain these same qualities of refinement and luxury that have spanned the centuries. This is particularly evident in the calligraphic writing, especially in the use of seals and stamp writing, where characters are inscribed in neat panache with sumptuous brush strokes on porcelain and silk which continue to capture the imagination of the affluent. Curiously, it has been observed that even newly discovered antique silks sell at almost twice the price of the newly made ones, testifying once again to the power of the 'Other' and conjuring up fantasies of the bygone Orient. Although porcelain has lost some of its appeal, "there is something in its glossy finish or elegant forms, that still has the power to arouse emotions" and still appeals especially to the well-heeled.  This traditional fascination of what the Orient has to offer the West extended to China during the seventeenth and eighteenth century as well, with a particular focus on the luxury goods that were in such high demand. These luxury goods attracted the attention of the Europeans, who sought them out not just for their beauty and practicality, but also for the non-material associations and social status that were conferred to them. The East India Companies manipulated the already existing fascination for the Orient into an obsession with Chinoiserie, a Western romanticised version of the East, by successfully capitalising on the exotic appeal of these goods and marketing them as semi-luxuries. Finally, these luxury goods were particularly captivating because they awakened the imagination of the Occident, allowing them to become acquainted with and appropriate concepts that were alien and unattainable to them, while having the power to evoke emotions that transcended time and culture.
