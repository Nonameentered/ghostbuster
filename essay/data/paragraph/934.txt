Given that the data obtained is inter-correlated, it was decided, in order to test for the extent to which scores on the sub-scales of the Ways of Coping Questionnaire are, as predicted, associated with scores on the AUDIT, that a Pearson correlation co-efficient test should be carried out. This measure is used to evaluate the strength of the linear correlation between two continuous variables; it produces a numerical co-efficient of correlation which ranges from +1 (indicating a perfect positive correlation) to -1 (indicating a perfect negative correlation), with values close to 0 indicating only a weak correlation between the two variables. The results of the Pearson correlation co-efficient test are shown in both Table 2 (above), and in the scattergraphs presented below. As can be seen from Table 2, several correlations are significant, most falling somewhere between ±0.2 and ±0.3. In all cases these correlations are quite weak on a scale of ±1.0, providing evidence that the level to which emotions-focused and problem-focused coping strategies are used by an individual is largely independent of the level to which the other strategies are used. Furthermore, the fact that all of the inter-correlations fall somewhere in the lower half of the ±1.0 range illustrates that there is only a weak association between the various strategies used.
