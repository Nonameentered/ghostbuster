Up till now, the writer has focused on the debates surrounding the nature of Winstanley's religious outlook as a means of conveying the difficulty in assuming a singular stance, and the avoidance of a direct answer to the question so far is an admittance of Winstanley's complexity as a religious thinker. Not forgetting what has been mentioned earlier, there is however, more to be said about Winstanley's views on the institutionalised church, that do not take the form of the above. The lack of attention and controversy concerning Winstanley's anticlericalism (arising from his perceived hypocrisy of the clergy and their monopoly over the interpretation of Scripture, both of which result in the oppression of the people), his suspicion towards institutionalised Christianity, and preference for the personal religious experience, is probably due to the fact that these do not define Winstanley's uniqueness as a religious thinker, but were prevalent in other radical sects. His ambivalence towards an afterlife, belief in the perfectability of man on earth, notion of true worship manifesting itself in love, and the avowed tactic of non-violence echoes that of the Ranters, though the form that it took was different.

Hence it is the communism that is embedded in Winstanley's religious outlook that stimulates the reading of Thus, Therefore, as mentioned earlier, the different interpretations of the nature of Winstanley's religious outlook reflects the agenda of each historian in trying to conceive of a holistic entity that is Winstanley.
