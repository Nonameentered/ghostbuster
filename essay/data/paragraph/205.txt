It is hard to place Stalin's policy in an unmitigated Marxist light. Despite its rhetoric, the Soviet Union of Stalin appeared to many something other than socialism. The state did not wither away, instead, a status quo of power was developing; one in which all lines came together in Moscow. An elite of scientifically based professional revolutionaries would 'show the way, formulating the program and policies, educating the people, and working out the strategy and tactics'. Stalin's biographer, Deutscher, wrote: 'It has assumed office as a government of the people, by the people and for the people [...][now,] it ceases to be government by the people'. Moreover, they revealed a highly undemocratic and unrepresentative government that stood separate from the masses.
