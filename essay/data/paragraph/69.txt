Men, especially the unskilled, are another group at risk from unemployment, and who suffered during the mass unemployment of the 1980s and 1990s. Unemployment for men over 25 has increased four fold since the 1970s (Faggio and Nickell, 2003, p 31), with 2.3 million fewer men in work now than twenty years ago (Jones and Novak, 1999, p40).
