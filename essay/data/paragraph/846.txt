The theory of trichromacy is often referred to as the Young-Helmholtz hypothesis. This assumes that colour vision is subsumed by three photosensitive pigments in the retina (Ingler, 1968), where short wavelength specific cones have a peak absorption maxima of 419nm, medium wavelength specific cones of 531nm and long wavelength specific cones of 558nm (Bruce, Green and Georgeson, 2004). Colour vision is inherited genetically with short wavelength specific genes being transmitted on chromosome number seven, and medium and long wavelength specific genes being transmitted on the x chromosome (Bowmaker, 1998). Medium and long wavelength specific genes are highly homologous and it is polymorphism of these which cause variation in colour vision. Winderickx et al (1992) found that a common polymorphism occurs at point 180 on the red opsin, and that this results in the general population having two different types of red opsin, one being alanine, and one being serine. Serine has a peak absorption maxima of 557nm and alanine has a peak absorption maxima of 552nm (Winderickx et al, 1992). This means that if alanine is substituted for serine at point 180 on the red opsin of the long wavelength specific cone, it's peak sensitivity will fall below that expected for a long wavelength sensitive photopsin and the carrier will have a reduced sensitivity to red light (Bowmaker, 1998).
