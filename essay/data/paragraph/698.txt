As the findings here are in line with the hypotheses made and in accordance with previous research and theory in the field, it can be concluded that results of this study are both reliable and valid , with generalisability of findings should further research be conducted along these lines. It is strongly suggested that research in the area be continued, as there are many areas of attention and cognitive skills yet to be looked at in conjunction with road traffic awareness. The links are important to future training in road safety with children, and a thorough understanding of the cognitive and motor skills involved in road crossing will improve our ability to teach children affective road skills. Whilst this study does not in any way prove links between attention and traffic skills, it is still useful in addressing possible areas for further research and understanding children's attention levels. Results from this experiment could lead to better training for children and the possible implementation of video or computer games involving abstract tasks to train attention skills. These results also bring to light the vulnerability of younger children and of boys compared to girls. For both parents and those working with children, boys should be made especially aware of the importance of concentration at the roadside and of possible dangers. For younger primary age children, supervision should be stressed when near roads, and roads surrounding schools should be adapted to younger pedestrians, perhaps with warning signs, speed limits and pavement barriers.
