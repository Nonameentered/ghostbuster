In order to upgrade the penstock to 6-inch all the way, a few decisions need to be made. Firstly, what kind of pipe would be used to replace the current penstock? Pipes with an outside diameter which matches the current pipe (¾” pipe wall) could be used, such as polyethylene medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) pipe, or alternatively 4” schedule 40 PVC pipe. Both pipe types are suitable for the job, as MDPE commonly has a stated working pressure of 10 bar, far exceeding the maximum working pressure of the pipe in this situation, (2.8 bar) and PVC pipe generally has a pressure rating of up to 2.5 bar. There are advantages and disadvantages for both these pipes, MDPE is more expensive, but easier to direct over long distances, while PVC is cheaper but needs to be direct in shorter runs, and bends need to compensated for. Both pipes are easy to join, however PVC needs glues and primer, while MDPE only needs pushing together. The reference data for these pipes can be found in Appendix 2 and 3.  Lastly, another decision is which route to travel from the damn upstream to the turbine house, and where to put in the new pipe. There is already a mostly manageable looking route for the pipe, downstream of some of the steeper sections of terrain through a couple of tunnels and over boulder fields. Re-routing this would involve extra work, and specialised equipment which is not only expensive but may not be able to fit in some sections.
