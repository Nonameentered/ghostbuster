The mood-state-dependent memory hypothesis by Bower (1981) provides further support for the notion that emotion has an effect on memory. This hypothesis suggests that both our moods and our memories are closely connected, so that the emotional context in which we experience and store information can affect our memory for it. Baddeley (1997) explains that this hypothesis implies two distinct effects; firstly this effect that a subject's current mood may have on his/her retrieval of information; memories recalled will be congruent with the individual's current mood, for example pleasant memories when the subject is in a good mood and unpleasant memories when the person is in a bad mood - this is known as mood congruent retrieval; as well as the effect mood has on learning and subsequent memory; the mood of the individual may affect the strength of memory for an event - this is known as mood-state-dependent learning (Eysenck & Keane, 2000).
