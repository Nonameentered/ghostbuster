The objectives of the experiment set have been achieved. The aims of the experiment are to determine the HA (haemagglutinin) titre of a virus stock, to identify that virus on the basis of reactivity with known antisera and to determine the HI (Haemagglutination inhibition) titre of the specifically reactive serum by the combination of the HA and HI assays.
