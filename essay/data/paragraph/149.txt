In a combination of open diplomatic dialogue, pressure, and unrestricted support, the Soviet Union's actions were instrumental in the transformation of the southeastern European countries eastern zone countries of Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Czechoslovakia. In 1945 and 1946 Stalin justified the resulting pro-communist governments of Eastern Europe as natural consequents of liberations, revolutions, and democratic elections. Miko Concurrently, just as the Soviet Union did not openly interfere in its neighbour nations internal affairs, the western powers followed a negligent diplomatic policy towards the area. By not daring to take any decisive actions, they allowed the Soviets to keep on acting uniformly with their 'real politics' in Eastern Europe. Although the United States 'had some knowledge of what was going on, it was not prepared to become involved'. The west's tendency to provide the eastern countries with ties of diplomatic recognition, without proper monitoring of the liberating countries' internal affairs and mentioning of the expulsion of non-communist opposition, was certainly a mistake. Especially, when considering 'the world was still in the dark as to the relationship of the Lublin Poles to their traditional government in exile' In addition, the institutional support of Stalin during the Potsdam Conference of July 1945, which showed no firm attitude towards the complete Soviet control of Eastern Europe, was interpreted as tacit agreement.
