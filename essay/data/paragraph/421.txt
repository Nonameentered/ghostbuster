Chloroplasts and mitochondria have their own ribosomes which are highly similar in size to, and in some cases, even smaller than the prokaryotic ribosomes. However, their ribosomes are distinct from the ribosomes present in the cytosol of eukaryotes. Ribosomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts differ from other cellular ribosomes due to their ability to produce proteins using their own proteins and unpolarly transferred tRNA molecules Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of mitochondria and chloroplasts are more closely related to the bacterial rRNA in sequence and contains some sequences similar to Archaea rRNA These features strongly suggest that mitochondria and chloroplasts have descended from free-living bacteria and archaea, which have been endocytosed by a eukaryotic host cell Mitochondrial and chloroplast ribosomes are sensitive to antibiotics, which inhibit bacterial ribosomes; for example, linear erythromycin interferes with ribosomal protein translation, but not in the cytosolic systems
