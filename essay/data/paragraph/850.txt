Winderickx et al (1992) and Cohn et al (1989) both show that it is possible for a woman to be a tetrachromat. An important distinction has to be made however between being a tetrachromat and having tetrachromatic vision. The requirement for tetrachromatic vision is not as simple as having four different wavelength specific cones. The brain has to be plastic enough to adapt to the extra cones and create post receptoral neural channels to process the information and interpret it(Jordan and Mollen, 1993). Simply having four wavelength specific cones available is known as weak tetrachromacy, but being able to use them is strong tetrachromacy (Jordan and Mollen, 1993). This however is very difficult to test whilst the person is alive, and behavioural tests do not appear to be sensitive enough to accurately discriminate between tetrachromatic vision and trichromatic vision (Jameson et al, 2001).A problem regarding the sensitivity of behavioural tests is that the shifted fourth cones are possibly too close to original trichromatic cones to be able to accurately distinguish between them. There is only a maximum of a six nanometre difference between alanine an serine, and whereas this may be enough to produce a more detailed, complex vision of the world in females who are tetrachromatic, it may be that it is not enough to always be detected in contrived, laboratory, behavioural tests. There is some evidence however that heterozygous females may not only be tetrachromats, but have tetrachromatic vision (Jameson et al, 2001). The fact that Cohn et al (1989) found that there are normal and defective cells operating in the retina implies that the fourth, shifted opsin is operating and that the brain has adapted to receive the input because if it had not, Cohn et al (1989) would not have found defective patches on the retina. This strongly suggests that as well as having four different cones responding to different wavelengths of light, they are also all being utilised.
