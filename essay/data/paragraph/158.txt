Factors that had been present for centuries in the life of medieval people, such as the intellectual and religious efflorescence that had developed in late medieval religious orders, as well as the generalised feeling of unrest among the masses due to high taxes and religious corruption, helped in the transformation of the Europe of the middle ages into the Europe of modernity during the Reformation.  The appearance of the humanist movement in northern Europe, more than a century before the Reformation, was one of the most important factors influencing the course of history. Humanists brought with them a new language for discussing theological issues, introducing the concept of a 'pure religion', as well as the tools for critically studying religious texts. Italian humanists brought techniques of philology to Germany, and the desire to reform the Latin language. Such linguistic reform, and the humanists' urge to rediscover and immerse themselves in ancient texts and, more generally, in the power of the human mind, challenged man's attitude toward theological matters. Alongside the intellectual reforms, humanism also stirred a spirit of national identity, that is, of a distinct German identity, as humanists praised Germany's pious and learned traditions.
