The Black Death of 1347 to 1352 and the subsequent outbreaks of the plague were 'the most devastating natural disasters ever to strike Europe' Although it is impossible to calculate the exact death toll of the Black Death, as there is limited evidence, 'to maintain that one European in three died... cannot be wildly far from the truth' As there were a number of social, economic and political changes that occurred around that time, the Black Death can be viewed as a turning point in the history of Europe; F. A. Gasquet believed it to have formed 'the real close of the Medieval period and the beginning of our Modern age' On the other hand, there are worries that too great a significance has been placed on the impact of the Black Death. Philip Ziegler, for example, argues that 'in the long run things would have followed the same course, even though there had never been a plague'
