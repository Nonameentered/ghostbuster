Thesis Statement This dissertation will argue that the development of critical realism by Roy Bhaskar is a positive development for sociology by effectively critiquing empiricism, thereby providing an approach that can be used to highlight the deficiencies associated with the traditional ontologies available in sociology. It will be shown how Margaret Archer launched an immanent critique of the said sociological ontologies by utilising the realist ontology, and has constructed a worthwhile methodological complement to the realist ontology. The dissertation will also seek to show that there is no logical contradiction at the core of realism, and that adoption of the realist ontology does not involve sociologists sacrificing their critical character as there will be disagreement over the 'essentially contested' nature of our familiar concepts. Ultimately, this dissertation will advance the view that the ascendancy of realism within sociology would provide us with a strong foundation from which to develop a body of theories and a collection of empirical evidence that can make a worthwhile contribution to the development of society.
