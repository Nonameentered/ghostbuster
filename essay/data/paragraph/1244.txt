Studies into attention have found that attention could also be a processing resource, as it may serve as a source for other cognitive operations (Salthouse, 1991). Therefore the age-differences we see in experiments may in simply be attributable to a general reduction in attention (Hasher & Zacks, 1988; Plude & Hoyer, 1985). However, there seems to be a difference in opinion as to how we should measure and differentiate attentional processes. Plude and Hoyer (1985) assert that "...measuring attention consists of evaluating the selectivity of information processing" (p.52). However, the majority of research states that the focus should be on divided attention (Burke and Light, 1981, as cited in Salthouse, 1991). This is also reflective of a common flaw in the design of attention studies; namely their need to isolate different attentional processes. This appears to be counterproductive if attention is a processing resource, as it is difficult to entirely separate attention from other cognitive activities (Madden & Whitling, 2004).
