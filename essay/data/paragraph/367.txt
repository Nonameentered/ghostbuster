At the time of the film's release, the Alert America campaign ran within the context of Cold War culture. From Dick's initial 'stand by for a visual display bound to send a thrill up all backbones' to the patriotic beach holidays, the film offers a resounding call to patriotic duty. Citing 'battleships and B-52s', the state's military and technological prowess is aggrandized and indeed, it is the military's stubborn and blinkered insistence on superiority that leads to Ripper's attack on the Soviet Union. Despite this, Austin asserts it is 'not a war movie' as There is no doubt that the President's plan to freeze all military action until the 'Russians can be contacted and absolutely certain that this is not just a bluff' is a patently unworkable solution. He suggests pursuing a course of moral negotiations with the Soviet powers. Austin thus argues that the Cold War could be won through strategies of peace and negotiation, rather than adherence to a policy, which propagated progressive destruction. Even the ultimate destruction of the Soviet coal mine is but another display of Cold War hubris and technological superiority.
