London was growing rapidly during the Tudor and Stuart period. As the population of the country as a whole doubled, the population of London quadrupled. In 1500 the population was just 50,000, but this had risen to 490,000 by 1700. There was a low fertility rate as only a small proportion of people were married and the poor living conditions in the capital resulted in a high mortality rate; yet the population continued to rise. The explanation for this comes from the high level of migration into the city. In order to counter the effects of low fertility and high mortality rates on the population, London needed around 7,000 migrants entering the city every year to grow at the rate it did. E.A Wrigley estimated that one in six people had lived in London at some stage in their life by the end of the seventeenth century A. L. Beier and R. Finlay have raised the question of why it was London that attracted so many people. There were between 700 and 800 market towns in England, including a dozen major provincial cities, so 'the country was not devoid of possible competitors to London' The motivations for migration into the capital are numerous. Some people's reasons to move to London were to get away from the countryside and smaller towns (push factors) and others were motivated by what the city had to offer (pull factors).
