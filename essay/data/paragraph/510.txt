The graph shows that the absorbance of casein is at its greatest at pH 5.04. As this is the pH at which the highest absorbance occurs, it must equate to the isoelectric point for casein i.e. the pH at which the overall charge of the casein molecule is neutral. As this point correlates to the pH at which the majority of the molecule had precipitated, it also shows that at this point the protein has the greatest degree of precipitation.
