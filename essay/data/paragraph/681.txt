Many studies have tested the effect of different types of speech on recall, but most focus on the effect of phonologically similar or dissimilar words on the number of items recalled, (Boyle, 1996). Results suggest that interference from background speech which is similar sounding disrupts working memory more than dissimilar sounding words.
