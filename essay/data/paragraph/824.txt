The use of questionnaires did also prove a problem as response bias may have occurred. It is likely that participants gave socially desirable answers in order to appear normal and to avoid prejudice. This type of bias may have prevented some participants from giving their true opinions or behaviours making the results less generalisable. Another limitation of this study was the restriction of university chosen. Although the Italia Conti Academy is a respected institution, it may be advantaged as it is a performing arts academy. The type of students it attracts may be very different to students of a non performing arts undergraduate. It may clearly affect the overall results of the experiment.
