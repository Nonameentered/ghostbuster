A crucial part of one's religious outlook is constituted by how one understands the nature of God, and as with most other things about Winstanley, this is controversial, and is centred on two main positions-God is immanent as opposed to God being immanent and transcendent. The adherents of the former include Zagorin This view of Winstanley's "God", is most agreeable to their take on Winstanley as a whole, and disposes of the potential problem that the belief in a transcendental God might pose to their reading of Winstanley. Whereas those who take the line that Winstanley was influenced by theology throughout his writing career, assert his belief in an immanent and transcendental God. While both positions can be substantiated by a reading of Although the idea that God is immanent is littered throughout the text It seems to me that if Winstanley believes in a Creator God It not only seems absurd to think that God must be bound by an either/or straitjacket, but it is also simplistic to think in such strict dichotomy.
