Generally, the semiconductor strain gauges were made from silicon and they had a much higher gauge factors than the metal ones which made them much more sensitive than the metal ones (Gauge factors were between 100 - 175 or -100 to -140 depending on whether the silicon was doped with 'P' or 'N' type material, compared with gauge factors of 2 for the metal ones), but it didn't mean that they were automatically better than the metal ones though. The strain gauges based on semiconductor materials were rather more expensive, more difficult to apply and had greater sensitivity to temperature changes than the metal ones. The greater sensitivity to temperature changes meant that the relative change in resistance is now non-linear and therefore more complicated.
