It has long been recognised that emotions exert powerful effects on memory, and that what we feel can strongly influence what we remember. The types of effects that emotion can have on memory differ markedly, depending on the precise conditions of encoding and retrieval (Eich, Kihlstrom, Bower, Forgas & Miedenthal, 2000). Differences in emphasis during encoding, for example, can have a profound effect on how, or indeed whether, information is remembered later (Gleitman, 1999) and similarly, the emotional state of a person at the time of retrieval may influence what they remember. Two central questions have arisen out of the study of the impact of emotion on memory; firstly, whether emotion increases or decreases the strength of memory for an event, and secondly, whether special mechanisms are required to account for the effects of emotion on memory (Eich et al, 2000). This essay will examine ways in which people's memories are affected by their feelings, and will also investigate models put forward as explanations as to why emotion has such an influence on memory.
