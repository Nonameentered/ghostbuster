The most extensive population study of the early modern period was carried out by E.A. Wrigley and R.S. Schofield, In very general terms these criticisms focus upon the following main areas. The sample of four hundred and four parish registers used to estimate national population figures makes up only four percent of the total number of parishes in early modern England. In addition, the sample includes too many large parishes (usually Northern areas) and too few smaller parishes (usually Eastern areas). London is also underrepresented in the study due to its lack of surviving parish registers. Even good registers however were inaccurate for certain periods (such as during the civil war) and thus only for the year 1662 were all the registers fit to use.
