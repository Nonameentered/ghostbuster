Korsakoff's syndrome occurs due to neuronal loss in the mamillary bodies and is associated with cell shrinkage in a particular nucleus of the thalamus and the mamillary bodies. Mairal. (1979) examined 2 Korskoff patients and found that both brains showed shrunken, diseased mamillary bodies. It is distinguished by confusion and a deficit in storing new information (anterograde amnesia). This type of amnesia is usually caused by chronic alcoholism. The alcohol prevents the liver from metabolising the vitamin thiamine, which causes a thiamine deficiency, which in turn leads to the breakdown and loss of neurons, and because neurons are not replaced the damage is irreversible. Therefore Korsakoff's involves a progressive degeneration of brain tissue (Principles Of Biopsychology, 2001, p.88).
