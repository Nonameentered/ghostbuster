The darker, more precarious side of social interaction lies in the tensions of power underneath its surface. Ethnomethodology does not deny the existence of a "common culture", and this would be an absurd claim to make (Alexander 1987: 262); however, the precariousness of social interaction is exactly that what this "common culture" is not: individuals may challenge the existing order by either directly confronting it, or, more subtly, by manipulating its general traits to their advantage. Whether this challenge is pursued consciously or not is, strictly spoken, not relevant; as Pitkin asserts, 'One may have to intend to lie in order to lie, but one need not intend to deceive in order to deceive' (Pitkin in Coulter 1979: 12). An analogy may here be found in the functioning of penal codes, in that 'the fit is 'managed' through negotiating socially organized activities' (Cicourel 1973: 13) in which both hidden and open methods of manipulation are used.
