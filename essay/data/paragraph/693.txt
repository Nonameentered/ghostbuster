Method  The study population consisted of 91 primary school children who were randomly sampled from 5 primary schools in southern England, respectively aged 4-5 (n=30), 6-7 (n=31) and 8-9 (n=30). The children were both male (n=53) and female (n=38) and were all within the normal intelligence range (IQ>80). To access attention levels, the Test of Everyday Attention for Children was used (Robertson, Ward, Ridgeway & Nimmo-Smith, 1996). The Task includes three audiovisual games, in which children must respond to the opposite of what is shown on the screen. Two versions of the task were used, with and without a distracting cartoon. Each game lasted 3 minutes for each condition and the order of conditions was counterbalanced. To ensure counterbalancing, a block design was adopted, whereby half the sample did the distraction condition first and the other half completed the no distraction condition first. A computerised response time recorder was employed to record all response times. After an initial practice game, each child completed two separate rounds of the game, one with a distraction (cartoon) and one without a distraction (quiet room), with the room setup remaining fixed for both conditions to avoid environmental or task novelty effects.
