In conclusion there could be many factors effecting whether a child turns out to be popular or unpopular. The majority however seem to ignore the child's actual personality which probably plays a large role. There is little doubt however that factors such as attachment type and early experiences with reciprocal friendships are valuable in learning the necessary skills to socialise and which therefore give you an increased chance of being popular and having friends. It has been shown that lack of friends or being unpopular may lead to problems with psychological development and these seem to be more extreme with rejected rather than neglected children. There is plenty still to discover however regarding whether being unpopular causes psychological problems, or the psychological problems are already there and cause unpopularity. It would appear from the conclusions made in this essay that it is a likely combination of the two.
