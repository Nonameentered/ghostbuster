The WSPU also adopted tactics of destruction of property, which included bombing campaigns, arson and post office raids (Lawrence et al 2000). The bombs were meant to draw attention to their cause, rather than to cause actual destruction; most of the bombs were basic detonators with no explosives in them. Nevertheless, they were still seen as a danger, and were condemned as terrorist activities (Pugh 2000). Many of the campaigners were arrested for these activities, and some of them were even imprisoned for a number of years (Harrison 1978). The press and the public responded with mixed feelings; condemnation of the WSPU was mixed with general respect for their fighting spirit (Lawrence et al 2000).
