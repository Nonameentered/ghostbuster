The conjugation mix was incubated in a static water bath so that the mating pair will not be disrupted. The mating pairs are very fragile and easily broken apart. Nalidixic acid was included in all the selective plates to select against the donor strain and it also prevents further gene transfer from the donor to the recipient. Only the recombinant strain is resistant to nalidixic acid. If nalidixic acid was not included, the donor strain will also grow on the plates, thus the time for gene transfer cannot be deduced, as all the plates will show the donor phenotypes. Both the donor and the recipient strains were plated on the selective media to control for the presence of revertents, as point mutations can revert unlike deletions. Even though this interrupted mating technique is important for rough mapping, fine structure mapping of genes which are close together (such as leucine and proline) cannot be determined as the time difference for the transfer of those genes is very small.
