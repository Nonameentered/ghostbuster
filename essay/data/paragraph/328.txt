To conclude, despite a climate in which the old metanarratives are seen as intellectually bankrupt and it is claimed that social identities are created by discourse, class remains of fundamental importance. Underpinning the debates is a constant and perhaps non-solvable epistemological problem - what is class? Much of the critique proclaiming the 'death of class' has only focused on its more Marxist reductive definitions and inability to look beyond the economic world. Although, no longer holding the master key to unlocking the entire historical process as seasoned Marxists would assert, class retains an analytical purchase in examining social structures, hierarchies and collective groupings, particularly when used in conjunction with race and gender, in an inter-linked 'Holy Trinity'. Furthermore, class is not just an esoteric occupation, consumed in the world of theory, but has a reality on the streets of modern Britain. To believe that class is not 'real' is only a prerogative of those unaffected by its inherent exclusions and prejudices.
