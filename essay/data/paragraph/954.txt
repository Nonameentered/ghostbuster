What is a psychological disorder? A psychological disorder can be defined as a dysfunction within an individual that is associated with distress or impairment in functioning and a response that is not typical. The behaviourist approach in psychology understands human behaviour as a consequence of conditioning. This approach claims that all human behaviour is shaped by reinforcement from the environment and the consequences of actions. Humans become conditioned to respond to our environment as a result of leaning by association or operant. Learning by association or classical conditioning is attributed to Ivan Pavlov and his theory of classical conditioning, while operant conditioning, or learning by way of reward and unpleasant consequence, is credited to BF Skinner. Operant conditioning states that all behaviour is a result of learning, of positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement and punishment. (Skinner, B. F., 1974) Perhaps a person has been rewarded for doing exhibiting certain behaviour in the past and these acts as positive reinforcement and helps sustain the behaviour. Similarly, a person may have been told off for exhibiting a certain type of bad behaviour and these acts as punishment and a deterrent of such future behaviour. Classical conditioning is "a form of learning in which a hitherto neutral stimulus, the conditioned stimulus is paired with an unconditioned stimulus regardless of what the animal does."
