During the second world war, Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt had held much promise for the freedom and liberty of the post-war era. At the Tehran conference in 1943, the 'Big Three' agreed that 'the interests of the liberated peoples must have equal weight with the legitimate interests of the former rulers' and that 'governmental authorities broadly representative of all democratic elements in the population and of other segments in the population must be established'. The intentions behind these 'Democratisation Agreements' were however soon violated. The disputes which ensued between the 'Big Three' at Yalta already revealed a certain change in the Soviet policy: instead of opposing a coalition government of representatives from all legitimate parties in Poland, Stalin began to favour the Lublin committee, the 'self-constituted government of the country', and to argue, in agreement with Roosevelt, that the legislative assembly should consist of 'non-partisan personalities', which he interpreted to mean communist or pro-Soviet parties. Briefly put, he advocated the domination of communists in the post-war interim administration in that country.
