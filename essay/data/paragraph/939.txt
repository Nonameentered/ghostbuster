Philip G. Zimbardo. Stanley Milgram. Their names are synonymous with any form of psychological research. Their work rages with controversy as with their theories that still spark incessant debates. Both are eminent psychologist that studied aspects of human behaviour concerned with obedience to an authoritative figure. Both psychologists studied this phenomenon differently using different methods. Zimbardo created a make-shift prison and Milgram created an electric shock experiment, to ultimately deduce the same conclusion.
