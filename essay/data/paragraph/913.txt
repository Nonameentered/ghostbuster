A further problem Blackmore tackles is that of altruism, which conflicts with traditional understanding that humans selfishly pursue their own interests. Traditionally altruism has been explained either in terms of advantage to the genes; you are altruistic towards your children because they are the only direct way your genes can be carried on into future generations; you are altruistic toward fellow men because you may get aid in return, or in terms of a true morality, an independent moral conscience or a spiritual essence in humans that overcomes the selfish dictates of our genes; a view which finds little favour with scientists (Blackmore, 1999). Memetics provides a third solution. Blackmore suggests that the kind, generous, altruistic person will spread more memes. He will have more friends and spend more time talking to them; they will be influenced by him and in turn will imitate his popular behaviour. Thus his altruism will spread. In contrast, the mean and selfish person will have few chances to replicate his memes because the few people who could potentially imitate him rarely do so.
