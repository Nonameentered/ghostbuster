This production of a compliant and obedient female model of behaviour reflected the nationalist Japanese sentiment at the time for increased strength as a nation. Changes in governmental ideology were taking place in order for Japan to compete with the West as a powerful imperial nation and political programme of 'women's civilisation' emerged. It was declared via various governmental documents and speeches that the civilising of women was necessary in order for Japan to be seen as a civilised nation itself, in line with notions of Westernisation and imperialism. Social and domestic life was thus publicised as the woman's domain whereas the public domain of politics and industrialisation was given over to men. This reinforced the Confucian and the accepted notions of woman's role; though the woman was no longer expected to be solely domestic, she was not to be involved in any political decisions.
