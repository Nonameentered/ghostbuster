Zimbardo's experiment commenced on a quiet Sunday morning in August. 24 males were used as subjects and they were randomly allocated to either "guard" or "prisoner". They were then to assume the roles as they best see fit. Prisoners had to wear a smock with no underwear, rubber sandals, stockings on their heads and a heavy chain on their right foot. Guards wore a khaki uniform, reflective sunglasses, a whistle around their necks and they carried a billy club. The subjects were placed in a make-shift prison. Prisoners were never called by name and were only identified by number. All these were to cause deindividuation of both prisoners and guards. Cameras and intercom systems were set up so as to be able to observe and record all the happenings.
