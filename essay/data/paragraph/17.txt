Human judgement is a key factor in this criticism, but as the decision process shows it is not just the judgement of those composing the statistics that is involved (Hindess, 1973). This means that as the process continues the statistics become further distorted as different people's views and decisions become involved. This idea can be illustrated using the example of suicide. The official statistics produced on this topic are not only influenced by those collating the statistics, but also by those determining the causes of death. This can be seen by the fact that in the past Catholic priests did not like to categorise the cause of a death as 'suicide', so the term 'natural cause' would have been used instead, resulting in a very different set of statistics in the end. Cicourel also supports this idea; however he takes it one step further by saying that these decisions are influenced by people's background experiences (Cicourel, cited in Hindess, 1973). This means that even if two people from the same organisation tried to collect the same results there would be complications as they have had different experiences.
