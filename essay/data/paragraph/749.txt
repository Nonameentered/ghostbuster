There were a number of social changes that arose from the Black Death. The plague 'must have killed in some areas almost everyone' Inevitably, this led to disruption of families, especially in the towns where extended families often lived together. This had an effect on the social structure of the family; the vital family continuity was destroyed as people moved into their positions of power without the support of a family or mentors who had risen before them. As a result, there was a breakdown in traditional values and morality. This created a shock; one of the basic safety nets of society had been taken away. People were understandably fearful of death and these feelings were reflected in the religious popular works such as Piers Plowman. They were no longer comforted by the thought of redemption of mankind, but instead worried about their own mortality. This meant that people became increasingly self-centred; their thoughts were focused on themselves and nobody else. As Ziegler remarks, 'man became his own salvation' People focused on other, more attainable goals such as money, pleasure and individual advancement. The greatest impact of the Black Death may have been its ' profound psychological effects' on the people.
