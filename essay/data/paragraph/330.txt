The intention of this paper is move outward from new and old statistical empirical evidence, found on the one hand in the National Archives (PRO) and the RAF Museum Archive, and on the other, in existing secondary literature, and ask what this reveals about British air strategy in the 1920s and 1930s. The methodology used is to take researched evidence, portray it in the form of charts, data bases or spreadsheets, and then use this IT generated information as the foundation for discussion. The archive material was not examined with any pre-conceived conclusions in mind. It will be our job to use all the empirical meat to create an interpretable abstract of air strategy. We will question whether these sources either perpetuate or shed new light on existing discourse. Along the road the sources will be challenged for their usefulness as historical pieces of evidence.
