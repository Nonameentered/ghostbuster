One possible difficulty with Wieder's description of the convict code serving as a kind of supra-personal "accounting" schema is that it implies a degree of homogeneity which does not always befit the dynamic nature of "real-life" social behaviour. Wieder himself admits that '[e]vidence of the fragility of [the convict code's] veneer was seen in the uncertainty that attended any serious breach of its "taboos"' (Wieder 1974: 151). The staff's handling of such violations borders the precipitous and often provides a heart-rending insight into the "precariousness of human interaction" (Cicourel 1973: 105). In such cases, staff had to confront residents with a reflexive questioning of the very meaning of 'the code's' principles. Framing social interactions around a concept of 'the code' provided enough valid reason to either interact with the residents, or to sharply react.
