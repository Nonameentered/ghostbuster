Overall this shows that there are many complex influences upon the decision of whether or not have children. In the decision to have children discourses on motherhood and reproduction create the ideal that motherhood is both natural and fulfilling for women, and this impacts upon personal, economic and social factors, including security, happiness and social capital, that lead to women choosing to have children. The same idea can be seen in the decision not to have children, as changing opportunities for women, and emerging discourses are making it possible for women to decide that for personal, economic and social reasons, for example lifestyle choices, they wish to remain childless.
