However, a basic view of economic determinism has to be accepted - it was evident that colonisation was brought about through a desire to gain new markets and increase economic wealth. In the light of Britain's dominance in the Indian subcontinent, the concept of 'informal empire' was created, where the effective rule was in the hands of private investors and entrepreneurs (chartered companies, such as the East India Company). The concept of 'informal empire' has been criticised, and some have argued that '...the conventional distinction between informal and formal imperial dominion is artificial and misleading..." If this is the case, then the issue of economic benefits needs to be looked at more closely. The alleged benefits of imperialism were manifold, ranging from new markets, increased production and a steady supply of raw materials.
