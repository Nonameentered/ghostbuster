These global changes were also further compounded by increases in technology, and government policies. Technology displaced or made more flexible many jobs in the parts of the manufacturing industry that survived (Burnett, 1994) and meant that fewer workers were needed in the growing service sector. It also meant that many unskilled and semi skilled jobs disappeared from the market, as technology could now be used (Mizen, 2003). Ashton and Maguire argue that government policy made this problem worse however, as it weakened trade union power and made these changes easier for employers to introduce (1991), and Professor Laynard agrees, claiming that rising inflation, fiscal monetary policies and a lack of commitment to full employment caused dramatic increases in unemployment (Laynard, cited in Burnett, 1994, p268).
