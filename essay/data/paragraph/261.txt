The WSPU had become significantly more radical in its tactics, evidenced by the slogan 'vote or freedom' adopted in 1905 (Banks 1981). This implied that the suffragettes claimed physical autonomy, equated with a right to choose how to use their bodies in public and in relation to men. Whenever attacked verbally or physically, as was often the case, suffragettes felt justified in retaliating with similar action. The refusal to be passive, long considered as being a virtue of British femininity (Holton 1998), any more received physical expression (Harrison 1978). This included a campaign to publicly shame cabinet ministers who were against the enfranchisement of women, by marching on their houses and gathering stones outside while singing the 'Red Flag' (Harrison 1978). To a certain extent, this equates to a process of legitimising political behaviour, preceding passive resistance movements in the twentieth century, such as those of Mahatma Gandhi in India
