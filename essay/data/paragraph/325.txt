We must now discuss the impact of race and gender on class. The new social movements have argued that the class preoccupation with the realm of production, held up as its mark of theoretical rigour, downplays the salience of race and gender as categories of historical analysis. Where Marx would argue that ethnic groups are no more than 'national left overs' Voices emanating from women's history, for example, claim that few women appear in the canonical texts of class and therefore this argues that class analysis should be abandoned, because it takes into account only half of possible historical actors. Although sympathetic to this debate, it is wrong to reject class unconditionally. Instead of bifurcating class, race and gender, historians need to recognise that they are integrated at a conceptual level. Certainly, industrial reconstructing of class relations in Britain resonated in the social and racial engineering of empire. The British exported the vocabulary of class to describe Africans as the same as the lower classes in Britain - 'the residuum'. Race is thus also about class. Furthermore, recent gender studies Class for many working class women has become a ' hidden injury of class' Ergo, they do not speak of class in the traditional sense - 'I am working class'. Class is thus not just about representation, 'a subject position which can be taken off a discursive shelf and worn at will' Gender is thus also about class. So where does this leave us? Arguably, we should take the Weberian line. Class is neither the sole nor historically universal principle of social structure. Class is best seen as part of a complex interplay with other aspects of social structure such as race and gender
