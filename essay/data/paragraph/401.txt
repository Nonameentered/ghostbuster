For the HA assay, the result of the HA assay is shown in table 1. The results for the HA assay was obtained by observing the agglutination of RBCs in each dilution. If the whole well was homogenously red, the agglutination of RBCs had occur and the dilution present is greater than what is needed to cause agglutination. As the dilution further decreased, the interaction between the virus and RBCs does not take place and the amount of virus was decreased. If slightly pink/salmony/cloudy suspension was observed at the bottom of the well, that means that the virus present is adequate enough to cause agglutination and that was the end point where virus concentration was adequate enough to cause the clumping of RBCs (refer to the appendix 1 for details). For the HI assay, the result of HI assay is shown in table 2. This method of haemagglutination inhibition (HI) is used to differentiate a virus from other depending on the antibody used, as some antibodies may react only to certain viruses. To determine the HI titre, the 2 antibodies which could have reacted to the unknown virus provided were used.
