Once results have led to conclusions it I important to validate these in any discussion, to improve the quality of the research. One concept is that of reflexivity, where the researcher reflects on and evaluates the method design and even personal perspective, (Merrick, 1993). This has been used in a study by Vigil, Hodges and Klee (2005) about parental language input. In the introduction and discussion the researchers examine their own theories and expectations, gender, age, culture, political beliefs and therefore possible bias. They then consider ways to counteract this and evaluate the possible input of such bias, an idea known as triangulation, (Merrick, 1993).
