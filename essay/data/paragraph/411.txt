The endosymbiotic theory of Margulis is the idea that prokaryotes, specifically bacteria, were engulfed by the ancestral eukaryotes resulting in the formation of organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. The theory also suggests that these organelles were then maintained endogenously in a mutualistic relationship with their host The theory was first postulated by Lynn Margulis in 1967 as, "organisms that evolved from different and distinct units by symbiogenesis within a larger organism and developed a permanent association." 6 This was a bold hypothesis, which was initially frowned upon by most scientists, especially when Margulis suggested that the prokaryotes were miniscule strands of DNA derived from the primitive eukaryotes' cytoplasm.  The theory states that in certain apical eukaryotes, the bacterial endosymbiont took up nutrients and provided its host with energy in the form of ATP by anaerobic respiration or photosynthesis. Furthermore, their interaction also resulted in an increased cell efficiency and complexity, leading to the emergence of novel eukaryotic cell structures such as those requiring oxygen which are not found in other organisms.
