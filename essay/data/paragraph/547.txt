In contrast to embryo stem cell research, the properties of adult stem cells have proved very difficult to define, resulting in the idea that these cells lacked properties of self-renewal and plasticity (9). Adult stem cells were thought to only be able to differentiate into limited cell types found in their tissue of origin and when stimulated to divide, only did so for a short number of times before finally producing non-replicating cells (9).
