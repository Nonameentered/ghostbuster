The adventure story of late nineteenth century England portrayed the Imperialist project as a positive enterprise driven by the Englishman's right to conquer those deemed 'uncivilised' (Showalter, 1991; 77). The morality of the Imperialist project was rarely questioned in the adventure stories. Its integration into the narrative of adventure stories gave the impression that it was an admirable undertaking, and it provided young Englishmen with a model of masculinity that was 'virile, courageous and purposeful' (77). Thus, Imperialism influenced the construction of gender identities in the late nineteenth century as it provided Englishmen with a potent ideal of 'manhood' from which to shape their character, and the notion of subjugating 'uncivilised' people which was entwined with this ideal placed upon them a sense of responsibility to uphold the English notion of propriety. The projection of the Englishman as the protector of the 'inferior' also established for him an elevated status of 'civilised'.
