To analyse naturalistic observations many researchers use the technique of videotape recording and then coding the results for analysis, as used by researchers such as Pica, (1984); and Foppa, Weiner, Mitchener-Nissen and Moore, (2003). Videotaping observations eliminates errors in recall and as each observation is recorded from the same point of view, possible bias and cultural influences can be eliminated, for example attitudes towards power, gender or race. In order to increase reliability and validity samples need to be taken from as many contexts as possible, e.g. across genders, age ranges, cultural differences, etc, (Foppa et al, 2003).
