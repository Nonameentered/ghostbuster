Proponents of the 'linguistic turn' have also taken up the cacophony of voices declaring the redundancy of class. Born in the theoretical implosions of post-structuralism, language is deemed the foundation of all human activity, exemplified in Levi Strauss's claim 'if you solve the problem...of language, we can explain the rest' Disciples of this school argue that historians cannot study the vexed relations between capital and labour because it was the language that people employed that provided the essential source of their identity. Class becomes no more than a simple rhetorical construction, still less a genuine motor of change. Gareth Steedman Jones provides the seminal work. He argued that social movements, such as Chartism, could be constituted on ideological and political planes, autonomous from Marxist economic conditions, and irrespective of class connections between them. Chartism spoke a language of class, which owed less to material underpinnings of class than it did to a vision of political evils of capitalist power, which would have predated class-consciousness. By stressing the political content of Chartism, emblematic in the language of parasitism and oppression, he forces us to consider the non-class character of popular radicalism. However, he abandons class at a considerable cost and, indeed, he concludes that his model leads to 'an unconvincing idealism' He underplays the class nature of Chartism, ignoring the class antagonism at the level of production, and views the position of the state with rose tinted glasses in which the glare of reform obscures undercurrents of coercion and economic controls. If class is to be sacrificed on the altar, it cannot be done with such an idealised reading of discourse.
