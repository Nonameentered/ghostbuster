Whilst Stalin's administrative skills and positions of power in the party were important for laying the foundations for his rise, his political skill and personality were also of paramount importance. Trotsky famously described Stalin as having 'marvellous organisational traits', and compared him to the '...grey blur of the bureaucractic machine; Stalin was working quietly, persistently, monotonously, without resting, often without sleep, always with the same routine loyalty to one cause - that of Stalin;' although this was undoubtedly a negative account of Stalin's success, the accuracy of it must be acknowledged. He knew how to carry out practical tasks, to operate bureaucratically and effectively, and seemed to have a knack of appearing even that those whose support he wanted offering very little for it; he was successful in gaining the support of the widest possible audience. His political stealth was demonstrated time and again. Edward Acton has written that; 'it was Stalin's quickness of perception, his alacrity in exploitation of passing situations, and his willingness to take risks which won the day.' He was unfussy, pragmatic, and outmanoeuvred his opponents. In short; 'Stalin was a tough, smart and thoroughly unprincipled political operative...he had no inhibitions in the brutal manoeuvres of power.' Stalin had his own idea of how to get on in the party and in the state, he knew what the direction and aim of the Bolsheviks should be, and he set about implementing it. It is clear though that his process was simultaneously subtle and brutal.
