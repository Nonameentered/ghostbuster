On the whole it is easier to note the effect of New World products on the rest of the world, but the influence of European foodstuffs on Latin America cannot be forgotten. Whilst the Columbian Exchange did not alter the staple diet of natives, auxiliary items were more readily adapted to greatly reform the meals that Indians ate; the tortilla endured, but was consumed with meat, fruits and vegetables introduced by the Old World. New items not only meant changes in variety of consumption, but the increased products reduced the chances of starvation from crop failure, and also led to better sources of nutrients- most notably protein. As Super concludes 'nutritional regimes were an expression of the changing historical reality of Latin America' As the New World was embracing the influx of foreign foodstuffs, they were also enduring the commercialisation and slavery implemented by colonisers in their attempt to exploit these newfound lands for European benefit. The Columbian Exchange not only reformed the diet of Latin America, it altered the manner in which foodstuffs were produced and in some ways led to the subordination of natives under the colonial government.
