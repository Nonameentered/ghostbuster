The results also lead to uncertainty. While this study has conformed with a number of previous social facilitation theories, it has also demonstrated results that differ to the classic drive theories outlined by Zajonc (1965). The evidence, however, lies within the results. A low p value of 0.05 is indicative of a significant result, which indicates some support for the original hypothesis. The high means of accuracy in all conditions and the non-significant relationship between speed and accuracy could still supports drive theories, as Zajonc (1965) infers that the arousal from a task is higher and faster the more people are present. Therefore, in this task, accuracy reflects this theory, as it does not suggest whether the task has been completed correctly or incorrectly. The speed in which participants complete it is what reflects the effects of social facilitation. The insignificant difference between conditions 2 and 5 does however call into question the nature of the phenomenon, and suggests that when thousands of studies support a phenomenon, there may be more to it.
