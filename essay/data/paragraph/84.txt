Ultimately, it is apparent that both perceived causes and treatments of madness differed between the working and middle classes, affecting the lives of many Victorian women, as well as re-emphasising class divisions in society. Whereas working class women may have used madness as a protest against their economical oppression, middle and upper class women were more likely to use it to protest against the social ideals forced upon them, which also permeated through to the working class as part of the Victorian Domestic Ideology. It can be concluded that madness was gendered in class specific ways, with distinctly separate discourses on the subject regarding each class.
