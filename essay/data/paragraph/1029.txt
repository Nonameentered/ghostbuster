In conclusion, the design of the reduction gearbox for the commercial meat slicer was successful. Calculations were made for the appropriate gear and shaft sizes, the shaft was designed with bending moment and sheer force diagrams in order to ensure that it was of sufficient size. The optimal sizes of shafts and gears were found to be 12mm and 25mm for the shafts and 36mm and 161mm respectively for the gears. The appropriate size of bearings was also selected in order for the shafts to rotate at the specified speed and with maximum load. Finally, the optimal size of housing for the gearbox was determined to be 451.2mm x 335.3mm x 212.3mm.
