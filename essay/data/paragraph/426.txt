In conclusion, the evidence provided above clearly explains the endosymbiotic theory, which is the origin of the eukaryotic organelles; mitochondrion, chloroplast and hydrogenosome from endocytosis of free-living bacteria. Although the origin of undulipodia is still being disputed, evidence supports that at least two bacteria were symbiotically incorporated into the first eukaryotic cell; one for energy and the other for propulsion Furthermore, the evidence stated above suggests that symbionts in the eukaryotic cells are not merely vestigial organelles but have their own genetic material, ribosomes and specialised membrane systems which give them the characteristic of a free-living cell. This is supported by the fact that both mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes and they show sensitivity to antibiotics that affect only the prokaryotes From this process, modern eukaryotes gave rise to the evolution of most of the organisms living today, including bacteria, plants and animals. Thus, it is without a doubt that the endosymbiotic theory is the most accepted theory of the origin of eukaryotic organelles.
