The present study shows that although there is overlap between shame, guilt and embarrassment emotions, they are distinct feelings. Previous research from Tangney (1996) supports this idea, and also that embarrassment is a much more public emotion than the other two. Furthermore, the present study reveals that these feelings are broadly as expected; embarrassment occurs in public settings, more out of the participant's control than shame or guilt, which are linked to letting down others for whom the participant cares about or respects.
