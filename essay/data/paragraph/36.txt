Having discussed the implications for women in relation to gender, and in some ways class, I will now focus more closely upon the class impacts. As the practice of medicine moved away from female lay-healing and towards a male profession many working-class women were denied access to medical care. As it became a profession the working classes could no longer afford to receive treatment, so many went without (Donnison, 1993), and the medical profession focused its attention on upper- class women, claiming they were more fragile and in need of extra help, which further excluded working-class women from medical treatment. The few hospitals set up to provide for the working classes were poor quality, and the women were subjected to harsh treatments, which the upper classes who could afford to pay for superior treatment were not. They were treated as if they were dirty in some way, in a similar way to which prostitutes were handled under the Contagious Diseases Acts (Moscucci, 1990). Upper-class women were able to use chloroform during birth, but no such aids were available to those from the working classes (Donnison, 1993). Such differences in treatment helped to increase the division between the working and upper classes that I mentioned previously.
