By producing connections between two different types of experiences, an inborn link between the different senses can be seen in neonates. Meltzoff & Borton (1979) looked at tactile-visual cross-modal perception by giving infants a pacifier shaped either like a sphere or shaped like a sphere with nubs to suck for 90 seconds. When the infants were later shown the objects side by side it was found that neonates looked significantly longer at the shape they had felt. Neonates could therefore relate the feel of a pacifier in their mouths with its visual image, hence it was suggested that perception is already shaped by an innate capacity for cross-modal communication among sense modalities, implying that perception is not educated by experience.
