Traditional accounts on the causes of the Reformation necessarily included castigation of clerical abuses, such as concubinage, pluralism and absenteeism; the ignorance and poor training of priests and monks; and perhaps even the supposed failure of papal leadership as manifestations of the decay and decline of the Church on the eve of the Reformation. This view, and the more recent revisionist view of the topic in question has informed the main body of debate in scholarly circles, but before embarking on the essay, there are a few points that deserve attention. Firstly, the question suggests that what was 'wrong' with the Church could have led, in some sort of linear equation, to the birth of the Reformation. Following in the footsteps of Peter Marshall, "the intention is not to sift the evidence for signs of impending Reformation" Secondly, it is ambiguous as to what constitutes 'the Church'. According to Robert Swanson, there are two main definitions: "the restricted, institutional definition, which segregated the 'ecclesiastical' from the 'secular'..." and "the body of the faithful which made up the mystical body of the church which was also the body of Christ." To limit the scope of this essay, the first of Swanson's two definitions will be taken up, noting however, that this requires a generalization of the circumstances in the various national churches. This essay will avoid a direct, simplistic answer to the question but will instead attempt to put the criticisms of the Church into perspective and suggest that there was a certain measure of continuity, rather than exclusivity to the eve of the Reformation; and to locate the essay within the confines of the changing climate of opinion that may have contributed to the perceived problems of the Church. The recurrent themes of Expectations and Reform will be examined in the following context: the Clergy, the Papacy, Doctrines and Practices, and will revolve around the issue of the function of the Church.
