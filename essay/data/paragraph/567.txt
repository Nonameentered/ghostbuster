Legionnaires' disease (LD) is a potentially deadly respiratory illness that is caused by the inhalation of aerosolised contaminated water containing the Gram-negative bacterium, Legionella pneumophila. Symptoms vary from person to person however they commonly include high fever, disorientation, lethargy and lung infections. Although other species of the Legionella genus can cause the illness, Legionnaires' disease is primarily caused by L. pneumophila and is easily spread through aerosols or water droplets. The bacterium has a number of virulent characteristics, however the key factors for it's success as a pathogen have been identified to be; its resistance to cleaning agents and water treatment, its ability to colonise and replicate in aquatic environments and amoebae, and its secretion of toxins and other virulence factors such as Flagellin and Mip which are essential for its transmission and survival in human alveolar macrophages. Whilst many of the virulence factors of this organism remain to be discovered, research has shown that particular components of complement (C3 and C5), secreted proteins, bacterial motility, and cell-mediated immunity play a pivotal role in the transmission from water sources to susceptible hosts.  Whilst Legionnaires' disease is seen as a life-threatening illness, a lesser understood, but closely related, form of this bacterium, is Pontiacs Fever. Pontiacs Fever is caused by ingestion of Legionella, which as previously stated, is highly prominent in water systems. The symptoms of Pontiacs Fever are much milder, including fever, chills and headaches, however mortality is rare and no fatalities have been recorded to date.
