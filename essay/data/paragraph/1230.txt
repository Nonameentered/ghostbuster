And finally, although line-ups are based on the premise that the perpetrator is one of the suspects, this is not always the case, and so other measures should also be employed. For example, along with implementing sequential line-ups, witnesses should also be explicitly made aware that the perpetrator may not be present, as this can significantly decrease the number of misidentifications (Malpass & Devine, 1981). As line-up procedures are system variables (Wells, 1993), there are many aspects that can be manipulated in order to produce less erroneous identifications. Fortunately, some US states are now incorporating research based guidelines set by the justice department on conducting line-ups (Willing, 2002) and similar guidelines in England and Wales have also been set up (Wells, et al., 1998). However, although not all guidelines are being adhered to by everyone, the law does generally satisfy them (Kebbell, 2000), and so valuable progress is being made
