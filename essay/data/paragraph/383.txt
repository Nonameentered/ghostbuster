Genetic exchange permits new combinations of alleles. The three most common mechanisms of genetic exchange in bacteria are transformation, transduction and conjugation. Transformation is the process of genetic exchange between bacteria involving uptake of free DNA from environment. Transduction involves genetic exchange between bacteriophage, or virus and bacteria. Conjugation requires the intimate contact between the donor and recipient for genetic exchange. This horizontal gene transfer leads to evolution and the spread of multiple drug resistance. This gene transfer can be between members of the same species, between members of the same genus or even between very distantly related organisms. Conjugative plasmids are self-transmissible and only transfer between very closely related species of bacteria.
