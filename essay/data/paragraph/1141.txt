The dysfunction of the mamillary bodies causes the patient to fail to recall many items or events in the past, if the item is presented again, the patient does not feel familiar with it. They often show disorientation to time and place and may confabulate (fill a gap in memory with a falsification that they seem to accept as true) (Biological Psychology, 2002, p.541). Patients with this disorder usually suffer from some retrograde amnesia as well, but their primary deficit is the inability to store any new information in long-term memory. The symptoms are similar to those of people with damage to the prefrontal cortex, including apathy, confusion and memory impairment.
