Realism offers a different perspective to that of the Individualist and Collectivist by positing that social reality is best depicted by regarding the individual actor and the social structure as distinct yet inextricably linked ontological features. Realists argue that individuals cannot be reduced to the structures around them, as structures are emergent and possess powers that have an effect upon individuals (Archer, 1995; 63). Likewise, structures are not reducible to the individual because structures are the product of many generations of human action, and can therefore persist independent of specific individuals (64). As a result of this view, Realists suggest that the subject of sociology should be the study of the interplay between individuals and the structures they inhabit (66). Realists also address the Individualist's reductionistic viewpoint by forming their concept of the individual from 'cognitive, affective, and volitional states' instead of dispositions (67). Realism therefore promises to fulfil Individualist philosophy's ambition to describe the complexity of social reality, whilst avoiding its methodological errors (such as reductionism).
