We can move our discussion from the late 1930s by seeking to discover what happened then. Again, Appendix 2, shown in Figure 6 below, has much to contribute. The Figure indicates that from 1935, air service expenditure rocketed. This immediate spurt in spending, however, must be seen in light of the preceding two years' budgets, as well as the larger historic developments of the decade. Only with this can we gain a fair assessment of the data. The Figure supports existing discourse, which claims that air strategy, between 1933 and 1939, was characterised by a reluctance to face the future 'The country was fighting against something, but it had not yet found what' We can now pinpoint an end to this visual demurring in the Figure, which shows upwards spending trajectories from 1935 onwards - a robust effort to rouse Britain from her economic torpor and supposed unpreparedness for war. From 1935 to 1938 a 188 per cent rise in air expenditure can be seen. This presumably illustrates the government's endeavour to find that elusive 'something', that England was missing. The Figure, however, fails to explain why this occurred.
