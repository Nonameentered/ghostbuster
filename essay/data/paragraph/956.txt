On the other hand this approach is deterministic as it suggests that people have no choice in their actions and passively experience their environment i.e. they have no free will. A major limitation is that this fails to consider cognitive processes that may explain certain types of behaviour. Humans have been known to display irrational behavior when in extreme emotional pain. In this case, there is a cognitive reason for their behavior. Additionally, in situations of danger, the body engages in a flight or fight reaction which is purely physiological. The behavior of a person in a dangerous situation is not subject to any form of conditioning but merely a specific physiological reaction.
