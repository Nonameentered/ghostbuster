The effects of popularity on psychological development vary with age and situation. To simplify the inquiry however it will be looked at with an age range of 8 - 14. This age range was chosen because it is generally accepted that children form their personality and behaviour patterns within this period and therefore it is possible to look at the implications popularity plays on this process and whether it is causal for the psychological development of the child. Popularity within this range does not typically equate to actual number of friends the child has, for example, Maccoby and Jackling (1992) state that popularity is not considered by the number of friends a child possesses, but is more to do with the level of acceptance by groups the child is associated with, particularly same sex groups. This has implications when looking are popularity and psychological development as if a child has many friends but is still rejected, then it is likely to be even more detrimental to their psychological development.
