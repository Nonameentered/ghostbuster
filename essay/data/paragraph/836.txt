This may account for why children remain unpopular but it does not explain why the child may become unpopular or undesirable in the first place. One possible reason causing a child to be unpopular may be due to them having an autistic spectrum disorder (Hobson, 1995). Unfortunately many of the characteristics displayed by unpopular children are also displayed by children suffering from an autistic spectrum disorder such as Autism or Asberger's Syndrome. Children who are unpopular tend to only view situations from their own perspective, do not value others opinions and cannot empathise with their peers (Dekovic et al, 1994). Autism is a disorder where it is believed children lack a "Theory of Mind". This means that they find it very hard to see the world from any perspective but their own and fail to understand others emotions or social cues (Hobson, 1995). This may lead to the child becoming unpopular as perspective seeing is essential to being popular as are the communication and cognitive skills that someone with autism may lack. This is one reason a child may become unpopular as autism affects 5 in every 10,000 children (Hobson, 1995). If autism is not diagnosed until the later years the child will be in main stream education and more than likely be rejected by peers and possibly suffer the psychological problems associated with rejection which will be discussed later.
