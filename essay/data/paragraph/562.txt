A separate area of stem cell study which has developed over the last decade is tissue engineering; this involves the use of individual cells or populations thereof to construct new tissues in vitro (2).  Tissue engineering can exploit the property of process plasticity and the ability of stem cells to self-renew in order to generate various tissues and organoids (structures which possess some of the properties of endogenous organs). As shown in Figure 6, the process of creating organoids usually involves culturing cells on a scaffold to which they can adhere, differentiate and proliferate (16).  Studies such as those conducted by Jones (15) have shown that by manipulating the environment in which stem cells are grown, it is possible to encourage the formation of holoclones, or cell populations which all have identical sets of progenitor and stem cell compartments. This is shown in Figure 7.
