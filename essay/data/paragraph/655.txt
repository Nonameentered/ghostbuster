There have been a number of stage models of cognitive development in recent psychology, which tend to agree on many points, such as the number of stages and the types of changes, suggesting that each has some merit. Freud famously described stages of development in children, including oral, anal, phallic, oedipal, latency and genital activity, (Harris & Butterworth, 2002), although these were never given much credit as Freud was seen to overemphasise sexual thoughts in young children. Vygotsky focused more on learning as a result of social interaction, but stated that cognitive development was limited to a certain range at any given time. His ordered stages of development included affiliation, play, learning, peer and work and have had some impact on the teaching of infant children, where the 'play' stage has encouraged more play centred learning in the classroom, (Donaldson, 1987). Other similar stage theories , such as that of Jerome Bruner, (Flavell, 1977), differ from these as they are not age dependent or invariant, and include fewer stages, in the case of Bruner, the enactive stage where knowledge is primarily in the form of motor responses, the iconic stage where knowledge is stored as visual images, and the symbolic stage where knowledge is stored as words or symbols. Bruner's stages have had less impact in the classroom, but his iconic stage has encouraged the use of pictures and diagrams in learning. A more recent stage theory, that of William Perry (1970), concentrates on the development of college students (17-21) and has been used throughout the USA in teaching many subjects. It includes nine points of development, from basic duality (one), through relativism (point five), towards commitment (nine).
