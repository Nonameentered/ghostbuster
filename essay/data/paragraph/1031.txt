The debate on the memory of the Holocaust is perhaps the latest issue in the vast ocean of literature concerning other aspects of the Nazi holocaust, and this trend can be traced to the 1980s and 1990s when there was a sudden proliferation of Holocaust memorials, in the form of books, films, paintings and in particular, monuments and museums. The academic value of this enterprise must be judged, and the historian Norman Finkelstein astutely points out that 'currently all the rage in the ivory tower, memory is surely the most impoverished concept to come down the academic pike in a long time." Yet despite this, 'the intensity of the debates about memory and the Holocaust has never abated." The task at hand is perhaps even more disdainful because it is expressed in a normative statement, and seemingly, it beckons to the writer to take part in a doomed enterprise. The role of the impartial judge is one that is hard to play, and though it is acknowledged that the historian's task is not to judge, it is not entirely possible for the historian to distance herself from this issue, because she is necessarily the product of her time. As such, the writer does not profess impartiality, but attempts to bring in the professionalism of her discipline to tackle this issue by first calling into question the assumption that the Holocaust should be memorialised; the social and political functions of these memorials; and finally, by examining the various memorials, aim to show that the forms that memorials take often reflect their position in time and location, and more importantly, is a reflection of the society that has created them, hence the futility of this question, because the form that a memorial takes is not dictated by a single universal principle, but obeys a number of intertwined forces.
