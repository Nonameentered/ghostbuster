Habermas's work is often noted for the many changes it holds against orthodox Marxist work. His critique of Marxist thought is visible in his distinctive area of study; the cultural relations of power in modern capitalist society, which arose from the late nineteenth century, and were not within the usual remit of Marxist study, the economic structure of societies. In addition, his rejection of the structure / superstructure paradigm developed by Marx illustrates his differences to the original work; whereas under market capitalism the economic base was seen as central, under the 'technological' capitalist society of Habermas's time, the superstructure (such as media and education) became much more important. Likewise, his view on economics and class is contrary to the Marxist view; Habermas argued that everyone was now relatively rich, and because of this there was no longer an oppressed class. The last and most significant addition to Marxism, or departure if looked at from the Marxist perspective, is the ideal speech situation Habermas suggests as the key to emancipation from the universal technocratic consciousness repressing society.
