Figure 1: Schematic representation of the ability of haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) to give rise to other haematopoietic progenitors and thus replenish all the cells of the blood (1).  Pluripotent stem cells can be obtained from three sources: primordial germ cells- PG (from the fetal testis or ovary), Early embryonic cells- ES (from embryos) and Extraembryonic germ cells- EG (from early placenta or yolk sac) (2).  The first of these, PG cells are the precursors to gametes and are derived from the germinal ridge (4). In the testis spermatogonia form primordial germ cells which give rise to spermatocytes and eventually sperm. Similarly in the ovary, oogonia undergo meiotic divisions to yield oocytes (4). Development of the PG cells commences around the eight week of foetal development and the cells have the ability to reproduce, differentiate and form any type of somatic cell utilizing processes found in embryonic development (4).
