It is difficult to believe that it was only this position of trust Lenin had in Stalin that permitted his rise to power. It seems more likely that Stalin's personality and his political savvy were of equal value. His political activity was not only confined to the party but extended to his personal life; he was able to build a network of mutual trust and support throughout the party and the state. He was a 'convincing orator and very patient', and able to use '...uncanny method of seeming the reluctant recipient of demanded trust". Kenez has argued that during the years of Stalin's army service and his period in exile he developed the more Machiavellian tendencies in his political activities; these proved invaluable during the 1920's as the situation within the party and the state was largely characterized by division. He was able to use circumstance to his advantage, and utilise endless amounts of patience. This and his cunning tactics of action in the short term and long term were what characterised Stalin's politics, they allowed him the 'luxury of waiting; allowing time do your work where short term gains were irrelevant, he had the patience to utilise the possibility of future gain.'
