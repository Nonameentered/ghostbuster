When looking at why women do not have children, these same personal, economic and social factors have to be considered, as they may very much influence women's decisions not to have children. Personal factors such as freedom, self fulfilment and self production have been identified, as in Andorka's early research which suggests that childlessness can provide women with a kind of liberation, as women 'throw off expectations of childbearing operations' (1978, p364). Personal desires can play an important role, as many may want to experience a lifestyle that is not based upon having children, and this could be very attractive for some. However this is only possible if there is change in the social context that enables this.
