This evidence should have an impact on the way children are taught science. Conclusions are that subject-specific learning would follow the grain of the child's cognitive progression, as research has amply shown. Practically, however, it would be unrealistic to implicate this sort of primary school curriculum, given the intention of the government to keep science as a concept-based subject. Conciliation between the findings of cognitive research and the intentions of directors of education seems the best solution. However as an overhaul of the primary school teaching format is such a big consideration and a major challenge, it will indeed be a progressive process rather than an immediate one.
