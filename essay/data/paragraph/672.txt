Methods  Ten participants, all aged between 19-23, were recruited from a university population. Participants were asked to name three occasions when they would experience guilt, shame or embarrassment, and were allowed to elaborate if they wished. Responses were then looked at for general trends and were categorised as to the type of situation or response given.  Results and Discussion  Responses generally varied but showed certain similarities; for example, almost all respondents claimed regret or guilt in relation to something they had done which had let themselves or someone else down, and was felt most when confided in someone they felt close too. Mixed in with this were descriptions of embarrassment; embarrassment being the only of the three emotions mentioned in the public situations. Embarrassment as a response to these public situations was in its mildest form.
