It can be seen that the hypothesis that first year university students would have significantly more deviant eating behaviour than a control group of matched age non university participants was correct. The experimental group scored significantly higher on the EAT than the control group. It appears that the hypothesis concerning self esteem and peer group influence over eating behaviour was incorrect however. It did not prove to be significant with the MANOVA and the independent samples t test investigating the influence of new friends on self esteem also proved to be non significant.
