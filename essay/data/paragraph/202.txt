The speech aroused immediate calls for democracy, triggering Lenin to respond in November 1917 to these demands It was to be a constitution to establish the governmental policies of the Soviet Union. Initially, even Lenin was willing to accept universal suffrage and party representation in the election of a Constituent Assembly. However, with the October revolution, the Constituent Assembly was dissolved in January 1918 against Lenin's will; the Bolsheviks believed the assembly to be detrimental to the working of the Soviet Republic. This initiative underlined the difference between the planning of a revolutionary seizure of power and the subsequent running of a socialist government based on autonomy and representation. The author of the left socialist novel The Last Summer, Alexandra Kollontai wrote in her article 'Theses on Communist Ethics' in 1921: 'The proletariat must learn to create an organized state power defending the interests of the working classes'. This meant, she argued, that it would have to learn to pass laws and to rule. To do this, democracy would be an important tool: the proletariat had to learn to listen to minority opinions, even if it was not always in agreement with them.
