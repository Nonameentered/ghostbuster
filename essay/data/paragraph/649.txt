As I mentioned in my introduction, one description of Habermas's work in relation to Marx's is as a positive critique, and indeed Habermas believed that '... Marx's analysis needed drastic revision'. (Turner, 1991; 255). Habermas argued that although Marx's analysis of economics and the class structure was perfectly applicable to the era he studied, it no longer held any accuracy for a modern society. Not only did Habermas reject the idea of a working class forced in to labour by a deceitful ruling class, but he rejected the idea that change could be brought about by economics. Habermas argued that the emergent properties of capitalism were cultural not material, and therefore argued that cultural change was necessary for more general change to occur.
