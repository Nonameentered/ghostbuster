This essay will argue that the construction of gender identity is related to Imperialism and racism as the indigenous people of conquered nations provided white Englishmen with an image of 'uncivilised' people with which they could compare themselves to. Initially, it will be shown that the adventure story of late nineteenth century England provided young Englishmen with the belief that it was their right to propagate Imperialism because of their natural superiority to other ethnicities. It will then be shown that the subconscious dissatisfaction many Englishmen had with the restrictive nature of Victorian society was expressed in their enthusiasm for adventure stories set in societies ungoverned by such constraining norms. The contrast between English women and the women depicted in the adventure stories will be shown as reinforcing women's submissive role in Victorian society. Finally, the latent appeal to Victorian men in the adventure stories of a regression to a 'primitive' state reveals racist presuppositions. The essay begins with a discussion of the adventure story's role in reproducing Imperialist ideals.
