Firstly, Postmodernist theory misses the continued critical relevance of class to the events it describes. Class can be used to explain the collapse of the USSR. The New Right traditionally sees this as a triumphant consequence of transnational capitalism and an overburdening system of military expenditure. The corruption, bureaucratisation and nepotism of the Soviet ruling class, particularly in the excesses of the Brezhnev era, ensured the continued oppression and alienation of workers. Against Postmodernist critiques, this alienation of labour and the consequent role of the masses in overthrowing the system suggest the continued viability of class. Secondly, although recognising the New Right's desire to drive class off the agenda - Thatcher called it a 'communist concept' The New Right was simply adept at disguising the language of class within the ideological cover of national security, jingoism and honour. Furthermore, the Postmodernist concept of a 'classless society' inherent in the language of the New Right is misleading. The New Right used the term not to describe a society without class but as the goal of a meritocratic society providing opportunity for people to advance regardless of class. Thus, the New Right is in fact reinforcing the existence of classes that it has only linguistically abolished. Finally, the Postmodernist charge rests on a haphazard assumption that the world is totally equitable under conditions of market capitalism. However, in its latest manifestation, capitalism continues to distribute inequitably its product. There is a clustering of power in the hands of a small homogenous elite, whilst the people of the Third World increasingly live in conditions of chronic penury. Therefore, we need a class element, in order to explain the negative outcomes of capitalism's distributive rationalism.
