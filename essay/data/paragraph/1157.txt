It has been suggested that the potential for authoritarianism is actually quite high, given the right circumstances (Zimbardo, 1971). It is estimated that at least 80% of us have prejudices. Also, Milgram's study of obedience (1971) suggests that 65% of us would physically hurt someone if told to do so by an authority figure. This suggests that maybe there are parts of an authoritarian personality in all of us.
