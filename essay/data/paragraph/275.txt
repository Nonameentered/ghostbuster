In conclusion, this essay has sought to demonstrate that the British Imperialist project was revelled in late nineteenth century popular fiction, and that it reproduced the belief that white males were the natural superiors of all other people, not least women. It has also been argued that this quest for domination was driven by a subconscious dissatisfaction of the Victorian male with the prescriptive, hierarchical nature of Victorian society. This led the white Englishmen to identify with the 'uncivilised' people, whom, it could be argued, did not represent a threat to the preconceived, and thus comforting, notion of a racial hierarchy based upon English superiority. Finally, it was seen that the adventure stories strongly conveyed a belief in, and admiration of, the 'primitive' because it provided an escape from reality whereby the male protagonists could drink in these unfamiliar cultures and, more importantly, manifest aspects of their character which would have been suppressed in Victorian society.
