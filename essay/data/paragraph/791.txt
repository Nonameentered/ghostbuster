London was a vibrant city due its unique combination of economic and political power. The city also had a cultural side which drew people in. Merchants, courtiers and professionals migrated to London to join the wealthy and fashionable society that surrounded the monarch. These members of the Court were a major pull factor in migration. London was where the high society gathered and was host to weekly masques during the time of Charles I. Its theatres were famous and were restored in the later 1620s. What had begun as a partial revival of London's theatrical life became a full re-birth by the 1660s. This provided a major platform for what Berger calls 'the commodification of culture', which attracted people for its association with the upper classes. The rich men who resided in and around the city provided patronage to the arts, which provided work to musicians, architects and artists who migrated to London. They were attracted by the society and glamour of the city.
