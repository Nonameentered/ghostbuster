The stagnation of social mobility can be said to have a two-sided effect. While, one the one hand, it formed a ferment for discontent because the state failed to meet the workers' expectations of equality, Eastern European 'regimes [had to], in a sense, deal with the workers they have'. A further source of frustration was found in the fact that, despite repeated pledges for reform from the party leadership, very little change was noticed, while concessions were repeatedly watered down. Contradictions were experienced very starkly when any kind of protest was followed by measures on a worker's economic privileges and 'any sign of active solidarity' was immediately called 'political conspiracy'. As now the argument of economic prosperity was no longer something Gierek could count on, the social and political situation became something of a ticking bomb.
