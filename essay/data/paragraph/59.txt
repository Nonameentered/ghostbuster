The global changes of the time, which were also known as 'globalisation', caused a decline in manufacturing production in the UK (Jones and Novak, 1999, p33). This meant that as there were less goods being manufactured less workers were needed to produce these goods, resulting in a large number of people falling into unemployment (Faggio and Nickell, 2003). This had an even greater impact due to the large numbers already employed in the industry, which accounted for a fifth of male independent workers at the time (Vickerstaff, 2003). It has therefore been argued that the global changes were a main factor in the increase of unemployment in the 1980s and 1990s.
