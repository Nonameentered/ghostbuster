It has also been proposed than newborns have an appreciation of size constancy even at birth and have been found to habituate to object size and not the retinal image size (Slator, Mattock & Brown, 1990). Hence, they are able to appreciate scale and distance. However, according to the Piagetian theory it is believed that neonates have no innate attentional biases or predispositions and are regarded as just a 'bundle of reflexes'. Thus all aspects of perception and cognition are developed only through active experiences. It may be more appropriate therefore, to consider the presence of size constancy as the foundation for the development of depth perception.
