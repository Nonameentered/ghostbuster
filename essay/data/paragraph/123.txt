To conclude, the design of the department stores and shops of the nineteen century opened the door not only to a facile way of buying, but also to an open acknowledgement and display of a material civilisation that that had once been declared in the Great Exhibition. Whole families could enjoy various attractions; not only could genteel leisure activities be found in their halls, in the upper floors theatres were built and informal concerts, poetry readings, art shows and puppet shows held (Rappaport 1996:61). Even more, goods like bicycles, kites, tennis equipment and photographic supplies showed that consumption could be linked to a moral, pure and civilising way of life (Rappaport 1996:62).
