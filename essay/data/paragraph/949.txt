Likewise in Milgram's experiment, the experimenter seen as authority had commanded obedience of each subject. The experiment demonstrated with jarring clarity that ordinary individuals could be induced to acts of cruelty even in the absence of physical coercion. Humans need not be innately evil to behave in ways that are reprehensible and inhumane. While it was thought and believed that when confronted with a moral dilemma humans would act as their conscience dictates, Milgram's obedience experiments proved that in a concrete situation with powerful social constraints, moral sense can easily be overcame.
