Savage implies the difficulties with conducting this research. Most evidence is collected using qualitative methods, which comes with its own set of caveats. Obtaining evidence by means of a questionnaire, in the manner of Bushman and Geen (1990) for example, is not always the most accurate way to obtain results. Also, the subject of the research focuses on testing children, who may not always treat scientific experiments with the appropriate respect and seriousness. The question of indirect aggression, whether in the form of verbal insults or more subtle antisocial behaviour, has also been studied. This type of behaviour can have just as much of an impact on behaviour as overt aggression (Coyne, Archer and Eslea, 2004), but can be harder to observe in behaviour. This can confuse the research, leading to an inaccurate picture of events. The question of indirect aggression can seem to be the beginning of a slippery slope argument, as one may wonder how far the criticisms of television content will expand in the future. It is also worth noting that much media is allocated an age suitability rating, showing the role taken by the industry to reduce the affects of aggressive imagery on young children in particular.
