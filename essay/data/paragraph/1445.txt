Overall it is hard to predict the behaviour of the pipe if it was replaced with a 6" without a full understanding of the flow properties of the pipe throughout the year, i.e. the air to water content of the fluid. But using models with the best guestimation for yearly flow, it is shown that the upgrade of pipe would produce a 29% performance increase, however this benefit will only be shown at high (winter) flow rates.
