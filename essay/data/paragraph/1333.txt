By taking research into cognitive development to some extent into account, a school could optimise the learning environment for the primary school aged child. It could involve an altered curriculum, based on when a child is ready to learn certain things. Such an alteration would involve subject specific lessons, where one scientific concept is focussed on at one time. For example, five- and six-year olds could be taught the differences between animate and inanimate objects, while the upper end of the same age bracket could begin to learn about heredity, and so on. Information about the properties of force and energy, which were identified as most appropriate to be taught at ages five and six, could be left until the child nears the end of their primary school career. Bennett, Wise and Johnson (1988) argue that teaching science within stages and in steps corresponds with the development of the child's capability to understand different concepts and so enhances their general retention of information. Clearly, for such a curriculum to work, the primary school system must lower the levels of their expectations for the younger aged pupils. It is, of course, important for children to learn more advanced concepts, but only when they are mentally equipped to take in the information.
