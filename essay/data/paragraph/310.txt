The idea of emergence is an important part of realist ontology as it shows how phenomena can have causal autonomy whilst being constituted of entities that lack it; for example, the English language is constituted of words and both emerge from (and are irreducible to) the individual individuals who both use and create them, yet also have causal autonomy from the individuals who constituted them (Archer, 1995; 43). Realism acknowledges the different levels of reality, namely 'the real' (constituted of entities which lack emergent structure), 'the actual' (constituted of real phenomena which have emergent properties) and the empirical (comprised of entities which are the product of human practices including but not restricted to observation) (Bhaskar, 1986; 25).
