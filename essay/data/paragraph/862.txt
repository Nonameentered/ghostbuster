The evidence presented by Pennington and Hastie (1992) and Huntley and Costanzo (2003) appears to support the Story Board Model because when it is applied to jury decision making it demonstrates how jurors compose a story to account for and interpret the evidence. Whilst Huntley and Costanzo (2003) did not follow the same method of evidence presentation as Pennington and Hastie (1992), it did show evidence for a story model in jury decision making because it showed how biasing information is sometimes selectively incorporated into stories. There are credible explanations for the limitations of this research however which will now be discussed.
