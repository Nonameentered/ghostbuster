The study of human memory is of great importance in learning and education, as well as for disorders such as amnesia, and to generally understand the functions and processes of memory. For psychologists, the classification of memory into three categories: episodic (memory for events), semantic (factual memory) and procedural (memory for skills), is useful in distinguishing between different functions of memory.
