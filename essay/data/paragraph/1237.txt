The classic stroop task involves subjects deciding whether the colour of an emotional word matches the letters presented and, it is found that older adults are more susceptible to interference from the semantic information as they tend to show longer reaction times when the colour of the word does not match the word's meaning (Humphrey & Kramer, 1997; McDowd & Shaw, 2000). This discrepancy is thought to be the result of an inefficient process of inhibition (Hasher & Zacks, 1988) and hence this could imply weaker inhibition of irrelevant information or, greater interference from relevant information. Therefore, preferences for individual tasks need to be considered when testing for specific age-related slowing.
