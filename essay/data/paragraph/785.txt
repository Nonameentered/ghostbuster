As Beier and Finlay have asserted, 'London evidently exerted a tremendous pull on migrants from an early date' One explanation for this may have been the unique situation in London in which the capital city was also a great port. One of the main factors that encouraged migration was the centralisation of England's economic life in London. The shift from Mediterranean to Atlantic trade was beneficial to England, and hence to London which was one of the major ports. By 1700, London dominated English trade. It dealt with eighty per cent of imports and sixty-nine per cent of exports. By the mid-1540s London's cloth exports accounted for eighty-six per cent of the country's total woollen exports. Professor J. H. Hexter comments on the number of merchants who 'lived in the town but were not of it, and yet won there that beatitude of riches that enabled them to go back to where they came from' Men would come to London to make their fortunes as merchants. The cloth trade 'unquestionably stimulated London's economy and migration to the capital'
