As well as being especially vulnerable to these changes in the labour market structure, the risk posed to the young was further increased by government policies. They blamed youth unemployment on what is known as the 'deficiency model' (Mizen, 2003), which argued that the reason the young were out of work was because they were restless in work, had no incentive to be there, or did not have the qualities needed for employment. This meant they received little support from the government to protect them from the dangers of unemployment. Therefore overall the recent changes in the labour market, technological advances and government policies have made the young a group particularly at risk of unemployment.
