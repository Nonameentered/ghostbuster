The acquiring of colonies was seen by many countries as the means by which they could attain the status of world power. This is particularly so for new countries like Italy and Germany, which saw their participation in imperialism as heightening their world standing. For an established nation like Britain however, imperialism was a defensive reaction, derived from a sense of insecurity and threats from newly industrialising powers like Germany, America and Russia, and the subsequent assertion of her power. As for France, she saw imperialism as the opportunity for the expansion of her army and navy; the role successful imperialism would play in exorcising her defeat in the Franco-Prussian war of 1871, and rebuild her status as a world power. Germany's fear of encirclement also played a part in the formulation of 'Weltpolitik'. It was not only the external fear that countries were trying to undermine each other in the race for colonies, but more importantly, there was the fear of internal degeneration, and that imperialism was the cure to the diagnosis of national ills, revitalising the country, restoring its self confidence, and reinforcing its power abroad.
