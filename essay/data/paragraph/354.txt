more than front line types (for example, Germany devoted far larger amounts of production than Britain to trainers), and they give us no insight into how many of the aircraft delivered were immediately deployable, through pilot availability and other factors. Also ignored in assessing proportional difference in air strength is the contribution of anti-aircraft defences. The contemporary historian, therefore, needs to take these sensitivities in his metaphorical knapsack when he enters the archives.
