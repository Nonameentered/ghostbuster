The experiment was then repeated using a mixture of cytochrome c and haemoglobin. Firstly the mixture of molecules was added to the buffer-barbitone and electrophoresis was then used to identify the charge of both molecules at pH 8.6. This was done by placing the sample at the origin of a piece of chromatography paper and passing current through it. After forty minutes both haemoglobin and cytochrome c had reached the end of the paper and could be seen as two distinct spots. The distances travelled by both molecules were then measured and the pH of the buffer calculated. The calculation for pH is shown on page fourteen of the appendix.
