Another group at risk to high unemployment were those living in traditional industrial towns, especially in the North and West. Statistics show that whilst the rate of official unemployment was only 8.4% in the South East, in the North West it was 14.7%, and in the North 16.6%, indicating that industrial areas were at a higher risk of unemployment (Jones and Novak, 1999, p41). Within these areas places such as Yorkshire, Scotland and Humberside were the worst affected, and Ashton et al found that a young man's chance of being unemployed in Sunderland was one in three, compared to only one in thirty three in St Albans (1988, cited in Coles, 1995, p39).
