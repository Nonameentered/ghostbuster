Many of the ideas that Darwin proposed in his On the Origin of Species had been discussed by the Romantics in the decades before he published in 1859. For example, 'William Wordsworth and other Romantic writers' wrote of how species changed over time. Unlike the more conservative pre-Romantic naturalists, many of the Romantic writers were questioning old beliefs that species were immutable. Charles Lamb, in his essay and Mary Shelley's book Frankenstein, both suggest that new species could be created. Coleridge was 'the first English writer to give his full acceptance' to the idea that species could change and develop. Even though the Romantics were not evolutionary thinkers they had an understanding that nature was a dynamic and ever-changing system. This is an idea that Darwin adapted and developed.  The Romantics 'cast a sceptical eye on popular theological ideas about the self-evident nature of God's creation and the fixity of species' They began to look for alternative explanations for the world around them. Wordsworth states in his Tintern Abbey that 'We see into the life of things' The senses were seen as the path to knowledge in the broader Romantic philosophy.
