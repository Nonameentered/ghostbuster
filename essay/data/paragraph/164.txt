Simmel's writing on the discipline of sociology, then, is characterised by an attempt to bring about a 'serious [...]analysis of the social bond' (Nisbit 1959: 479). Rather than viewing society as an external, generic force reifying itself through organisational structures and artefacts, Simmel proposed that the social sphere ought to be viewed primarily from the individual's standpoint. To this end, he proposed that the understanding of a society should be built upon the recognition of the tension between various opposites, such as the individual and the collective, or stability and flexibility. Simmel believed that the tension between these opposites creates underlying forms-of-sociation, which act as generally discernable traits in a variety of social circumstances. He further argued that the greater the number of links through sociation, the more the social sphere becomes "society".
