On the ground floor, a more reactive atmosphere exists, possibly generated by children's books being mixed in with standard fiction and other popular books, and the fact that books related to newer scientific discoveries are (maybe by unintended consequence) located in this part of the shop, although indeed there is also a science table downstairs. This may explain why the customers on the ground floor exist of a more diverse collective: they are young, whereas on the first floor the customers generally are between forty and sixty years old; there couples and single people; people with an interest in modern scientific literature, and people looking for a book for their children.
