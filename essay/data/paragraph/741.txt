Europe, on the other hand, possessed an advantage in its state control: it was politically fragmented. Differences in governments created competition between countries, which led to the desire for economic superiority and the emergence of city-states. As Van Zanden observes, only in Europe did city-states 'manage to dominate the socio-political and economic life of large regions' Many merchants believed in the phrase England and the Netherlands- perhaps the most advanced European states during this period- established an equilibrium between central authority and commercial interest groups, providing them with the ability 'to mobilise resources on an unprecedented scale' The mutual benefits of compromise between government and mercantile interests influenced European legislation, for both English common law and European Roman law protected property rights. This removed some of the vulnerability of entrepreneurial nous and thus encouraged economic development. Such an attitude was enhanced by financial changes; In East Asian government monetary matters were controlled by individual rulers, whereas European financial institutions were independent both of government whims and the fortunes of individual merchants. The Bank of England provided independent checks on the state of the economy and concept of partnership came into fruition with the Dutch pioneering of a joint-stock company. As Van Zanden concludes 'social and political relationships in Western Europe appear to have been less hierarchical than in large parts of Asia' Repressive government in an increasingly global economy was not conducive to economic progress.
