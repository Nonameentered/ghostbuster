Apart from the conditions surrounding massacre there are further commonalities between all of these countries. During the Holocaust, the Jews were dehumanized to make it easier to commit murder, 'including so-called "racial science", the use of "minimization rhetoric", propaganda against the Jews and the use of special militarized police units to systematically execute them' The same can be said of the Armenians, for between 1915-18 hundreds of thousands died due to 'the dictates of government policy, and the victims were to be denied, in large measure, their essential humanity' In Cambodia, it is estimated that up to 900,000 people died through the Pol Pot regime, however as with the Armenians and Jews of the Holocaust, these deaths were only possible through relegation of basic human rights: 'millions of Cambodians were forced to abandon their homes, and to submit to a brutal regime of labor, starvation and execution' In Bosnia, it was not detachment from humanity that enabled massacre, but rather dehumanization of victims as a means of psychological defense from the hatred expressed by the Serbs and Croats. Its Serbian militia were 'literally referred to as "wolves" who had been released to slaughter 'wild animals'' and in this way massacre in Bosnia was possible due to 'psychological fiction in which Bosnians became a kind of abstract evil overcome by a heroic militia action'
