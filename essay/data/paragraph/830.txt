To further reduce researcher bias and increase validity the concept of Grounded Theory has been developed to help remove researcher bias. It suggests that theory should be built up from the observations rather than prior theory (Henwood and Pigeon, 1992). This reduces the chance of the researcher trying to fit the observations made to a prior theory, and also increases the chance that what is being measured is actually there rather than what is expected to be there (Henwood and Pigeon, 1992). There are however problems with this method as no researchers can approach an investigation without prior expectations.
