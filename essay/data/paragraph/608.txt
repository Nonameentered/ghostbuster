Finally, I would argue that although the 1905 revolution did not bring about an overthrow of the existing order, to class it as a failure is too simplistic a categorisation. To a large extent the aims of many of those involved were achieved, at least in principle if not in reality. Furthermore 1905 was an essential factor in the eventual revolution of 1917, allowing people to see that they did have some power to change the system, alerting them to the shortcomings of the government.
