Replications of this study would be useful in order to clarify and extend these findings. Different sources of information such as visual images or numbers may give rise to different results; it cannot be said whether or not these findings are limited to words only. Additionally it would be more relevant to everyday situations to test memory whilst actual conversations or television recordings are played as background noise, or to test long term memory by delayed recall. Conditions could also be extended to include another language, white noise, music or timed beeps. This would clarify exactly what kind of noise is distracting to memory; all noise or just speech, all speech or just speech of a viable language.
