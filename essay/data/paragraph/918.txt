Overall I would argue that The Meme Machine provides a detailed and interesting account of the concept of memes, and certainly does provide some plausible theories that appear to be explained better by memetics than any other theory we currently have available. However, I believe that in attempting to use memes to explain all aspects of human nature and behaviour, Blackmore takes memetic theory beyond logical boundaries. Furthermore, Blackmore restricts memetic transmission to imitation, claiming that imitation is what sets us apart from other animals; however Tomasello (1999) argues that whilst imitation has played a role in cultural evolution the critical difference is in fact the understanding of others as intentional beings like the self. Thus, if the basic principle of cultural learning being driven solely by imitation is rejected the foundations of The Meme Machine collapse and there is no reason why we should accept any of Blackmore's arguments. Critics also argue that just as a gene is nothing without its biological and environmental context the same is true for memes (Wheelwell, 1998; Dupre, 2000), and indeed it is difficult to conceive of memes as cultural units residing in brains that exist independently of contextual interpretation. However, proponents of memetics argue psychology will be as transformed by this discipline as biology was by Darwin (Brodie, 1996), and this perhaps is where the problem lies in getting people to accept memetic theory. In acknowledging the existence of these cultural replicators we have to radically transform our ideas regarding human nature, behaviour and motivation and reformulate our understanding of how and why culture evolved, just as Darwin caused us to rethink our beliefs about the origin of our species. Maybe we are too scared to accept we do not have consciousness, free will, or the possibility of rational choice but rather are completely at the mercy of the interaction between our memes and our genes? Whether the theory of memes is true or not, The Meme Machine provides a comprehensive and detailed insight into how memes may shape human development which, although somewhat unbelievable in parts, is certainly an interesting and enlightening read.
