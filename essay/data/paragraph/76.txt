Victorian notions of women's madness were largely influenced by the Victorian Domestic Ideology; paramount during the nineteenth century in defining gender roles, responsibilities and acceptable behaviour. This primarily concerned the middle classes, establishing ideals of womanhood and femininity that were arguably damaging both to those directly targeted as well as other groups within Victorian society striving to emulate the middle class depiction of morality, sobriety and modesty. At the same time, the notion of madness as a disease was becoming increasingly apparent within Victorian society, further highlighting gender and class divisions through varying perceptions of madness and its origins. Whilst there were significant implications in terms of gender, this essay will mainly deal with the effects of social class on women's experience of madness in Victorian England.
