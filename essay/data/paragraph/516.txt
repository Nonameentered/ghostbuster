In order to find the isoelectric points of haemoglobin and cytochrome c we undertook the method of electrophoresis. This method did not enable us to calculate the exact isoelectric points of the two samples, however, due to the fact that a mixture of the two molecules was subjected to an electric field of a relative fixed strength (this was the result of using a buffer-barbitone with a pH of 8.6) we were able to determine that the net charge of cytochrome c was greater than that of haemoglobin. This information therefore indicates that the isoelectric point of haemoglobin was closer to pH 8.6 than that of cytochrome c.  A method which would have allowed us to calculate the exact isoelectric points of both haemoglobin and cytochrome c would have been to mix known concentrations of the molecules with buffer solutions of different pH. A series of samples could then have been taken from each buffer solution and the isoelectric points determined using the electrophoresis technique. This would have enabled us to compare the degree of movement of each molecule in the different pH buffer solutions and thereby calculate the exact isoelectric points of both haemoglobin and cytochrome c.
