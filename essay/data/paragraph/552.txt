A second safety issue is the improper differentiation of implanted cells or development of tumours after transplantation. This concern has come from research such as that carried out by Tada in which EG cells were used to study the changed in epigenetic modifications in the germ line by analysing the effects on a somatic nucleus (11). Analysis found that the presence of EG cells caused 'striking changes in methylation of the somatic nucleus, resulting in demethylation of several imprinted and non-imprinted genes' (11). Such modifications were shown to be heritable and affected gene expression (11). This and other findings of a similar nature therefore reinforces the idea that differentiated cells rather than stem cells may be more suited to transplantation.
