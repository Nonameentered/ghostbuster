where  R = resistivity of material (Ohm-m) l = length of conductor (m) A = cross-sectional area of conductor (m2) First, I need to establish the voltage and current that will be travelling through the pantograph. I will choose a high voltage and limit current to reduce losses. The Health and Safety Executive, states in their publication GS9: 'Fixed installations having a single point-to-pointvoltage up to 750V AC or 1500V DC and any LV DC system with voltages up to 1000V will then require only the normal requirements for access, egress and double insulation of all exposed live parts of the electrical equipment and internal wiring'.7 750 V AC stipulated as the maximum voltage as this point, but DC is acceptable up to 1000V, so I will go for 800V. Because of this high Voltage, the current through the wire will also be quite high. An equation can be used to estimate this. Because the voltage is quite high, even at 800V, we want the losses to be as low as possible. This means considering resistivity of the material chosen.
