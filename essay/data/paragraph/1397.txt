With the points in groups we could now hopefully create a list of questions (given earlier) relating to those groups, whose answers will hopefully cover the points in the respective group. We can now compare the questions (6-10) and see that because of this grouping of points and backwards though processes involved in selecting groups, no two questions are related. Also there is more breadth to the questions. For example, questions 8 and 9 may cross paths talking about the lifespan of a system, but can't give answers that can have similar points. Compare this to questions 1, 2 and 4, which can all talk about hardware. i.e. question 2 could easily go into the hardware of the current system, and question 4 could say what hardware the company my need/has purchased to run the new system on. Both leave question 1 obsolete.
