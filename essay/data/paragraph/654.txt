Dividing development into distinct stages has occurred in many areas of psychology, but most frequently in cognitive development of children and adolescents. There has always been disagreement as to whether development should be categorised in stages or whether it is a constantly moving process which never stops. Flavell (1977) suggested that stages in development must show distinct, qualitative changes rather than differences in quantitative ability. He also noted that transition between stages must incur several simultaneous changes in many areas of cognition, and that these transitions should be rapid rather than gradual. Some psychologists have tried to suggest that development is an accumulation of small qualitative changes over time, causing smooth, continuous improvement, called linear dynamics, (Harris & Butterworth, 2002), however most parents and teachers will agree that children's development does feature many sudden periods of growth.
