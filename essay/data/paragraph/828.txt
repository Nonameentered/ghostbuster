To increase reliability and validity of the qualitative method a different definition of these two terms applicable to the nature of the qualitative method needs to be established. Merrick (1999) defines reliability when referring to qualitative data as the provision of circumstances in which observers can agree on the interpretation of data taken from the same source. He defines validity as the intention to measure what actually is present in a given scenario. This suggests that within qualitative data there is still a measure of reliability and validity, simply because of the ability of the analyst to agree that the same interpretations have been made from the same source, ideas which echo those of Glaser (1962) who suggested that qualitative research is accurate and reliable by its own definition regardless of traditional criteria.
