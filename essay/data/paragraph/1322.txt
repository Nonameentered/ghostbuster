When the pretend NGO representatives made suggestions for particular developments they were met with firm, almost fierce, objections from the village representatives who felt that the proposal did not offer the best solution or, as some said, any improvement. These objections were not from a few isolated villagers but were supported by much of the village cohort. This in itself does not refute the effectiveness of PRA since effectiveness should be measured by the level of success of the implemented proposals rather than their popularity amongst villagers prior to their instigation. However, it seems unlikely that very unpopular proposals would be more successful than popular ones.
