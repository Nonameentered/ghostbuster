This study does however appear to have further implications for line-up methods. Whilst photo line-ups provide a means of quickly surveying multiple suspects, as this case shows, comparisons maybe made on the basis of suspects pictorially rather than upon absolute judgements, thus increasing the chances of misidentification. Research by Wells (1984) has suggested that a sequential line-up, whereby witnesses view each suspect one by one rather than all suspects simultaneously, could reduce this. This is because it would encourage absolute judgements, as suspects are then compared to an internalised image stored in memory, before another suspect is shown; (Loftus & Zanni, 1975).
