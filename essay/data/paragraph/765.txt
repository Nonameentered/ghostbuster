Despite this, Florence was a key centre of Italian humanism from the start of the fifteenth century until the early sixteenth century. It can even be argued that 'Florence was humanism in Italy' Humanism suffered a period of decline during the latter half of the fifteenth century. It was partially due to the printing revolution which led to the proliferation of printed books. Universal education was now available in printed form and did not rely on humanists anymore. Humanist scholars would no longer be employed by wealthy families such as the Medici and Strozzi. Nor would the studia humanitas receive the generous funding that it had previously. It was also due to Savonarola's religious revival which had been hostile to the humanists and scholars of Florence.
