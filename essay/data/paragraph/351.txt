It is immediately apparent that only a small shift away from bombers towards fighters occurred. This is by no means supportive of existing discourse. Literature on 1930's air power recognises the shift but argues that it was much more pronounced, with production geared three to one in favour of fighters. However, Figure 11 indicates that, in receiving well over 40 per cent of total aircraft production, the bomber remained the main player in air strategy, notwithstanding a greater emphasis to fighters. Thus, the pie charts provide an empirically tested challenge to the current epistemological understanding of the period.
