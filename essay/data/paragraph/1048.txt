Cultural aspects of imperialism cannot be easily overlooked, in the context of Europe at the peak of its power during the late nineteenth century. This was the era of Darwinism, racism, and the obsession with any 'natural' or invented superiority among the white Europeans. It was of belief that the 'inferior' native population was in need of civilisation, and European domination was seen as 'indispensable for the progress of the world.' Trade and commerce was also seen in a moral light as contributing to the 'cultivation of the natives, making them gentler, more trustful, and more civilised.' Colonisers wished to lift the 'savage out of his slothful and degraded condition, and to raise him from barbarism to civilisation.'
