As Alfred Crosby notes 'it is impossible to doubt that the transfer of Old World foods and livestock to the Americas had an immense impact on the Indian' From Columbus' discovery of the New World in 1492, European travellers brought a host of animals, plants and seeds across the Atlantic and many of these were assimilated into the Indian diet. However, the speed and success of such reception varies among the different foodstuffs that colonisers attempted to introduce; whilst meat and vegetables complemented the indigenous diet, attempts to present wheat as a superior staple to maize were far less successful. Many of the products cultivated in the Americas were primarily for the consumption of colonial settlers, or indeed exportation back to Europe, and therefore although there was some acceptance of Old World products into Indian diets, on the whole it was not until the eighteenth century onwards that a genuine fusion of cuisines began to take place.
