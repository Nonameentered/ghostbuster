In Roger Chartier's article He contemplates the possibility that it was not the Enlightenment that implied revolution, but rather, the converse, that it was the latter that constructed the former. He states that the retrospective construction were many-the 'canonisation' of Voltaire and Rousseau, by the revolutionary assemblies, as the intellectual fore fathers of the revolution, while others such as Buffon and Descartes were relegated; in the quest for legitimacy, political celebrations were held in Year II, honouring the philosophes and martyrs for liberty. The articles in the Declaration of the Rights of Man, which expounds on the freedom of Man, may have led to the belief that it was the Enlightenment that was the ideological inspiration behind the revolution. Perhaps it was a retrospective justification for the revolution and to put the revolutionaries on a moral high ground, since they were now seen not as mere rebels, but as agents of progress. Hence, 'it was the revolution that gave a premonitory and programmatic meaning to certain works, constituted, after the fact, as its origin.'
