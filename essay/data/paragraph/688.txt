The results can be explained using Baddeley's model of working memory, (1974), in particular the phonological articulatory loop. It is likely that participants used silent verbal rehearsal as a technique for learning the printed words, and that words heard over headphones that were related were confused with those being rehearsed silently and wrongly encoded. However at the same time the results contradict Baddeley's findings from a study of memory for word sequences as a function of acoustic, semantic and formal similarity, (1966), which found that semantic similarity did not impair memory. It can be said that this experiment is more specifically focused on semantic relationships than Baddeley's, ignoring phonological similarity, and therefore the results are more pronounced. It could also be seen, though, that the results are the product of an engineered situation and do not mirror other environments. It is possible that subjects were more confused by auditory information than usual because it was presented over headphones which block out other noise. In other situations continuing background noise is blocked out, but this may be more difficult when using headphones. Reassurance can be taken from the fact that the unrelated condition gave higher mean scores, therefore subjects were able to block out the noise to a greater extent. Other potential problems might be seen in the experimental design, for example in that only ten words were given to be learned in the study phase. It is possible that this is too few, meaning subjects learn words then are distracted by audio sounds. It would be beneficial to change one or more of the fixed variables to see whether the same results are gained.
