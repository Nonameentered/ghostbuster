Radkey claims that the 'Greens simply lacked the initial military power to affect the outcome of the war". However due to the environment of the civil war and the number of varying peasant and worker movements, this assumption can not always be applied. Britain, America, Japan and many others had more resources than the Soviet Union but that did not seem to help them in the war against the Whites. The Whites were defeated because of their lack of organisation, morale and communication. The Greens on the other hand, only began with small uprisings. Radkey holds the view that there would have been many more rebellions if the Bolsheviks had not 'imposed a strong authoritarian regime in the wake of the civil war.' The Bolsheviks used the notorious Cheka to keep order in the country, and this would intimidate people into submission and end their rebellious behaviour. The Bolsheviks also politised peasants to fight harder against the Whites, with propaganda promising improved living conditions. The Bolsheviks managed to break down any unity amongst the Greens by offering land to the peasants they desired and by taking measures to strengthen links with the workers.
