Thus, "telling the code" becomes both a powerful tool and a warning. Its inherently shaky foundation in terms of both content and form reveals it as a means of manipulation, of which Wieder claims that one of its goals 'may be understood as an effort to convince staff and myself that 'this is so' and/or to 'defend' against potential staff challenge regarding 'this is so'' (Wieder 1974: 151). Besides this, it can, however, also be used in order to protect prisoners, as staff learned to use their power in conjunction with norms, 'in its more humane aspect as a way to 'excuse' violations, to 'protect' one prisoner at the expense of another' (Wieder 1974: 152). Thus, Wieder sees "the code" as, at once, both a fragile structure of power asssersenment, and a protective shield that guards individuals from even harsher measures.
