The social aspect of eating behaviour which influences hunger and satiety levels is largely learned and therefore could theoretically be altered. In the same way, it seems that willpower could potentially suppress cravings and over-ride intrinsic metabolic rates. However, whilst the discussed biological factors do play an important role in weight regulation, the underlying mechanisms such as homeostasis give us an evolutionary predisposition to prevent weight loss, making it difficult to lose weight. Considering all these factors, though willpower contributes to weight loss, wilful changes on behaviour seem to have a relatively small impact and are difficult to sustain. It appears that eating behaviour is largely biologically driven and the notion that weight loss is exclusively a matter of willpower is too na
