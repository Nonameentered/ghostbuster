In conclusion, from the research that has been conducted so far in this area it is clear that stem cells in their different forms, obtained from adult and foetal tissues, hold much promise for the treatment of numerous diseases and medical conditions. These cells hold the prospect of regenerating lost tissues and curing diseases which affect millions of people throughout the world. However before this can become a reality many research endeavours into the understanding the factors which regulate stem cells in their natural behaviour are needed so that controlled differentiation can be effectively achieved. In addition to this, safety issues such as immune rejection and infectious agents have to be addressed before any clinical application can be considered.
