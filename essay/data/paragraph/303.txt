Chapter one of this dissertation will introduce the realist ontology and associated epistemology as developed by Roy Bhaskar and Margaret Archer. It will be maintained that the strength of the realist ontology is such that all deficiencies associated with the traditional ontologies available to sociology can be highlighted. Chapter two will discuss Margaret Archer's influential The Making of Modern Social Theory (TMGAt), which launched an immanent critique of both the individualist and collectivist ontologies from a realist perspective. It will be shown that the criticisms Archer launched are valid on a methodological level, yet her subjection of the criticisms to a realist ontology provides a positive contribution to the construction of an adequate ontology. In other words, Archer provides a worthwhile complement to Bhaskar's realist ontology.
