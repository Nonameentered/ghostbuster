Selective attention is one of the mechanisms we use to manage complexity. As it is not possible to attend to everything in the environment, we tend to inherently select the relevant and filter out the irrelevant. Studies into selective attention generally involve a task in which the aim is to select the relevant information and ignore any distractors; hence a decrease in speed or accuracy would suggest a difficulty in filtering out irrelevant information. However, studies of aging and selective attention reveal various age-related deficits, which also appear to divulge information regarding other areas of ageing. For example, these studies can provide insight into the specific attentional processes affected and the ways in which they are affected. This essay aims to provide a review of ageing literature on selective attention, discussing the experiments and theories that arise from them, illustrating that our knowledge from this type of research can not only provide valuable insights into other theories of ageing but can also help us to improve life in old age.
