Previous research has more than adequately shown that the presence of others affects our behaviour (most influentially Allport, 1920; Zajonc, 1965). Specifically, studies have concluded that the competitive nature of human beings is provoked when in the company of other people (Triplett, 1898). This experiment aims to investigate how much of an increase in group size is necessary to make a difference to an individual's performance. In this experiment, 60 participants took part in a task where they were asked to put eight sets of four words in alphabetical order. They did this either alone, in the presence of one other person, or in the presence of four other people, who also performed the task. A significant decrease in the amount of time taken between each of the three conditions as the group size increases was predicted, as well as a decrease in accuracy as response times decreased. The results were analysed using one way ANOVA, and showed a significant effect of speed but not accuracy as a function of group size. These findings could affect performances in a variety of capacities, including in professional roles and home and academic life.
