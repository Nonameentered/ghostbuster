A clustered box plot revealed three outliers which could not be explained, two in the 4-5 years group (both girls) and one in the 6-7 years group (a boy), however, reanalysis with these excluded yielded the same pattern of results so the outliers were included in all analysis. Scatter plots of the mean difference scores against their standard deviations showed no obvious relationships, suggesting the homogeneity of variance assumption was not violated, therefore the data was not transformed but used in its raw form. The results were then analysed in a three way within groups analysis of variance (ANOVA), of sex (2) x age (3) x score (2), with difference score as the dependent variable. ANOVA outputs showed a significant main effect of distraction condition on inhibition times, F(1,90) = 83.465, p<0.05 and a significant main effect of sex, F(1,90) = 6.342, p<0.05. However there was no significant main effect of age, F(2,90) = 1.809, p>0.05, no significant interaction between age and sex, F(2,90) = 0.235, p>0.05 and no significant interaction between age and distraction condition, F(2,90) = 1.261, p>0.05. The interaction between distraction condition and sex was significant at the 5% level but not at the 1% level, therefore further research would be desirable in order to make firmer conclusions, F(1,90) = 4.562, p<0.05. Despite ANOVA revealing no significant main effect of age, a planned linear contrast over age did prove significant, F(1,93) = 5.914, p<0.05 for the quiet condition and F(1,93) = 461.15, p<0.05 for the distraction condition. Post hoc comparisons between age groups (Tukey HSD) showed no significant differences except between the 4-5 group and the 8-9 group in the no distraction condition, but again, only at the 5% level, p=0.046, therefore this outcome will be disregarded in case of chance significance.
