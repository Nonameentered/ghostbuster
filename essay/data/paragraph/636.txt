The first factor which I want to look at in my argument is the economic disjuncture which existed between the ideal of a woman's social position, and the practicalities of the economic sphere. To begin with, Widows and unmarried women were used to working, previously as aprentices or servants, but many others such as midwives and dairymaids were able to maintain themselves by working outside the home. Most women were not such independent earners; they worked with their husbands in family businesses, and received a salary as such. The most 'dangerous' socio-economic phenomena contributing to the gap between theory and practice were urbanisation and the successful trades. In towns and cities because of the growing need for labour women working in domestic trades such as baking were able to support themselves without the need of a husband, which was anathema to their prescribed social positions. Urbanising trades and guilds opened further doors for women; instead of simply being apprentices to their fathers or husbands, they were actively recruited by masters in the same way men were. Similarly women were able to find work in the celebrity trades such as printing; but even here they had to ensure that their work did not conflict with their household duties; having to find the time to work when their husbands and children were not in the house.
