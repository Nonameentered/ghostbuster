The adventure stories of late nineteenth century England allowed men to imagine a regressive, hierarchical, environment in which the oppressive, yet victorious, white Englishman could subjugate anyone standing in their way. This idea was particularly attractive in an era where Victorian societies imposed so many restrictions on their male inhabitants (Showalter, 1991; 87). This longing for autonomy can be seen in Kipling's In he describes the actions of the 'naked, brown, fanatical' horde as acting with a 'wild intensity of purpose' and this contrast with the restrained nature of Victorian society served to make the Imperialist project even more attractive to the Englishmen (265). The images of dissolution presented by the 'savage' people portrayed in the adventure stories reinforced the notion of masculinity that was essential to the Imperialist project.
