Simmel announced the method proposed by him as sociological in the fullest sense, saying that 'when each individual may be brought into a reciprocal relation to the form which is the distinctive and general character of the association, the problem of sociology takes on an aspect of the utmost importance' (Simmel 1971a: 24). This essay will aim to locate the position of Simmel on the subject of sociology, and focus upon the way Simmel substantiates and applies the concept of "forms-of-sociation" as a tool for sociological studies. It will argue in conclusion that Simmel succeeds, to an extent, in providing us with a tool to analyse microsocial relations, however has difficulties dealing with more impersonal social structures.
