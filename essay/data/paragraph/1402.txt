At the start of the cycle, exhaust gases escape via the exhaust port as the piston moves upwards. At the same time, the air/petrol/oil mixture in the crankcase that was compressed by the piston moving downwards enters the combustion chamber. As the piston reaches the top of the combustion chamber, both the intake and exhaust ports are closed and the mixture is compressed. Just before the piton reaches the top of the chamber, the magneto lets out a high voltage pulse, which causes a spark between the electrodes on the spark plug, which ignites the fuel. As soon as the air intake is closed, the crankcase becomes decompressed and so more fuel mixture is sucked into the combustion chamber by opening the reed valve.
