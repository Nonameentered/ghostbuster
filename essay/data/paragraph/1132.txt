Damage to the fusiform gyrus can disrupt an individual's ability to retrieve information especially visual memories, such as the remembered face of a friend. If a tumour destroys the fusiform gyrus of the right temporal lobe then the left visual field will be affected. A lesion in the fusiform gyrus is associated with the loss of colour perception; this is known a central achromatopsia. Patients are usually aware of the deficit and report the world as being grey or 'dirty' and it can also affect one colour more than another (braincampus.com).
