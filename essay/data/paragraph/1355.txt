Other research examines the role of gender in this debate. Though much evidence shows no significant differences between male and female responses to viewed aggression (Huesman, Moise-Titus, Podolski and Aron, 2003; Wood, Wong and Chancere, 1991) there have been some important studies exploring female response. Hoggan (2000) looked at whether the perceived harmlessness of violence was determined by gender, and concluded that while male violence could be seen as less harmless when compared to female aggression, boys and girls of a similar age experience the consequences of seen violence in the same manner. Coyne, Archer and Eslea (2004) went further and studied the effects of viewing aggressive films separately on male and female primary school children. Their results indicated that male children were more susceptible to the effects of viewed aggression, from both media and film, a point reinforced by Anderson and Bushman (2002). While these results imply that more attention should be given to male viewing habits, they also demonstrate the complex role of gender on the matter. This research, in line with other work, challenges the reductionistic stance of social learning theory in terms of the effects of viewed aggression on behaviour, and serves to remind us of the possible influence of biological differences on this controversial matter.
