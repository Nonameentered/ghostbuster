The government's role in the war cannot be underestimated; the leadership of Stalin, Zhukov and Vasievsky was necessary, but often overestimated. The 'new found effectiveness of the Red Army came from circumstances rather than from the ability of Stalin and his generals." It was another factor than Stalin's leadership that won the war. Stalin did not possess the military genius of Hitler. Stalin just needed to hold the line and keep the army together, using first Zhukov and then Vasievsky as the military commanders. Also, there was massive propaganda sending out a steady stream of highly emotional music, stirring speeches and dignified soldiers. This increased morale and accompanied with the fear of execution if they did not fight increased the commitment of Russians. Therefore it had a role in the war victory, although it was not significant. The propaganda was not effective in places like Leningrad where the people were in the middle of the siege and they saw nothing of what was going on elsewhere in the country. Thus it had most affect in areas where people remained and were not facing direct battle.
