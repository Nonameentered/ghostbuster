The development of feminist thought and action in Japan is distinct from that of its emergence in the West, more specifically within the United States and Britain. Though influenced by Western politics, the development of feminism in Japan was also initiated by numerous other social and political factors that affected the political climate at that specific time and place. Adherence to Confucian ideologies severely restricted women within Japanese society, as well as subordinating the working classes and those not owning property. A growing political awareness and imperialist competition later led to the struggle for social reform, of which women were arguably at the forefront. This essay will deal with such social and political factors as these to account for the development of feminism in Japan.
