The time after the Black Death was ' a period of impressive technological achievement' As the population had decreased, labour costs were high which meant that great rewards were given to inventors of labour-saving devices. Also, with less demand for food there was more room for innovation and experimentation. The depression of the fifteenth century led to the development of the labour-saving, light, one-slit plough. Away from agriculture, there were advancements in other areas such as the invention of Johann Gutenberg's printing press in 1453. This replaced the large teams of monastic copyists whose numbers were decreased significantly during the Black Death.
