Overall, the results from the Ways of Coping Questionnaire appear to be quite significant and generally provide strong evidence that those individuals drinking at hazardous levels are more likely to rely on emotion-focused coping, and in particular on avoidance coping, when confronted by a stressful situation such as an overload of academic work, than those who are drinking at lower levels. It should be noted however that the degree to which people rely on avoidance coping also varies, since although heavy drinkers scored more highly than light drinkers on the distancing scale, they did not score uniformly highly on all of the pure emotion-focused scales, thus indicating that the way people cope in stressful situations varies widely, even between heavy and light drinkers.
