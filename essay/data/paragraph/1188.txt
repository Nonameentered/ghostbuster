Research indicating a preference to the mother's voice isn't conclusive- some has shown evidence to the contrary. This discrepancy can be explained by the findings from a study by Spence & Freeman (1996). Body tissue in the womb acts as a low pass filter, where higher frequencies are attenuated to a greater extent than lower frequencies, rendering much of the speech unintelligible. It is these low frequencies that give speech its prosodic (temporal and rhythmic) properties. It was found that neonates could discriminate between whispered voices but did not prefer the maternal whispered voice to a stranger's. They did however prefer the mother's low-pass filtered voice to a stranger's, suggesting that the prosodic qualities of the mother's voice were discriminated by the infant. These vocal properties are available pre-natally, once again suggesting that prenatal experience is crucial in shaping preferences.
