To conclude, as I have shown above, it is important to consider the cultural and economic situation in which the 1905 revolution took place in. Although this was an uncomfortable and turbulent period of Russian history, Russia at this time was not unchanging. People were reconsidering their position in society, leading many to think that a possible outcome of their actions could be reform of the existing society. Poverty and oppression of the partly educated workers, peasants and minority groups is a significant cause of unrest in Russia. The improved literacy rate as well as the spread of anti-Tsar propaganda by intellectuals among the lower classes, had led to new ideas of revolution. Furthermore the Tsar had gone to attacking the Japanese forces in part to divert attention from the despair and discontent at home. The Tsar's reaction on Bloody Sunday to oppression and a call for better life conditions, was ill thought out, causing a ripple effect which further alerted people to their rights and the government's capacity for reformation.
