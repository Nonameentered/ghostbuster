Having children can also provide women specifically with a higher status in society, as mothers are glorified (McDaniel, 1996), and many women may wish to be regarded highly by society. It is also argued that children can give women more power in the domestic sphere, as nurturing is seen as naturally linked to women, so they are given control over this area (Gittins, 1993), and therefore see it as a way of gaining more power within domestic relationships.
