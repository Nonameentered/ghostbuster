Mitochondria (Figure 4) are like a cell within a cell and can be divided into five compartments: matrix, inter-membrane space, inner membrane cristae, outer membrane, and nucleoid. This organelle is made up of four compartments, involved in the production of ATP from glucose The inner membrane contains a network of infoldings called cristae, in which the electron transport chain, the electron transport proteins and ATP synthase are located The matrix contains enzymes for oxaloacetate synthesis and enzymes involved in the Krebs cycle The outer membrane is freely permeable to small molecules, which enables the ATP to leave the mitochondria The inter-membrane space connects the inner and the outer membrane, where the molecules needed for the electron transport chain and Krebs cycle can pass through. The evidence suggests that mitochondrion is the byproduct of endosymbiosis of an anaerobic eubacterium by an ancestral anaerobic eukaryote. In addition, the mitochondrion generates energy in the form of ATP via electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation
