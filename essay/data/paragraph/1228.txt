To conclude, this essay discussed three areas of psychological phenomena that can contribute to wrongful convictions. It could be seen how child suggestibility and hypnotic suggestion can lead to the generation of false memories, and even with the lack of false memories, misidentifications can still occur due to systematically inadequate police procedures. Firstly, it appears that in order to reduce wrongful convictions, awareness about child development and interviewing techniques should be implemented into the legal system, to ensure correct procedures are being adhered to. Secondly, any recollection coming from hypnosis should also be used with extreme caution, to prevent incorrect identifications or worse, false confessions. Lastly, police procedures should also be seen as a crucial area, as they can also lead to misidentifications. It has been seen how even the most common bias present in line-ups, relative judgement processes, can produce erroneous identifications and that they must be rigged with certain precautions to reduce the likelihood of misidentification. However, it is also apparent that research is ongoing and the UK is currently looking into ways in which to reduce incorrect identifications.
