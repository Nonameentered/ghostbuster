Technological advances also impacted as many of the jobs they displaced were in the manufacturing sector, which was a major source of youth employment, but also because it meant that fewer apprenticeships were offered (Coles, 1995), so the young could not get the training or the experience needed to enter the labour market initially. Burnett supports the idea that it meant that the young lacked the higher criteria requested by employers due to economic decline, but also points out that at the time adult wages were changed to apply to 18 year olds as well, not just older workers (1994), so it was now no cheaper for employers to hire young people.
