There are many reasons as to why the young are so vulnerable to these changes. It is argued that they are especially vulnerable to the business cycle anyway, as in times of recession businesses cut their recruitment and training and inflate the experience and qualifications needed for financial reasons, as do Trade Unions, who aim to protect their existing members, meaning that the young have very little opportunity to enter into the work force. Also due to statutory redundancy payments it is cheaper to sack those who have been in work for the shortest period, and this usually applied to the young (Mizen, 2003). However, although this does make the young more vulnerable, the reasons why they became one of the highest groups in unemployment in the 1980s and 1990s has to be placed in context.
