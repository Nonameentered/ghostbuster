On a note, however, it must be added that much of the question of the relation between humanism and the reformation depends on definition. Kristeller has rightly pointed out that humanism, taken in a broad definition, 'was not [...] Catholic or Protestant, [...] although it is easy to find [for both of them] a certain number of humanists who favoured them'. Naturally, humanist achievements did much to aid reformist criticism of the church, thereby unintentionally damaging the pope's authority as ultimate arbiter of religious matters.
