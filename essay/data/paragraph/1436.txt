The cost of new turbines would be too great for what is planned here. A new turgo turbine would cost in the region of A fully installed turbine would cost in the region of One option would be to run a centrifugal pump as a turbine. This would involve running a normal water pump at roughly 50rpm above its rated speed, with a maximum power output of 0.7 of the rated power consumption. For a pump that can produce up to 2kW as a turbine, this would cost roughly This will be increased to take account of electronics involved in controlling the frequency of the power output, as it would now be higher than 50Hz.
