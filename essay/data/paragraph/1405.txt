There are 3 faces which interact with other components. Just before the choke the face is machines flat to connect to an air filter by 4 bolts taken through holes in the unit. Another face has a lipped edge to accommodate a fuel hose with a rubber dome. This dome can be pressed to push extra fuel into the choke tube, thereby increasing fuel/air mixture. Commonly called a tickler. The face opposite the choke end is machined flat to be attached to the inlet ports on the engine via bolts located through holes on the face. A gasket between the two faces ensures an airtight fit. The carburettors are not susceptible to much wear, only where the spindles of the butterflies rub against the bores in the carburettor. This may be minimised using lubricant.
