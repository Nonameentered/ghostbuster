The different views of female madness between the classes can be further examined through considering the various institutions created specifically to house female 'inmates', namely asylums and homes. Whereas asylums were seen as too expensive and unhygienic for the lower and working classes in regards to treating their madness, the upper classes were able to pay to rest there, balancing societal norms of femininity with the popular diagnoses of insanity. Yet, those who could not afford such care were sent to large workhouses and industrial schools that were basically self-sustaining prisons in themselves. Surveyor General Edmund R. Pease claimed in his 1851 report that these places were 'instruments of punishment. There is not patience and perseverance enough on the part of those in charge to enable the female inmates to become honest and industrious'.
