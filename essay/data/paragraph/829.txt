As with quantitative research, it is possible to reduce researcher bias in qualitative studies. This in turn increases the validity of the analysis. To reduce the chance of researcher bias in-depth training is needed involving the techniques of coding and analysing texts (Whittaker, 1992). Training could also involve different techniques for investigating and analysing data and the recording of data in a systematic way (Whittaker, 1992). It has also been suggested that a framework of analysis should be established at the start of an investigation (Whittaker, 1992). This would involve the development of questions and categories to be used for analysis of the data and would provide a standardised method (Whittaker, 1992). It is also possible for the researcher to use multiple coders to analyse and interpret the data. Different coders would produce different interpretations and with a greater number of coders involved a conclusion could be reached as to when a general agreement had been reached. The rules and criteria used by the coders can then be outlined allowing another coder to repeat and analyse the same material (Whittaker, 1992).
