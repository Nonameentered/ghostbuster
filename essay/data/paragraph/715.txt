Henry Wooton comments in the novel that 'crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders' In particular the theatre owner is described as 'a hideous jew' Similarly, the other characters involved in the play are described in an equally derogatory manner- the orchestral conductor as 'a young hebrew', Romeo as 'a stout elderly gentleman, with corked eyebrows...and a figure like a beer barrell' and Romeo and Mercutio together as 'both as grotesque as the scenery' Dorian Gray in fact comments on the theatregoers as being 'common, rough people with their coarse faces' The concept of a 'coarse face' is particularly relevant to Lombroso as he believed that degenerates had identifiable physical features due to the atavistic nature of their faces and skeletons. He notes criminals in particular as exhibiting a prominent jaw, long arms and large ears- all somewhat animalistic and Neanderthal qualities. Wilde uses the idea of biologically backward appearance to enhance his depiction of the lower classes.
