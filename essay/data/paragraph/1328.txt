Simons and Keil (1995), and Gelman and Wellman (1991), show that four and five year old children understand the differences that exist in how animate and inanimate objects are supposed to look on the inside as opposed to the outside. Krist, Fieberg and Wilkening (1993), found that capabilities in a task testing knowledge between distance and speed emerge later, at five- and six- years old. At this age, children were able to accurately apply some spatial knowledge to such situations, while ten-year-olds accurately link distance and speed in their explicit judgments. It is appropriate, then, to teach five- and six- year-olds the basic principles of speed, acceleration, force and energy. Inagaki and Sukiyama (1988), illustrate that in their sample of children aged from four to ten years, children become gradually more able to attribute human, animal and physical properties to the appropriate objects. This research indicates that even the simplest of abstract concepts about the world should ideally be taught when children are at the uppermost end of the appropriate age bracket and can produce more accurate attributions. It also shows that an understanding of the differences between the living and material worlds exists from an early age, and that an altered science curriculum incorporating these findings could build a foundation for when the child learns more complex things, for example the differences between the respiratory systems in plants and humans.
