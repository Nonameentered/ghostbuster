Memorials are also essential to the foundations of political legitimacy in that 'by themselves, monuments are of little value, mere stones in the landscape. But as a part of a nation's rites or the objects of a people's national pilgrimage, they are invested with national soul and memory.' This is particularly true in the case of Israel, whose political foundations rest firmly on the back of the Holocaust, to the extent that according to the historian Peter Baldwin, 'the singularity of the Jewish suffering adds to the moral and emotional claims that Israel can make ...on other nations." Having defined themselves as a people through commemorative recitations of their past, 'the Jews now depend on Memory for their very existence as a nation.'
