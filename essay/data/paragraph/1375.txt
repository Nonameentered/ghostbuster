Looking at the two main choices, aluminium and copper, both create a stable oxide on their surface once exposed to the elements. The oxides are stable at constant temperature. However, copper oxides grow if the copper is heated. If the copper is heated for a lengthy amount of time, then eventually the metal will harden and break. This is why it is especially important to make sure the copper has a good connection, therefore higher tolerances in the joining processes need to be observed.
