The position of men, especially the unskilled, in the labour market has been further undermined by the global changes and technological advances that were taking place in the 1970s (Faggio and Nickell, 2003). The movement of production to developing countries meant that many unskilled and manual jobs were displaced, and it was previously men filled these positions. These developments therefore make men more vulnerable to unemployment, as the jobs they formerly had no longer exist, and the new jobs emerging in the service sector were seen as better suited to the innate skills of women.
