Although psychological effects of dementia on caregivers in terms of stress, illness, anxiety and depression have known for sometime now (e.g Maciejewski, 2001), research into this area has been in consistency undertaken over the past two decades (e.g Stoller, 1988). The most commonly reported effects on caregivers are physical and psychological health problems, sleep deprivation (Gilliard, 2001) and isolation (Gill & Doke, 1994). Moreover, the strain on the caregiver themselves can begin to heavily eat up into other areas of their life causing impairment in their social, occupational, educational and recreational activities. Having discussed the psychological effects on the patient, I now address the impact these have on the caregiver. As previously mentioned, the psychological effects on both the patient and the caregiver are frequently mirrored, hence any deterioration of the patient's mental well-being could probably be expected to cause an increase in stress on the caregiver's mental well-being also.
