The HA titre was determined by determining the dilution point at which the last agglutination was seen. In the X rows of table 1, the 7 The HA titre of the virus was concluded as 6400 which can be calculated by doubling the dilution factor for each well (2x2x2x2x2x2x2=64). This shows that the concentration of the virus in the original stock is 6400 HA units/ml. From the HA titre, a dilution of the original virus stock was prepared such that it contains approximately 160 HA units/ml.
