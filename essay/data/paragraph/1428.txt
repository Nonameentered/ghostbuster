All these variables and presumptions go into creating Table 1 and 2. A glossary of the column headings can be found in Appendix 4. This model can then be used to predict the performance increase due to the increased pipe diameter. Using the assumptions I've made here, it is estimated that the installation of the new pipe, with Grid connection, will only become more profitable than the current system after 24 years (Graph 2).
