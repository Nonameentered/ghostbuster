By 1930 Stalin had not only managed to gain extensive personal control and eliminated all his opponents but had also managed to consolidate this power. Accountable to very few Stalin was free to pursue any policy largely unchecked. He had support from the party rank and file as well as from the central committee and the Politburo. With his death Lenin left a vacuum within the party leadership creating economic, social and political uncertainty. This in turn led to a left / right divide within the Politburo over the next steps the Bolsheviks should take, with Trotsky on the left arguing for rapid industrialisation. Stalin's other main rivals faded away either in to political destruction, suicide, execution or expulsion.
