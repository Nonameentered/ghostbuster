The fact that Florence was in a prime position for trade made it an important centre in Renaissance politics. Florence was a republic, ruled by a Signoria, who were Florentine citizens of noble birth. In the fifteenth century, Florence was one of the wealthiest cities in Europe and was known for its commerce as well as its culture. By 1500, Florence was the pre-eminent banking centre of Europe and dominated the culture, politics, and economy of north Italy. The Medici banking family, led by Cosimo de'Medici, ran the government of Florence and, in many cases, the government of the other city-states in the region.  An aspect of the Renaissance that has been attributed to Florence was the rise of humanism. Humanism is the study of classical antiquity, as embodied by ancient Latin and Greek authors, to form the basis of educational reform in Wales. Florence was a centre for humanism, mostly through the activities of the Medici family. Cosimo de'Medici, his son Piero and grandson Lorenzo were all patrons of humanist scholars. Lorenzo invited the renowned philosopher, Marsilio Ficino, to start an academy in Florence and pay scholars to translate ancient texts. Florence was the ideal city for humanists to live in because it was free from the interference of the Church and built on the classical heritage of the Roman Empire.
