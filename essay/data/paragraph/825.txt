The format of the questionnaires may also have proved a problem. To increase reliability and validity three established questionnaires were used to create one. The main problem here is that all three used a slightly different scale. This may have caused confusion for participants, who might have used the wrong scales whilst answering questions. Experimental care was however taken by explaining in prose form at the beginning of each questionnaire that a different scale was being used for each section. The scales were also repeated every time questions continued onto a new page so participants would not have to rely on memory to use the scales. Human error may however have meant some participants may have used the wrong scale for the questionnaires. Other issues may have influenced results such as whether participants had a boyfriend at university. This may have increased self esteem levels and reduced the effect a new peer group may have had over individuals who had boyfriends. Also the distance from home participants were may have had an effect. Participants living closer to the university may not have had such low self esteem as they are still relatively near to their parents. In further research it may be beneficial to account for these individual factors.
