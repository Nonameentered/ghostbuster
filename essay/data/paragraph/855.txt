Further evidence that the human visual system should be able to accommodate a fourth wavelength specific cone comes indirectly from Neitz, Carroll, Youmauchi, Neitz and Williams, (2002). They demonstrated that the visual system is plastic and can adapt to environmental stimuli after it is fully developed. Neitz et al, (2002) asked people to wear coloured filters to alter their chromatic experience. They found that as a result of this there was a shift in colour perception which lasted for nearly two weeks after the filters had been removed. This shows the nervous system's ability to use experience gained from the environment and adjust the inputs to the red and green channel to accommodate this. The implication of this is that if the visual system can adapt and change inputs to the red and green system to external stimuli, it should also be able to do the same to internal stimuli, such as receiving input from an extra photopsin.
