Despite the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, genes encoding for some of the proteins of these symbionts are found in the eukaryotic nucleus. Some of these genes are transcribed and translated in the cell nucleus, and then the final products are transported to the symbionts In addition, some of the bacterial-derived nuclear genes have adapted in the platting of alternate pathways, or alternative modes of energy production in eukaryotic cells This gene transfer between the prokaryotes and the host eukaryotic cell is known as lateral gene transfer
