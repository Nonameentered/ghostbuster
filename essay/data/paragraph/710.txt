In every case, prior to the slaughter, some form of unrest had occurred, and this is a common factor between both the Armenian and Holocaust genocides. The former was a result of the 'control and regulations on social, economic and religious activity, that had been imposed on the Armenian minority of Turkey' Similarly, the start of the Holocaust was caused by Germany's 'declaration of a new order' in 1933, and the aggression against Jews and other minorities, which created the totalitarian Nazi regime. The Bosnians also suffered an unstable transition with the fall of the Yugoslavian state in 1992, a process Prober says 'created dangerous competition between the new nation-states over natural resources, cultural identity, and most importantly, land' The Pol Pot era of 1975-79 in Cambodia can also be attributed to instability after civil war as the nation fought to rebuild itself and thus the 'genocide was a response of the communist party to reassert control over the re-emerging Cambodian nation' In all these instances, the instability before the onset of slaughter proves a link between the different annihilations, and the fact that movements of revolution allowed the perpetrating regimes to implement their rule through persecution.
