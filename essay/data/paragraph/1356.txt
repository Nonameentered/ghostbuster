Such evidence does suggest that concern should be shown about the relationship between viewed aggression and aggressive behaviour. While it illustrates the short term effects of children viewing aggression, other studies have implied that negative consequences in the long-term are more a cause for concern. There have been two influential studies investigating these consequences. Johnson, Cohen, Smatles, Kasen and Brook (2002), found a significant association between viewing aggression in adolescence and the likelihood of aggressive behaviour in later life, including robbery, threatening aggression and antisocial behaviour in general. In the second study, Huesman, Moise-Titus, Podolski and Aron (2003), longitudinally examined the viewing patterns of children aged six to nine, and found that fifteen years later, exposure to violence and aggression on television in youth leads to such behaviour in later life. This evidence implies that aggressive imagery on television can have more serious ramifications for the future. Aggressive behaviour can lead to delinquency at a time of life when employment, familial responsibility and chastisement by law are salient concerns. This evidence puts the effects of viewed aggression into context in the larger sense, showing its potential to affect the child in later life. Moreover, it provides an experimental basis for Bandura's social learning theory.
