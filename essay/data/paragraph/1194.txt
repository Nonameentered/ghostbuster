However, not all visual perception is developed so early on, object permanence the realisation that an object still exists even if it cannot be seen, displays a very gradual development. Piaget (1954, as cited in Baillargeon, Spelk, & Wasserman 1985) believed that newborns have no initial sense of object permanence, that it gradually develops during the sensorimotor period and that full object permanence must show ability to actively search for hidden objects. As a result, object permanence is not considered to develop fully until about 18-24 months.
