Without the oligodendroglia cells forming myelin, nerve signals would become slowed or even completely blocked, thus causing symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. In MS T-cells from the immune system become sensitised to the myelin basic protein and begin to attack it, this causes the body to try and repair the situation. Therefore in the initial stages of MS the oligodendroglia cells are not destroyed, but produce more myelin to compensate for the myelin being attacked. This causes the symptoms of MS to disappear, but only until the myelin degenerates again.
