The emergence of feature-integration theory (FIT) has given us a further insight into the processes underlying age differences in selective attention (Treisman & Gelade, 1980). FIT suggests that visual identification of relevant information in a display involves two processes: feature extraction (the selection of an individual feature from an item) and feature integration (identifying items through combining multiple features). FIT suggests that with age there is a decrease in the speed and accuracy with which features can be integrated; thus we see age decrements during conjunctive searches. The Conjunction Search paradigm provides support for the FIT as the presence of conjunctive items (multiple items possessing the same features) should result in an increase in reaction times, and studies have found a linear relationship between the number of items in the search array and the reaction time (Madden et al., 1992). Certain experiments have also shown that as display size increases it has a greater effect on older adults (Rabbit, 1965). These findings suggest that not only is the efficiency of determining a target item affected, but so is the efficiency of suppressing irrelevant information (Groth, & Allen, 2000).
