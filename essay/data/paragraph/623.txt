First, the fertility figures Wrigley and Schofield employed were taken from family reconstitution studies surveyed from a very limited number of parishes, often very small, and consequently may not be representative. It is possible that the demographic regime within these parishes differed greatly from those beyond and therefore the results could be inaccurate. As J.S. Wrigley himself notes 'for thirty years this same county of Essex provides figures which I suspect are less reliable as an indication of national trends than any other set available.' Moreover, the patterns which Wrigley and Schofield drew up from estimates of marriage patterns, nuptiality and fertility rates were necessarily unrepresentative due to a lack of evidence about non-church marriages and the parental influence on when children married. Although the marriage patterns they used were a vital part of their model, and therefore valuable, it is also worth noting that marital patterns changed over time and thus a static model of nuptiality and fertility is an inaccurate application of history.
