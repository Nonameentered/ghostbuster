This essay aims to discuss three areas of psychological phenomena that have been found to account for a vast number of wrongful convictions, tragically affecting the lives of many people. It appears that the majority of wrongful convictions arise from eyewitness error (Wells, 1993). In light of this, this essay will use criminal cases to demonstrate how false memories could be induced into eyewitness accounts, by examining both child suggestibility and hypnotism, and will also how, even without the implementation of false memories, the complete misidentification of a suspect is possible. From a legal standpoint it is extremely necessary to be aware of these psychological phenomena and their effects on individuals, as it could help to not only diminish the amount of wrongful convictions, but also help convict more of the guilty.
