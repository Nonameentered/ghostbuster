A huge amount of literature exists on short-term memory, possibly because it is easy to test, and often focuses on the performance of memory when subjected to background noise or distraction. Often noise such as traffic, types of music or volume is used, although there are a few studies which look at the effect of speech - both meaningful and irrelevant - as a distractor. This is valuable research when considering the relevance of noisy situations in real life, for example in the classroom or when trying to focus on one conversation. Hygge, Boman and Enmarker, (2001), compared the effects of road traffic noise and irrelevant speech, played through loudspeakers at 66dB, then tested recall of word lists and a comprehension task. Based on previous research on irrelevant speech in short term memory (LeCompte, 1994; Martin et al., 1998; Tremblay et al., 2000), the prediction was that speech would disrupt recall from episodic memory more than traffic noise, as irrelevant speech should tax limited resources for parallel semantic processing.
