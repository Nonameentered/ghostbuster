Quantitative statistics must be performed on the results to try to quantify any findings, in order to gain confidence in the results. To ensure validity the method must be defined, i.e. what was studied, by what methods, why and by whom. Once the results are broken down into data, the researcher can calculate descriptive statistics, e.g. correlations, frequency distributions and dispersion. Results can also be divided by grade, subject or year to quantify differences. More complex statistics can also be used, e.g. multiple regression analysis enables the researcher to identify a range of dependent and independent variables, thus investigating causal relationships. Also when repeated results have been found, then statistical tests can be used to confirm these and thus increase confidence in the results.
