The first gene to transfer would have been the gene controlling the production of a F pilus allowing conjugation, that is the F factor itself, and it appears from the results that this is the case as no growth is seen on any of the plates until 15 minutes where both plates lacking arginine (plate 1) and with xylose as the sugar (plate 7) showed growth. It is likely the F pilus gene is located close to the origin of transfer and so its incorporation into the recipient strain would come early in the process. Additionally the plate 2 lacking histidine did not show growth until 120 minutes, one of the latest time points, thus this gene is located late in the process after transfer of the other gene has already started. It is likely that the gene for the production of histidine is close to the end of the chromosome and so is one of the last genes to be transferred.
