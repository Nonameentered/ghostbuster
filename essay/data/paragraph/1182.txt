From the day a baby is born, it already appears to comprehend much about the world it has just entered into. As a newborn, it then continues to learn even more about its environment at a phenomenal rate. Research has shown that newborns are at a point in their life when they are most open to new experiences and as a result, their minds are most conducive to maximising their learning potential (Gopnik, Meltzoff & Kuhl, 1999). This essay focuses on the newborn's knowledge of the world, analysing their interactions with both people and objects, whilst also assessing whether this knowledge of the world is innate or acquired subsequent to birth, via their interaction with the world.
