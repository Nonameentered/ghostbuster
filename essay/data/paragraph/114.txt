The nineteenth century was, until recently, predominantly seen as a century of rapid industrialisation which set the stage for profound social change. This way of thinking about the birth of a capitalist society, however, fails to recognise the two sides to the changes that took place. After all, not only was there rapid increase in supply, also was demand of consumer goods ever increasing (McCracken 1990:5). Earlier examples of cultural consumerism in various forms of frequent local gift exchange could already be found in the late eighteenth-century (Finn 2000:143). However, consumerism in the Victorian period took a different and much more broad-based shape through various agents, of which most importantly department stores and an 'unparalleled advertising craze' (Loeb 1994:5). And while men in the eighteenth-century were themselves participating consumers in an informal, pre-capitalist local economy, in the last decades of the nineteenth century mass advertisement of an impersonal character began to target almost only women as their potential customers (Loeb 1994:8) in a highly formalised mass commercial economy.
