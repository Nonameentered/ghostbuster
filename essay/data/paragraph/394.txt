The aims of the experiment are to determine the HA (haemagglutinin) titre of a virus stock, to identify that virus on the basis of reactivity with known antisera and to determine the HI (Haemagglutination inhibition) titre of the specifically reactive serum by the combination of the HA and HI assays. Using haemagglutination property of certain viruses and end point dilution, the concentration or dilution of virus required to give the last positive haemagglutination, or the end point dilution was determined. This end point dilution gives the HA titre of the virus, which was 6400 HA units/ml and there was 2.88 x 10 Using this HA titre of the virus, a stock of diluted virus containing approximately 160 HA units/ml was prepared. As antibodies are specific, this precise haemagglutination prevention was used to identify the virus present. Similar to HA titre determination, the concentration or dilution of antibody required to just prevent haemagglutination was determined. This is known haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titre and from this, the HI titre of antiserum was 3200 HI units/ml. The virus was given was identified as influenza A virus.
