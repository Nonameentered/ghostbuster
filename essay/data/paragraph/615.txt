In terms of the political stealth Stalin demonstrated during the 1920's leadership struggle, the battle between Trotsky and Stalin is a revealing example. In particular the contrast between their political styles is interesting; Stalin a more typical politician tentatively weighing up policies and seeking out support; Trotsky a rather superior, aloof character, forthright with his often unpopular views on policy, and expecting support to find him. Stalin seems to have exploited the fears of the other Politburo members that Trotsky remained their biggest threat in terms of personal power. It seems doubtful that his motivations for the alliance with Kamenev and Zinoviev were based on anything more than a wish to remove Trotsky from the leadership race. With this kind of backing behind him Stalin 'carried battle in to the wider field of the central committee where he could always secure a majority." Trotsky's potential support was either alienated by his brusque manner, or undermined by Stalin; the committee was reminded that he was a previous Menshevik, and of the many disagreements he had openly had with Lenin. Stalin often used the disagreements and arguments of the past, out of context, as a tool against his rivals. Stalin was able to use Lenin's ban on factions to make punishable Trotsky's attempts to argue his case, and at every chance undermined him; however when the committee called for action to be taken against Trotsky, Stalin defended him and bided his time.
