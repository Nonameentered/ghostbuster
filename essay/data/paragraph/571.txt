By examining the processes occurring within such water storage and distribution systems we can gain an increased understanding of why more and more outbreaks are being recorded. Firstly, as with any surface, biofilms form within water storage systems. A microbial biofilm consists of bacterial colonies attached to each other and their surface by the secretion of adhesive polysaccharides. In adverse environments, i.e. nutritionally deficient conditions, biofilms trap essential nutrients (for example iron), providing a rich environment for bacterial growth. As the number of large-scale water storage and distribution systems has increased, more buildings now contain reservoirs of In practice, these reservoirs cause an increased threat to humans due to inadequate cleaning and water treatment standards which don't remove the organisms before they have chance to replicate and spread to potential hosts.
