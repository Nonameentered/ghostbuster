A few topics cannot appropriately summarise a subject which has been studied for centuries. Moreover, there does exist much research which suggests that not all elements of Piagetian theory have been borne out by empirical evidence (Crowley and Gogate, 1998). For example, Piaget (1952) puts forwards the notion that children absorb knowledge through "concrete activities and learning through play". However, Conti-Ramsden and Botting (1999) reported that study of the cognitive development of children with language impairment disproved these secondary aspects of Piagetian theory, as disabled children do not necessarily master scientific concepts through physical play. The overwhelming evidence, however, indicates that subject-specific cognition develops as the child grows up. It implies that the Piagetian equivalent of teaching concepts and not subjects, is not the most appropriate way of educating primary school children, in terms of improving their knowledge in the sciences.
