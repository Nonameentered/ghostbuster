The militants' adoption of a more conflictive attitude, however, was not without criticism. Historians have often argued that the tactics adopted by militants were too extreme in contrast to the constitutionalist position, which supposedly enabled an earlier concession of the suffrage to women (Harrison 1978). It is nonetheless, also superficially evident why the suffragettes deemed drastic means of protest necessary. In 1906 the Suffrage Ownership Bill was discharged again by the parliament and speculation of a long-term strategy was felt among the suffragettes (Vicinus 1985). A continual and prolonged struggle was felt necessary in order to put the issue on a higher terms in the political agenda. Women should be seen everywhere, and the WSPU subsequently adopted a 'protracted endurance battle' (Vicinus 1985). The need for attention was felt great, as the increasing working-class involvement in politics had shifted the government's attention away from the female vote (Vicinus 1985). During the militant phase of the campaign, the suffragettes had to constantly re-establish their position in the struggle for the vote
