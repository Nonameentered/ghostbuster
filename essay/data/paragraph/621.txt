The demographic trends that Wrigley and Schofield have mapped out for early modern England begin with growth between 1541 and 1661; this growth was generally steady although it slowed during the 1550s and became rapid in the 1570s and 1580s. Between 1656 and 1686 the population decreased in size before stagnating and slightly recovering between 1686 and 1750. From 1750 onwards the vigorous growth of earlier periods was resumed, although Elizabethan growth rates were not reached until the 1790s. Thus there were two periods of growth divided by one hundred years or so from the mid seventeenth century to the mid eighteenth century when population numbers stagnated. As I have suggested this basic information seems both plausible and realistic, however Wrigley and Schofield's interpretation of this information; an attempt to understand what caused this rapid growth, check and decline followed by renewed growth, seems less plausible. Or in other words, was it fertility or mortality that was the definitive factor in determining these population trends.
