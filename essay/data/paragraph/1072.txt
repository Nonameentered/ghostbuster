In conclusion, Davis's hypothesis, while novel, is not entirely convincing. The arguments of the other historians are a lot more persuasive, both in establishing a link between the various individual 'Ranter' leaders (despite the running debate about 'core' vs. 'milieu' which was not dealt with in this essay) and in their efforts to draw out some semblance of similarities between the various groups, while conceding that it impossible to define a coherent set of 'Ranter' ideology. This is not far off from Davis's own assertion that what would make him believe that the 'Ranters' existed would be the coincidence of two sort of evidences: that the existence of a group (or a number of groups loosely linked) can be established and that its shared ideology was reflected behaviourally in practical antinomianism. Perhaps one might cheekily suggest that Davis's own 'recantation' is overdue.
