In an ever-increasingly commercialised public sphere and with products becoming available that promised a 'refinement of one's home and one's persona', an ideology began to emerge of a genteel commodified middle class (Rappaport 1996:67). As the middle class was now no longer defined only by elite leisure, but also by comfort and pleasantness, 'the middle class man [and woman] strove to be a "Universal Provider" for family and home' (Rappaport 1996:73). The admiration for the military in particular came to signify a strong conviction in the power of discipline, 'rational thinking' and organised consumption (Loeb 1994). These values were echoed in advertisement. For the holidays of Easter and Christmas, department stores advertised through the 'family love and matrimonial tenderness, which marks these festivals' (Loeb 1994:17).
