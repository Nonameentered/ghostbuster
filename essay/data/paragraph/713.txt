Therefore, overall, whereas each twentieth century massacre occurred in very different manifestations, at different times, and for varying periods of time with differing scales of death, they do share some fundamental characteristics. In the cases of the Armenians, the Holocaust, Bosnia and Cambodia, all massacres involve the persecution of minority groups threatening the government, and the annihilations themselves were carried out in an unstable post-revolutionary climate. In all five examples warfare made massacre possible, and this is a crucial common factor between the countries as the ability to perpetrate such large-scale murders was only possible under the veil of warfare. Also, many countries felt the need to dehumanize victims in order to commit massacres and therefore not only were there similarities in the characteristics of their causation, but their methods of coping with atrocity.
