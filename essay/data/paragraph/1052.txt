An examination of purely economic and cultural aspects of imperialism has failed to truly grasp the essence of this significant event in history. The economic and cultural aspects were more of consequences rather than the causes of imperialism, and should be put in their correct places, under the broader themes of Power, Rivalry (stemming from Nationalism), Fear and Regeneration, which are interrelated concepts. Even so, the economic and cultural consequences were in fact additional benefits to be gained from imperialism, and not the actual aims that the imperialists wanted to achieve.
