The book consists of four parts comprising some 500 pages of textual body and several appendices providing more background. Part III, nonetheless, presents the most important and controversial findings. The authors recognise this, claiming, 'that many readers have turned first to this chapter indicates how sensitive the issue has become' (p. 270). It is difficult to accuse the authors of racist motives. Placing possibly controversial outcomes into a thought exercise, the authors state 'some people would interpret the news as a license for treating all whites as intellectually superior to all blacks [but it becomes] obvious how illogical [...] such reactions would be' (p. 312). It can, however, easily be said that the authors jump to conclusions about racial differences too soon, to go on suggesting changes in public policy in part IV.
