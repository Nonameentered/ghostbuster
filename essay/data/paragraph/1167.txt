Society sometimes perceives overweight people as lazy, blaming them for not having enough willpower to stick to a healthy regime. However, weight control can be an uphill struggle, not only to lose weight, but then also to maintain it. It is proposed that our genes may give us a predisposition to store fat reserves, as evolution has led us to have a natural drive to eat as much as possible when food is available. However, in today's society, where food is so plentiful, it is easy to over consume. There are many biological factors that contribute to weight regulation; homeostasis, certain brain structures, neurochemicals and metabolism have all been found to influence our weight. However, despite our genetic predispositions, it may be possible to overcome these biological factors through willpower.
