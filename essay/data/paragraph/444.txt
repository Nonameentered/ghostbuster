In brief, 100ul of the donor strain (XL1-Blue E. coli carrying F factor) was mixed with 200ul of the recipient strain (X590 E. coli). Four 0.2ml aliquots were taken and plated onto selective media at time intervals of 0, 15, 30 and 60 minutes. The use of selective plates prevented donor growth. Observations were made 48 hours after plating. All plates contained nalidixic acid (NA) to prevent further gene transfer in the samples.
