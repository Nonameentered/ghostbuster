To give this automatic read out of the torsion, it was decided that a torque cell should be implemented. A torque cell was a transducer and transducers were devices used for the measurement of a physical quantity by electrical means, i.e. used to convert non-electrical measurands into electrical quantities. They were used because this method often assisted subsequent operations on the data. In this case, the torque cell was converted an applied torque into an electrical output signal.
