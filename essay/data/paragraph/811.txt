The revised version of the Self Esteem Rating Scale was created to measure any difference between the control and experimental groups for self esteem regarding their new peer group by taking two questions from the SERS; two questions from the Social Avoidance and Distress scale (Watson, Friend and Rudolph, 2006), and four questions were written specifically for this study. On the experimental group only a t test between the revised measure and the control measure showed no significant difference between the groups. This suggests that the experimental group did not feel any more insecure with their "new friends" than the control group did with "others". The reliability for the revised measure was even higher than the SERS, suggesting that the addition of these specific questions produced reliable results. The Cronbach alpha for the revised measure was 0.82 and the Cronbach alpha for SERS was 0.76, showing the revised measure had a higher reliability in this study. When the results for the dependant variables were compared against the established normative means specified by
