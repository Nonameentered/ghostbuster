Beier and Finlay assert that 'people were pushed to London as well as pulled' As well as going to the city to better themselves, many were pushed there by poverty. The latter became increasingly common between 1500 and 1700, whereas in medieval period migration primarily involved reputable workers wanting to improve their situation by becoming apprentices in the guilds. Clark and Slack have argued that it was the poor and destitute who were seeking labour and charity that 'probably formed the bulk of the 8,000 or so net immigrants whom late Stuart London absorbed every year' This suggests that migration into early modern London was driven primarily by push factors.
