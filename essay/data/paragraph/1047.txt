There are however, cracks in the theory of over-riding economic concerns in British imperialism. Firstly, it must be said that possessions that paid off handsomely, such as India and South Africa, were extremely rare and were lacking amongst the possessions of the other colonial powers. Hence 'with few exceptions, colonial trade remained throughout this period an insignificant proportion of metropolitan commerce...' Instead, most of Europe's long-term overseas investment went significantly to areas outside of the formal colonial empires: French capital went into Russian bonds, German to Austria-Hungary and British to Latin America (in particular Argentina) and the other white-settlement former colonies (Canada and Australia). Moreover, very few colonies were actually profit-making entities, with the Germans colonising large areas of the African desert, and French indo-china being incomparable to the economically viable British colonies in the region.
