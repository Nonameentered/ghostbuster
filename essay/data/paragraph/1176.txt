Motivation can influence what a person consumes, however overcoming cravings can be a fundamental problem for people trying to lose weight and is commonly where willpower fails. A substantial number of obese individuals have indicated that their inability to lose weight resulted from excessive snacking due to cravings for sweets (Schlundt, Virts, Sbrocco, Pope-Cordle & Hill, 1993). A direct link between overeating and decreased serotonin levels, (Wurtman & Wurtman, 1981) has suggested that these cravings could be due to a drop in serotonin levels in the brain.
