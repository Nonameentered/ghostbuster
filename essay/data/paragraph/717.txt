There are other features of Lombroso's theory on criminality that Wilde has manipulated in The Portrait of Dorian Gray. For instance, Lombroso commented on the often cold nature of criminals towards their kin as 'their moral sense is sterile because it is suffocated by passions and the deadening force of habit' Whilst Dorian Gray's family are only revealed through portraits that he studies, he seems to blame them for his condition- not only displaying some hostility towards them but making an acknowledgement of hereditary degeneration. For example, he says of Philip Herbert's portrait: 'Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body to body till it had reached his own?' 'Wine-dashed' also implies that his mother was an alcoholic, another disease associated with the concept of degeneration. All his observations imply a sense of pre-disposition akin to the thoughts of Lombroso, and resentment towards such inheritance concurring with his beliefs as well. In terms of moral sterility Dorian Gray shows no remorse for his role in Sybil Vane's suicide, to which Basil comments 'I don't know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you' Also, not only does he murder Basil but deals with his death in a methodical manner- summoning Alan Campbell to dispose of the body, and systematically burning all remaining evidence- and describes after the event that 'he felt strangely calm' Equally when Campbell subsequently commits suicide Gray accepts no responsibility for causing another death. It is only when Gray eventually admits to himself the devastating effects he appears to have on all that he meets that he begins to be troubled by his actions, breaking with Lombrosian theory.
