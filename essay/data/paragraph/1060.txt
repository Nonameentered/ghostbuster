Perhaps, the most significant way in which the Enlightenment contributed to the Revolution was that it created a climate of change that was conducive for the revolution to occur. The overall rise in literacy, from 29 to 47 per cent for Men between 1686-90 and 1786-90, and 14 to 27 per cent for women Large-scale diffusion of critical and denunciatory literature (not least in pornographic books targeting the royal family) transformed the representation of the monarchy in the minds of the French, and made them think of themselves as victims of a despotic monarch. Thus, in Roger Chartier's words, regardless of the intent of the 'philosophical books', it succeeded in producing an 'ideological erosion' that may have made the revolution inevitable. According to Darnton, even though the people did not call for a Revolution or foresee 1789, unconsciously however, they prepared for that event by 'desanctifying the symbols and deflating the myths that made the monarchy legitimate in the eyes of its subject." The increased criticisms of the established order (the Church and the Monarchy) may have therefore poisoned the mentality of the Public Opinion in France that eventually led to revolution. The Encyclopedie also aspired to embody 'the power to change men's common ways of thinking' so as to make a 'revolution...in the minds of men and the national character." Hence the fostering of the 'critical spirit' amongst the French was also an important consequence of the Enlightenment
