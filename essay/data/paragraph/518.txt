The study of growth kinetics is conducted in order to determine the process of bacterial growth in a closed culture. There are many ways in which the cell growth can be monitored, each slightly different in methodology and each producing slightly different sets of results. For example, the cell growth can be monitored by following the change in viable count, measuring biochemical changes within the sample, for example protein concentration or as we aimed to do, by measuring bacterial growth through the change in culture absorbance. In this way we aimed to follow the growth
