In conclusion, there are many factors which contribute to the increased incidence of Legionnaires' disease, however the primary cause is the increased need for large scale water storage systems which due to inadequate water treatment and poor maintenance, provide the perfect environment for the proliferation of pathogens. The subsequent colonisation of amoebae increases the virulence of the organism and aids transmission of an infection by several means. Finally, the inability of many host immune systems to eradicate the infection or mount a significant response to clear the infection allows the bacteria to multiply without significant health risks to the host.
