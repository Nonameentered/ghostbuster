Overall the rise of medicine as a profession had many implications for women. It excluded them from the practice, an occupation which had previously been female, a result which had many further implications for women in both gender and class terms. It resulted in the redefining of women, into inherently dangerous, yet fragile human beings, who were therefore dependant upon men, and the male medical profession, as well as having a negative affect on women patients, as many did not wish to see male doctors. It also removed one of the final areas of society from which women could gain status, ensuring that men now acquired this standing, as well as excluding working-class women from treatment as they could no longer afford it, increasing the divisions between women of different classes.
