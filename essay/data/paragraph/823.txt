When the dependant variables were correlated it was apparent that there was a medium to high level correlation between the scores for EAT and SERS for the experimental group, although not for the control group. This shows that high deviant eating behaviour correlates more strongly with low self esteem for the experimental group. It appears that this may be a contributing factor as to why the first year students have more deviant eating behaviours than the control group, although it cannot be seen as a significant factor without further research into the role low self-esteem plays in disordered eating.
