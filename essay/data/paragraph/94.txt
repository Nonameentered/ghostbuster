The book sets out in an ambitious tone. In its introductory note, the authors forebode sensational conclusions, expecting 'that many people will have a "This can't possibly be true" reaction' (p. xix). It soon becomes clear that the book is intended for a wide audience, and throughout the book the authors continually insinuate this presumption. It is a point that is well worth noting, as we shall later see. The intention of the book, however, is not very clear at the outset. Vague notions such as 'for the last thirty years, the concept of intelligence has been the pariah in the world of ideas' (p. 1), and further, 'received wisdom in the media is roughly 180 degrees opposite from each of the six points [that we assume as a basis]' (p. 23) leave the reader with the idea that the authors are to set straight a grave misunderstanding.
