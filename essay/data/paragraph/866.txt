Research on group decision making outside the realm of juries has shown that whilst deliberating in a group, people tend to polarize towards the given majority (Myers and Kaplan, 1976). If this assumption were to be applied to jury deliberation processes, a social decision scheme would emerge that would predict that the final verdict would be the verdict of which the majority support. This however is not an accurate assessment of the jury deliberation process however and has been shown not to be a successful predictive matrix (Davis et al, 1977). The main reason for this is that juries have to consider the evidence with a criteria for conviction "beyond all reasonable doubt". It is proposed by MacCoun and Kerr (1988) that this produces a leniency bias in jury deliberations which must be accounted for by any accurate social decision scheme. This shows that jury deliberation is far more complex than simple polarization as it was even found by Tanford and Penrod (1986) (as cited in MacCoun and Kerr, 1988), that even when there is an initial majority favouring of conviction, a not guilty verdict can still prevail.
