Having children also carries a great deal of social capital in the form of respect and admiration from other members of society. It is argued that women gain respect from other generations in the extended family, leading to a sense of fulfilment which comes through being important to these other generations (Andorka, 1978). This links closely with Coldwell's idea, mentioned before, of children being a source of unique pleasure, as mothers can return to the status of being respected as someone's daughter as well as respected as a mother.
