The prehistory of the Solidarity movement was, most importantly, sparked by an increasing crystallisation of a "class consciousness" within the ranks of the Polish work force, many of whom were becoming convinced 'that they [could only] improve their lot collectively'. While official policy claimed to pursue a policy of egalitarianism, the reality behind these claims was only limited. The producing classes, those of the workers and peasants, found themselves on the same position in the material hierarchy as before, while a decrease in real standards of living were initially concealed only by the relative success of social mobility.
