This rise of medicine has had many implications for women; in this essay I will discuss them. The most important, both in terms of gender and class, was the exclusion of women from what had previously been a female occupation, and their confinement into inferior areas of medicine. However I will also examine the effects the rise of the profession of medicine had on women in relation to how women were viewed from the nineteenth century onward, and also the practical impacts that it had upon women receiving treatment, especially in the case of childbirth. In terms of class I will look at how working-class women received different treatments, as a result of the rise of medicine as a profession, and also how, consequently, the divisions between working-class and upper-class women increased.
