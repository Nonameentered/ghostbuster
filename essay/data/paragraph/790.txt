London was the legal centre of the country. The four Inns of Court, which were like England's third university, experienced a five-fold increase in admissions between 1550 and 1650. During term time there were around 1,000 students populating the capital. The Inns also employed many staff such as ushers, agents and scribes. The judicial centre of the country was Westminster, which observed a huge expansion in legal business in the sixteenth century. The land market expanded as church land was seized after the Reformation. This generated much legal business as the land was fought over. Women also engaged in legal business which brought them to London. They brought cases such as defamation, sexual offences and marriage disputes. This was a pull factor that drove migrants to the capital.
