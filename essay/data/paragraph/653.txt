To conclude, I initially looked at the similarities and dissimilarities between Marx and Habermas, and although many likenesses are apparent in Habermas's work, such as his use of key concepts and emancipatory theme, I would not go as far to label him a Marxist. Instead Habermas resides firmly in the Marxist revisionist camp, 'abandoning or relegating' certain Marxist principles. (Outhwaite, 1994; 4). As a means of emancipation the ideal speech situation does appear to have some merit such as the idea of using culture to force through change. And if considered as a (very) long term solution this suggestion does seem more practical than I originally thought. However, as a realistic emancipation from the kind of all encompassing, universal ideology legitimating not only the continuation of technological capitalism but also the depoliticisation of the population, I think it falls short. As Tugendhat points out; the idea that freedom is simply a matter of ideal speech in the right situation is problematic in itself, even despite the further problems such as its circular tendencies of reproducing delusions already held, and the impracticalities of all people having access to the right kind of situation. To finally answer the question, it seems that Habermas, although still within the broad Marxian trend is more a Marxist revisionist than a strict follower of Marx. Habermas's ideal speech situation does seem plausible in some cases; it seems as though it could work to emancipate However when posed as a means of freedom from the kind of ideology Habermas identifies, it seems less convincing.
