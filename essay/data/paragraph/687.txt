When trying to explain these results it is necessary to look at the raw data (appendix iii) and the responses given. In terms of errors made the original responses showed that participants during the no noise condition were able to remember a mean number of 8.7 words, as predicted by the seven items plus or minus two rule, (Miller, 1956), and this can be seen from the raw data, as most participants recalled between seven and nine words. It was also noted during the study that most subjects during this condition finished recalling words before the five minutes allowed, that is they were able to access their short term memory quickly and easily. Interestingly, in the unrelated condition the same was noticed; most subjects recalled as many as they could before the five minute boundary and appeared to be able to access the words quickly. In the related condition, however, participants often used the entire five minutes to recall words slowly. Many of these subjects recalled up to fifteen words, but many of these were words from the audio list (over headphones). In the other conditions hardly any words were remembered from the auditory source. These findings suggest that the semantically related words confused the subject and made it harder to concentrate on the written list only. The recollection of non-printed words suggests that many audio words were encoded at the same time, displacing the written words from short term storage.
