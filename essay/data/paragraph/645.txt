As an introduction to the essay question posed a very brief and simplified summary of Habermas's main ideas and theories seems appropriate. Habermas argued that from the late nineteenth century science, technology and industry became interdependent forming a new kind of capitalism. Habermas viewed this interdependence as meaning capitalist growth had no limits because science and technology were the new leading productive forces. This new form of capitalism used a different kind of production and allowed the '...biblical curse of necessary labour,' to be broken 'technologically'. (Habermas, 1970; 53). Originally capitalism had legitimated itself through economic notions of just exchange in the market, however due to the changes within capitalism, the exchange process itself now operated under political control. This new capitalism also required direct legitimation, this time using culture. Habermas argued that this led to a 'depoliticisation' of society, which was legitimated 'by having technology and science also take on the role of an ideology'. (Habermas, 1972; 104). A 'Technocratic consciousness' developed which affected everyone; not simply those repressed by the dominant. Habermas argued that there was no longer a lower class because everyone was now relatively rich. He argued there was no longer an exploited class, since technology was not dependent on labour; people were no longer forced to work, nor were they forcefully repressed in to their social positions. It is this universal, cultural phenomenon which Habermas's work focuses on and which replaces the Marxist questions of class conflict based on economic relations.
