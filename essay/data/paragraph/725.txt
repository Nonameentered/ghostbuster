As well as introducing new foodstuffs into the indigenous diet, the Columbian Exchange also reformed the role of existing items- most notably alcohol. In Pre-Colonial Latin America the main alcoholic beverage consumed was Drunkenness as a whole was frowned upon, but inebriation during times of celebration such as harvest, births, marriages and other religious ceremonies was considered a display of devotion; as Taylor notes 'alcohol, especially pulque, was associated with periodic, peaceful rituals that expressed village solidarity' However, colonisation introduced grape vines in a wider abundance, which increased the volume of wine available. Also, the Spanish introduced the technique of distillation and thus Indians had access to much stronger alcoholic beverages than they had experienced through the fermentation process. This wider range of alcoholic beverages not only increased access to alcohol, but also contributed to the secularisation of drunkenness, as the Spanish drunk on a daily basis in moderation and the new drinks were not closely linked to ritual as pulque was. The result of this was the prevalence of drunkenness on a more regular basis among Indians, and an increased involvement of alcohol into the regular indigenous diet as a whole. Colonialism led to the development of alcohol from a product consumed infrequently as part of ritual to a drink featured in the everyday lives of Latin Americans.
