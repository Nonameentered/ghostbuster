The mamillary bodies receive information from the hippocampus and are reciprocally connected to the anterior thalamic nucleus and the midbrain. These structures seem to play an important role in the memory process and have been described as 'a narrow funnel through which connections from the midbrain as well as the temporal lobe neo cortex and limbic system gain access to the frontal lobes.' (Mair et al., 1979).
