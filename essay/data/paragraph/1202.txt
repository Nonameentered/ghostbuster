Memory impairments are the most frequently reported symptoms of dementia (Maciejewski, 2001). As a result of their memory deficits, patients are unable to recall previously encountered objects and events and hence have difficulty in remembering to do tasks (McKeith et al, 1995). Memory impairment was found to be present in almost one half of all patients with mild AD (Read et al, 1998). One of the first results of memory impairment is an inability to remember new information, also known as anterograde memory (Korsakoff, 1889, as cited in Stokes & Holden, 1990). Maciejewski (2001) found that AD patients have particular difficulty in remembering to complete items on a list although they have retained some memory of the instructions, that is to say, AD does not erase already learned information but rather causes difficulty in transferring that information a few minutes later. This finding is in line with Grober and Sliwinski's (1991, as cited in Maciejewski, 2001) empirical work showing that AD patients are able to recall items on a list one or two items up or down the list, but are unable to recall items further along the list. However, their memory is not necessarily destroyed, as they are able to re-learn the items again, hinting at what is known as 'hard - head' forgetting.
