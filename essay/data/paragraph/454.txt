Threonine (trp) Arginine (arg) Isoleucine/Valine (ile/val) Leucine (leu) Proline (pro) Histidine (his)  This rough map of gene order shows that between 0 to 15 minutes the first two genes transferred from the donor were Threonine and Arginine, and from 15 to 30 minutes Isoleucine/Valine and Leucine were transferred. Proline and Histidine were transferred at least after 30 minutes and probably nearer the end of the time period.
