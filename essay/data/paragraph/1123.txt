The West, particularly the Germans, played a significant role in the growth of Chinese militarism in the late 19 This period marked the beginning of the 'New Military Schooling.' and in its quest for military supremacy, which ' represented another indication of the increasingly intense Chinese competition between the imperial ambitions of the Qing and the expanding Chinese assimilation of western weapons and military technology." This movement was mainly aimed at defending China against Western imperialism, and for the purpose, they sent army officers to study military science and artillery in Germany. Thus the military reform gave rise to a new anti-Western group: the Boxers who ' characteristically combined nationalism with millenarianism.' Their ideology was not too dissimilar to the Chinese Christian movement, in terms of their appeal for common people to overthrow the Manchus and restore the Ming by magical powers. The Boxers possessed significant military capability which saw them advance to the gates of Beijing, and brought Tientsin under siege.
