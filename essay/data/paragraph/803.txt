The present study is concerned with investigating the combination of both internal and external factors within a particularly vulnerable group of individuals, first year university students. Moving away from home for the first time is one of the most stressful life changes a person will ever have to adjust to (Seligman, Walker, Rosenhan, 2001). This study intends to investigate whether eating behaviours become more deviant during the first year of living away from home at university compared to a control group of non-university participants. Moving into halls of residence at university entails integration into a new peer group, which may heighten feelings of insecurity and low self esteem. It has already been shown that low self esteem is a significant contributor to disordered eating behaviour, and this may combine with students seeking the thin body ideal in order to successfully integrate with their new group of friends. When adolescent girls are beginning new friendships they believe it is important to be thin, and compare themselves to other members of the group (Guendouzi, 2004). Attainment of the thin body ideal was also found to be a common topic of conversation (Guendouzi, 2004). This is particularly important when investigating the effect integration of a new peer group has on eating behaviour as it is likely that when girls first start university and are making new friendships, this is a safe topic of conversation as body concerns an issue many girls have as a common ground, which may increase pressure to be thin.
