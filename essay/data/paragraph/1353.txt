The primary concern, in line with the works of Thorndike (1911) and Bandura (1973) is that viewed aggression leads to an increase in aggressive behaviour in children. Evidence shows links with both aggressive cognitions and actual behaviour. Huesmann and Eron's (1986) Prospective Study found children aged six to nine who watched a disproportionately large amount of aggressive material, including television programmes, films and cartoons, to grown into adults who experienced more interpersonal conflict and who believed there were more aggressive solutions to social problems. This study has been repeated in other countries with similar results (Hogan, 2000; Anderson and Bushman, 2001). It provides evidence of a causal relationship between viewed aggression and aggressive cognitions. Rice, Barbour and Prior-Palmieri (1998), conducted a study on the effects of exposure to television on school aged children. They found that children who watched a lot of television had attitude scores that were much higher than the national average. Such attitudes include believing that aggression is normal, and that it should be part of human life. However, some of the children's behaviour vis-Ã -vis aggression was not observed. Other studies have found that the effect sizes of aggressive cognitions were actually lower than expected, particularly when focusing on unstructured observaways (Drabman and Thomas, 1994). This implies that cognitions alone are not a reliable indicator of aggressive behaviour. Rather, the affective response to aggression and aggression in socially structured settings such as school or the home, are of far more importance (Coyne, Archer and Eslea, 2004; Jenkins, 1999). This implies that cognitions can not be taken too seriously when trying to measure how viewed aggression will manifest itself in behaviour.
