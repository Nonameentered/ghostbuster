Interestingly enough, subjects in both experiments displayed physical symptoms of their discomfort. Subjects of Milgram's experiment exhibited signs of extreme nervousness and started displaying sweating, trembling, stuttering, biting lips, groan and dug their fingernails into their flesh. Some subjects burst out in nervous laughter and three subjects had seizures. This sort of behaviour is comparable to those displayed in Zimbardo's subjects. In a bid to escape the mental torture and trauma they were in, four prisoners reacted by breaking down emotionally. One prisoner even developed a psychosomatic rash all over his entire body when he learned that his parole request had been turned down.
