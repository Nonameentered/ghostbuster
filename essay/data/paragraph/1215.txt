Despite the possibility of internal factors, such as, undeveloped memory, linguistics and schemas accounting for the childrens false reports (Bruck, et al., 1997), it has been reported that adults are far greater sources of distortion than any underlying cognitive deficit (McGough, 1996), and interviewer bias is extremely influential on children, producing numerous false reports (Goodman, et al, 1995). The case of Kelly Michaels was particularly ridden with inadequate interview procedures, including the repeated questioning of the same direct questions; a factor frequently associated with children's false reports (Quas & Schaaf, 2002; Ceci, et al., 1994, Bruck, at al., 2002). The source-monitoring framework states that the ability to remember the context in which an event occurred develops gradually with age (Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993) and in the absence of episodic memory (because the event did not occur); decisions are based on familiarity (Ruffman et al., 2002). Therefore, as a child has a limited source-monitoring capacity they will rely on familiarity to judge whether events actually occurred. In this case, as the children were re-asked questions immediately after giving an answer, the children may have assumed the initial answer was wrong and corrected it to please the interviewer, and continually providing this 'desirable' answer in repeated questions will ultimately increase familiarity. This is supported by research showing that children's responses can be influenced by contextual factors, particularly repeated questions and the perceived omniscience of an interviewer (Lewis,al. 1995). Consequently, suggestibility is more likely to be attributed to an interaction between internal and external factors, as it appears the interaction between repeated questioning and inadequate source-monitoring can result in false reports.
