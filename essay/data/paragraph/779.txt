After looking at all the evidence for evolution, Darwin speculated that 'probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form' This concept has been alluded to in the writings of some of the Romantics. For example, in his "Ode to the West Wind", Percy Shelley writes: 'The sapless foliage of the ocean, know / Thy voice, and suddenly grow grey, with fear' The plants of the sea respond in the same way to the changing seasons brought on by the west wind as the plants on the land. This is a 'typically Romantic image of sympathetic interactions across... boundaries' It is implied that sea plants and land plants behave in similar ways because they have a common origin. The Romantics were not evolutionary thinkers, but their view of nature was similar to Darwin's in the way that they could see 'one grand natural system'
