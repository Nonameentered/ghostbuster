Beside William Whiteley's London store, several other importers and shop-keeper in the 1870's came to open exclusive department stores, such as the Oxford Street's Army and Navy Co-operative society (Rappaport 1996). Also, in many smaller towns new shops opening in the last decades of the nineteenth century adopted the look of the large department stores, with merchandise advertised in window displays and various seasonal sales (Rappaport 1996, McCracken 1990). Shopping itself also was radically changing. The viewer's relation with the goods was altered from a tactile self-sampling to a passive ocular manipulation (McCracken 1990:14). Indeed, since the middle classes were suspicious of transactions with servants as well as being disgusted with haggling, the new stores solved this problem of shame. The shop assistant was quickly becoming an aloof, albeit helpful, 'guide and confidante' who, as Rappaport describes it, 'moved consumers without protest, physical or verbal, through the transgression of buying' (Rappaport 1996:91). Middle class customers could walk through the store unaccompanied, just to get on about their 'rational' shopping experience (McCracken 1990).
