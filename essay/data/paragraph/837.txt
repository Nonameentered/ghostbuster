Another cause for a child being unpopular is associated with the family (Henggeler, Edwards, Cohen and Summerville, 1991). The majority of children spend their first few years learning from their parents so it is not surprising that these early years contribute to the child's personality and whether they become popular or unpopular. Ainsworth and Wittig (1969) (as cited in Henggeler et al, 1991) investigated types of attachment between mother and infant. They identified three types of attachment as these have been investigated with regards to child's future popularity. Vandell and Wilson (1987) (as cited in Henggeler et al 1991) found that children who are securely attached become more popular than those who are not securely attached and have more positive peer interactions. This is likely to be because these children have a secure base from which to explore from and feel confident in themselves to make social advances, knowing that they have support. This inner feeling of security may facilitate confidence and an interpersonal family may produce interactional skills.
