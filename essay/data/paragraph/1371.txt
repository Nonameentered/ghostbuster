Using P = V.I , we can obtain a current value for a tolerance 748.5V voltage as being 1100A, which sounds about right for a tram of this sort. To completely traverse the frame of the pantograph,, we will need not more than 3m of cable. Because we want to keep losses to a minimum, we want no more than 0.2% voltage drop and to keep the motor within tolerances. Using R = V/I , this equated to a resistance of 0.013 To test this I have used a simple circuit with a potential divider to calculate V
