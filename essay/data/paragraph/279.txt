The debate between Ralph Miliband and Nicos Poulantzas reveals that a clear distinction exists between social structure and individual action. By debating the importance of either structure or action, these two Marxist writers reveal that having an ontology is necessary as there can be no one unified theory of society, as social reality itself is not unified (Craib, 1997; 269). Ralph Miliband adopts an Individualist approach to answering the question 'who is the Ruling Class?' in his book Due to his ontology Miliband investigates the specific members of the 'Ruling Class' and how they are connected to each other; he concludes that the 'Ruling Class' is constituted of individuals who share a common cultural background (such as attending the same schools) and the common interest of reproducing the capitalist system (as they benefit from it) (Miliband, 1973; 254-259). Alternatively, Poulantzas answers the question form a Collectivist perspective. He emphasises the importance of state institutions that persist regardless of the individual occupying them, and that individuals merely fulfil the 'role requirements' of their position within the capitalist system (Poulantzas, 1973; 242-245). Although these perspectives were presented as oppositional, I considered the merits of each to be complimentary. Neither satisfactorily dismissed the evidence of the other, and the possibility that both interpretations of the 'Ruling Class' could be correct (if reconciled) emerged. Therefore, I was encouraged to believe that there were two distinct strata of the 'Ruling Class', which could not be reduced to each other (and this is one of the central tenets of Realism). In light of this, the premises of Individualism and Collectivism needed to be evaluated.
