The Endosymbiotic Theory states that eukaryotic organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, evolved from prokaryotic cells that were engulfed by larger eukaryotic cells. According to Lynn Margulis, the main proponent of the theory, the organelles were originally free-living prokaryotes that lived in a mutually beneficial relationship with the host cell. The theory, first proposed in 1967, suggests that the engulfed bacteria gave the host cell a form of aerobic respiration for the generation of energy, creating the mitochondria, and allowed them to practice photosynthesis, thus creating chloroplasts. The idea was initially controversial and was met with a great deal of skepticism from the scientific community. However, with the advent of new technologies, such as electron microscopy and molecular techniques such as molecular phylogeny, more and more evidence has been found to support the endosymbiotic theory.
After considering the ecological and physical restraints found within the eukaryotic cells of organelles, Lynn Margulis proposed her endosymbiotic theory in 1967. The theory states that some organelles found in the eukaryotic cells were once free-living prokaryotes that were taken up by a larger host cell, called the endosymbiont (Figure 1). The position by Margulis states that the engulfed bacteria could have formed mutualistic associations with the host cell and with each other, resulting in a complex and beneficial relationship, which is co-evolution. This theory proposed that the organelles are descendants of free-living prokaryotes, mitochondrial fission and fusion, nuclear exclusion from cytokinesis, and gene transfer and exchange between the endosymbiont and the host cell were strong indications of their descent from prokaryotes. Furthermore, studies of the endocytosed bacteria’s physiology and ecology revealed that they were anaerobic predators or "facultative aerobes", which are either anaerobic or aerobic and are capable of living with or without oxygen. These prokaryotes might have become the ancestoral form for mitochondria and chloroplasts (Figure 2). The symbionts e ukaryotes had two powerful advantages over the free-living prokaryotes : they obtained oxygen and the increased surface area provided by the larger host cell endosymbiotic theory, this being the first of a proposed evolutionary event which lead to the rise of Eukaryotic cells.
The endosymbiotic theory of Margulis is the idea that prokaryotes, specifically bacteria, were engulfed by the ancestral eukaryotes resulting in the formation of organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. The theory also suggests that these organelles were then maintained endogenously in a mutualistic relationship with their host The theory was first postulated by Lynn Margulis in 1967 as, "organisms that evolved from different and distinct units by symbiogenesis within a larger organism and developed a permanent association." 6 This was a bold hypothesis, which was initially frowned upon by most scientists, especially when Margulis suggested that the prokaryotes were miniscule strands of DNA derived from the primitive eukaryotes' cytoplasm.  The theory states that in certain apical eukaryotes, the bacterial endosymbiont took up nutrients and provided its host with energy in the form of ATP by anaerobic respiration or photosynthesis. Furthermore, their interaction also resulted in an increased cell efficiency and complexity, leading to the emergence of novel eukaryotic cell structures such as those requiring oxygen which are not found in other organisms.
The mitochondria was the first symbiotic event during the prokaryote-eukaryote transition and this is why they are considered as the first organelle to evolve from prokaryotes, by endosymbiotic theory. Chloroplast and hydrogenosomes, however, are thought to arise from further serial endosymbiosis, for example, mitochondria-containing eukaryotes engulfed photosynthesising prokaryotes to become chloroplast containing protoctists, and anaerobic protoctists acquired fermentative prokaryotes, to become hydrogenosomes containing anaerobes
Mitochondria (Figure 4) are like a cell within a cell and can be divided into five compartments: matrix, inter-membrane space, inner membrane cristae, outer membrane, and nucleoid. This organelle is made up of four compartments, involved in the production of ATP from glucose The inner membrane contains a network of infoldings called cristae, in which the electron transport chain, the electron transport proteins and ATP synthase are located The matrix contains enzymes for oxaloacetate synthesis and enzymes involved in the Krebs cycle The outer membrane is freely permeable to small molecules, which enables the ATP to leave the mitochondria The inter-membrane space connects the inner and the outer membrane, where the molecules needed for the electron transport chain and Krebs cycle can pass through. The evidence suggests that mitochondrion is the byproduct of endosymbiosis of an anaerobic eubacterium by an ancestral anaerobic eukaryote. In addition, the mitochondrion generates energy in the form of ATP via electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation
Chloroplasts (Figure 5) are green coloured, photosynthetic organelle found in plant and algae cells They are double-membrane bound organelle, similarly to mitochondria and they are larger and have different shapes from each other Chloroplasts also lack sterols and are usually large in size (1–5µm) They house their own DNA and their own ribosomes, similarly to mitochondria and hydrogenosomes The chloroplasts contain thylakoid membrane system, which is involved in the primary photochemical processes of plant cells, in the biochemical conversion of light energy into chemical energy via photosynthesis
Evidence for the Endosymbiotic Theory
Mitochondria, chloroplast and hydrogenosomes contain own DNA1 (deoxyribonucleic acid)
The endosymbiotic theory proposes that the ancestor of mitochondria, chloroplasts and hydrogenosomes originated from the endocytosis of aerobic prokaryotes by anaerobic eukaryotes. This theory was first proposed by one of the great evolutionary biologists of all time, Dr. Lynn Margulis. The idea behind the endosymbiotic theory is that the organelles had their own DNA, which was introduced into the host eukaryotic cell, which then formed an endosymbiotic relationship. This led to the formation of larger and more complex cells, rather than the smaller simpler prokaryotes. This happens due to the combination of the different abilities of the symbionts and the host cell, making them more efficient and adaptive than either of the two on their own The two main components of the endosymbiotic theory is that firstly, the organelles arose from aerobic prokaryotic cells which were taken into the host eukaryotic cells and secondly, the host eukaryotic cells and the endocytosed bacteria became mutually dependent of each other due to a beneficial relationship.  The evidence that most closely supports the endosymbiotic theory includes molecular information about the origin of the organelles, gene transfer, molecular phylogeny, antibiotic specificity, double membrane structure and the evidence from amoebas.
Evidence of endosymbiosis1 Gene transfer from engulfed bacteria to host eukaryotic cells1
Despite the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, genes encoding for some of the proteins of these symbionts are found in the eukaryotic nucleus. Some of these genes are transcribed and translated in the cell nucleus, and then the final products are transported to the symbionts In addition, some of the bacterial-derived nuclear genes have adapted in the platting of alternate pathways, or alternative modes of energy production in eukaryotic cells This gene transfer between the prokaryotes and the host eukaryotic cell is known as lateral gene transfer
Ribosomal structure and size1
Chloroplasts and mitochondria have their own ribosomes which are highly similar in size to, and in some cases, even smaller than the prokaryotic ribosomes. However, their ribosomes are distinct from the ribosomes present in the cytosol of eukaryotes. Ribosomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts differ from other cellular ribosomes due to their ability to produce proteins using their own proteins and unpolarly transferred tRNA molecules Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of mitochondria and chloroplasts are more closely related to the bacterial rRNA in sequence and contains some sequences similar to Archaea rRNA These features strongly suggest that mitochondria and chloroplasts have descended from free-living bacteria and archaea, which have been endocytosed by a eukaryotic host cell Mitochondrial and chloroplast ribosomes are sensitive to antibiotics, which inhibit bacterial ribosomes; for example, linear erythromycin interferes with ribosomal protein translation, but not in the cytosolic systems
Antibiotic sensitivity in transcription and translation1
Another piece of evidence used to support the endosymbiotic theory is the selective antibiotic sensitivity of the endosymbiotically derived organelles Unlike eukaryotic cells, mitochondria and chloroplasts are seen to be resistant to the majority antibiotics due to the lack of sterols in their cytoplasmic membrane and the antibiotics sensitivity in protein synthesis Another study also showed, through the addition and withdrawal of various different antibiotics, that mitochondria undergo binary fission in response to toxins from the same antibiotics, which were used to which was used to kill off the host eukaryotic cells Therefore, the mitochondria are selectively sensitive to certain antibiotics that were also known to affect prokaryotic cells, whereas the cytoplasm of the eukaryotic cell is relatively insensitive to these same antibiotics Mitochondria and chloroplasts contain respiratory enzymes When comparing mitochondria to prokaryotic cells, some of the enzyme systems which are present in prokaryotic cells, such as NADH dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidases are also found in mitochondria. Furthermore, these enzyme systems are not present in the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm, suggesting that they were indeed derived from a prokaryotic bacterium which was more complex than it was previously thought This also applies for Chloroplasts. Chloroplasts share similar metabolic pathways as found in cyanobacteria, such as the Calvin-Benson cycle, which is responsible for the fixation of carbon dioxide to form sugars in photosynthesis, and various electron transport pathways
Part of the endosymbiotic theory states that the eukaryotic undulipodia, which is the eukaryotic motility organelles: flagella and cilia may have arisen from endosymbiotic spirochete bacteria Both cilia and flagella are made of microtubules and they are involved in mobility of the cells, for example in sperms or in moving fluid past the cells: ciliated epithelial cells that line our air passages and move a film of mucus towards the throat The basal bodies from which eukaryotic cilia and flagella develop would have been able to create the mitotic spindle, is therefore involved in mitosis. Cilia have many short microtubules and flagella have very long microtubules. Their movement is created as the microtubules slide past one another and the energy for this movement comes from ATP These undulipodia are made up of a cylindrical array of 9 evenly spaced microtubules, with motor molecules of dynein linking the adjacent microtubules together. The microtubules consist of several closely related proteins called tubulins As these whip-like undulipodia are common in eukaryotes but are not found in prokaryotes they are thought to have derived from still another group of free-living bacteria, the modern spirochetes This is, however the most controversial and most argued past of the endosymbiotic theory. According to Margulis, the undulipodia may be derived from bacteria through motility symbioses and this suggestion was referred to as the exogenous hypothesis. Even though the details of the argument are complicated the evidence supporting this hypothesis lies in the biology of the organelles themselves, their distribution, and the occurrence of related and analogous structures. On the other hand, another suggestion proposed that undulipodia originated internally as an extension of the microtubules, which are involved in mitosis, in a hypothesis referred as direct filiation or endogenous hypothesis, which is the non-symbiotic view of evolution that emphasises the role of various types of mutations in the evolutionary separation of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells
A phylogenetic tree or a molecular clock, based on the comparison of rRNA, or Ribosomal Ribonucleic Acid, of prokaryotes and organelles were studied and the results showed that the rRNA between these organisms were more alike than the between the eukaryotes and prokaryotes, implying they shared a common ancestor in the past There is further evidence, such as the detection of trans-spliced introns, in the organellar genome, which are present in eukaryotes but not prokaryotes. Mitochondrial introns have been detected in molluscs and Insects, both of which are distant relatives; this suggest that introns have been present, and have been passed down, throughout evolution
In conclusion, the evidence provided above clearly explains the endosymbiotic theory, which is the origin of the eukaryotic organelles; mitochondrion, chloroplast and hydrogenosome from endocytosis of free-living bacteria. Although the origin of undulipodia is still being disputed, evidence supports that at least two bacteria were symbiotically incorporated into the first eukaryotic cell; one for energy and the other for propulsion Furthermore, the evidence stated above suggests that symbionts in the eukaryotic cells are not merely vestigial organelles but have their own genetic material, ribosomes and specialised membrane systems which give them the characteristic of a free-living cell. This is supported by the fact that both mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA and ribosomes and they show sensitivity to antibiotics that affect only the prokaryotes From this process, modern eukaryotes gave rise to the evolution of most of the organisms living today, including bacteria, plants and animals. Thus, it is without a doubt that the endosymbiotic theory is the most accepted theory of the origin of eukaryotic organelles.
The double-membrane structure and genetic evidence in present-day mitochondria and chloroplasts are very convincing arguments supporting the endosymbiotic theory As these organelles are surrounded by two membranes, the outer membrane is akin to the Gram-negative bacteria and the inner membrane is somewhat similar to the Gram-positive bacteria. This double membrane formation (Figure 4) can be explained by the endosymbiotic theory that a eukaryote engulfed one or more Gram-negative bacteria (others propose a Gram-positive) which later became surrounded by a second membrane (forming the inner membrane) to give some protection and maintained their size and shape as the eukaryotic membrane began to form the outer membrane
Reduced genome size The genome of the original symbiont reduces over time, as it transfers gene information to the nucleus of the host cell This transfer of the gene is a major confirmation of the endosymbiotic theory, as this gradual shift in the gene content of the bacteria is seen in many different organelles compared to related free-living bacterial genomes, and another major characteristic that supports the endosymbiotic theory is the close similarity of presequence from the organellar DNA to those present in bacteria, although this similarity is not always conclusive evidence Furthermore, although the organellar DNA codes for some of the proteins, the majority are coded from the nuclear chromosome Passage of small substances The endosymbiotic relationships between the host and the organelles can be demonstrated by the transport of small substances The processes of protein and nucleic acid transport and many enzymes, such as ATP synthase, require the passage of small molecules, which are known to be mediated by specific transport proteins. The transport of small molecules is much greater in mitochondria, where most of the other enzymes are located The presence of porins is another confirmation of the endosymbiotic theory and is the ending of both internal and external membrane of the mitochondria and chloroplasts. Porin channel protein allows all molecules 100 Da to pass through them, which explains why ATP, for example, can pass through the internal membrane of mitochondria Other evidences, such as the presence of cardiolipin, which is a diphosphosphingolipid found only in mitochondria, support the endosymbiotic theory. Cardiolipin is not found in either the nuclear or the cytoplasmic membrane of eukaryotes, showing that, as mentioned earlier, the inner membrane of mitochondria is evolutionary very ancient. Other evidences The evolutionary trend which all photosynthetic organisms use within chloroplasts is known as the Z-scheme, which consists of two photochemical steps: The light dependent reaction and light independent reaction (The Calvin cycle). This type of photosynthetic electron transport chain, first found in cyanobacteria, is not present or used by any free-living bacteria, let alone any photosynthetic archaea, which is another supportive evidence for the endosymbiotic theory Additionally, a further similarity between mitochondria and chloroplast to their respective bacterial relatives is the use of F-ATP synthetase, which is present in prokaryotes, and comprises of F (FO) and V (V-ATPase) domains, but absent in the cytoplasmic part of eukaryotes. This again supports the idea of endosymbiosis
The term "endosymbiotic theory" was first coined by Lynn Margulis in 1967, when she proposed that both mitochondria and chloroplast in eukaryotic cells are descendants of aerobic bacteria which were endocytosed by anaerobic eukaryotes and were later on incorporated into the cell The essential points of her hypothesis are that free-living bacteria were engulfed by the primordial anaerobic eukaryotic cell, to form a mutually beneficial relationship, which led to the development of organelles, having their own nuclear DNAs and the ability to replicate independently of the eukaryote cell They may also have provided benefits to the host cell, such as ATP production via aerobic respiration and the production of oxygen, which is investigated further in the next section.
th century, Lynn Sagan provided an explantation on the origin of eukaryotic organelles called endosymbiotic theory. This proposed that the organelles in the cells, such as mitochondria, chloroplasts and possibly hydrogenosomes, resulted from anaerobic bacteria being engulfed (endocytosis) by a larger eukaryotic host cell and a mutual beneficial relationship eventually forming between them. The endosymbiont became specialized for its metabolic roles and was dependent on the host for its survival. Over time, the endosymbiont became incorporated into the host cell and the two became so dependent on each other that they could no longer function apart.  When first proposed, the endosymbiotic theory encountered immediate resistance; as it suggested that some of the organelles of eukaryotic cells were derived from microbes via endocytosis, which was at that time impossible. Furthermore, the rejection was because the concept of endosymbiosis defied the scale of conventional evolutionary thinking of species, with its insistence that important steps in the evolution of eukaryotes developed from within cells, rather than between species However, as the field of Molecular Biology advanced, more evidence in support of the endosymbiotic theory had been collected Inner organelles, such as the mitochondria are shaped like bacteria, with the same size, have a similar variety of enzymes, and even possess a circular DNA, like prokaryotes As photosynthetic organelles, chloroplasts also have several components, which are reminiscent of cyanobacteria, such as enzymes of photosynthesis, thylakoid membrane with chlorophyll and its kin, and the mechanism of the light reaction This ability to photosynthesise by chloroplasts is so important that it changed the Earth's atmosphere by converting it from anaerobic to oxygenated atmosphere and continues today, by driving the global carbon cycle  As photosynthesis is essential for the existence  Widespread among all eukaryotes, the number of flagella and cilia of eukaryotes, commonly referred to as undulipodia, were found to be distinct from bacterial flagella, which have helical filaments.
Controversies1
The origin of undulipodia, despite being fundamental for endosymbiotic theory, has yet to be resolved. There is heated debate between the endogenous and exogenous hypotheses for the origin of undulipodia. The endogenous hypothesis propose that microtubules were internalised to become the mitotic spindle, a cytoplasmic structure involved in mitosis, and were then adapted to become the undulipodia. The other half of the argument proposes that undulipodia were acquired endogenously through motility symbiosis, in which a bacterial partner provided the host eukaryote with an external motor for cell motility.
In summary, the endosymbiotic theory was proposed by Margulis in the late 1960s This theory proposes that mitochondria, a type of bacteria, are descended from aerobic prokaryotes that were endocytosed by a primordial eukaryotic cell similar to the modern amoeba, and that the chloroplast originated from cyanobacteria The theory is supported by the presence of similar organelle structures, bacterially derived genes in the nucleus, own ribosomes, antibiotic specificity of these organelles, molecular phylogeny and double membranes in the mitochondria and chloroplasts. Furthermore, the evidence that the eukaryotic motility organelles, flagella and cilia may have arisen from endosymbiotic spirochete bacteria adds strength to the argument
Summary:
In conclusion, the endosymbiotic theory is supported by a wide variety of evidence, both from molecular studies on eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and from observations of phylogenetics. The double membrane organisation of mitochondrial and chloroplastic organelles suggests that the origin of these organelles was associated with the engulfment of an exogenous prokaryote, followed by the permanent assimilation of the engulfed prokaryote without any cytoplasmic mixing. It is further supported by similarities in the morphology, structure, function, genetics, and phylogenetics of these organelles; the distinct possession of cytoplasmic and nuclear genes by both organelles, the presence of non-chromatophoric organelles such as hydrogenosomes and the requirement of oxygen from the environment, all of which are found only in eukaryotes. However, the origin of the eukaryotic undulipodia from endosymbiotic bacteria is still being disagreed upon, although it is fast becoming more accepted by molecular biologists.
The evidence above strongly suggests that organelles were arisen from the endosymbiotic uptake of free-living bacteria by eukaryotic host cells. As the host eukaryotic cell and symbionts developed a mutually beneficial existence, both entities lost their ability to function without the other, which would explain why neither mitochondria nor chloroplasts have been shown to be able to live on their own when isolated from the eukaryotic cell As Margulis and Sagan said one of their books, "Life did not take over the globe by combat, but by networking." 8
