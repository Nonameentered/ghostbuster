Archer shows that the flaws of collectivism stem from its inability to transcend empiricist concepts. Collectivism did not define the exact ontological status of 'societal properties' (as defined by Mendelbaum) (Archer, 1995; 49). This is because a societal property cannot be empirically proven as it does not have a tangible existence which can be directly detected by an individual's senses (Archer, 1995; 49). In addition to this, the empiricist concept of causation (whereby a phenomenon only has causal power if it produces constant conjunctions at an empirical level) denies social structures causal power, because they are neither observable nor causal in their effect (based upon this definition) (Archer, 1995; 52). Realism solves this problem as it recognises that society is an open system in which events are influenced by other contingencies, so the causal influence of emergent properties is not to consistently produce observable effects (Archer, 1995; 53). Therefore, collectivism could only challenge individualism methodologically (by showing that some features of society cannot be reduced to statements about individuals) but could not advance a counter-ontology (because of the dominance of empiricism) stating the existence of non-observable properties (Archer, 1995; 54). Realism, however, does not recognise the validity of the empiricist notion that all things which are held to exist must be detected through human sensory experience. The basic tenet of the realism advanced by Bhaskar and Archer is that society is stratified into individuals and the emergent, non-observable, social structure, and that these two non-reducible strata interact and influence each other (Archer, 1995; 61). After immanently critiquing individualism and collectivism, Archer then turned her attention towards refuting the ontology presented by 'elisionary theorising', represented by Giddens' 'structuration theory'.
