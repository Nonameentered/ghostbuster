This makes it very hard for sociologists to gain an understanding of the difference classes at this time. This shows how statistics can actually present a very one sided view of society, and the problems that arise from this (Hindess, 1973; Irvine and Miles, 1979) mean that the uses of official statistics in sociology are limited. To conclude sociologists should be careful when interpreting official statistics, and view them with caution. The internal school of thought claims that the main problems arise from the issues of reliability and validity, so say that if sociologists carefully considered the different definitions applied and the process of decision making they could present a more realistic picture of society.
