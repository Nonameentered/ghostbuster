In conclusion, it appears that age differences in selective attention are due to a variety of factors which also interact with each other. That is to say, age related slowing in general processing speed can have a knock-on effect on selective attention, as can an age-related decline in inhibitory/focal attentions capacity contribute to a greater susceptibility to distraction. All in all, these studies demonstrate that the cause of age-related deficits in selective attention could cause performance to differ in a variety of tasks (McDowd & Shaw, 2000).
