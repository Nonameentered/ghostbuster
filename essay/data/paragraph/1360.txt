The answer seems to be that awareness rather than concern is appropriate. Research does not suggest a clear link between viewed and displayed violence and aggression, therefore there is no need to be particularly worried at present. It does, however, highlight what to be aware of when embarking on this debate. Firstly, suitable parental control and the discouragement of violence can combat the imitation of aggression by children displayed on television and in films, in line with the theories of Bandura (1973) and Thorndike (1911). Such theories should serve as warnings for the possible consequences of violence on television. Secondly, research demonstrates that aggressive images in the media and on television in particular can not be attributed to one cause - socio-economic, biological and familial influences must be considered first and foremost, not to mention proposed sex differences. Lastly, public opinion and inconclusive research can tend to distort the issue, and not give due attention to the influences of real life on the behaviour of children (Bushman and Anderson, 2001). Public health reports suggest multidisciplinary approaches to research, incorporating neuroscience, sociology, child development and economics (Brown and Cantor, 2002), can establish a clearer state of events.
