In conclusion, it has been suggested that there were both topical and structural flaws with the concept of 'charismatic rule. Legitimacy of the Third Reich was obtained not from established institutions, but rather, from a man, and his myth. The power of the Fuhrer was however conditional on success-unless rewards were reaped from his leadership, the mandate could be taken as passing away from the Fuhrer. The close association of the Fuhrer-myth with the state meant that unlike Stalin, Hitler was unable to escape the failure and blame for the decline of the state, and the result of this inability to pass responsibility was a 'serious meltdown' in the popularity of the Fuhrer. The resulting crisis issued the 'final combat order', which sealed the fate of the Reich. The chaotic state bureaucracy, the collapse of authority when Hitler dies, and the pre-occupation of Hitler with his own destiny all contributed to the weakening of the Nazi dictatorship. Thus, it can be contended that Hitler's 'charismatic rule' was an embattled concept of legitimacy, reflecting both the strength and the weakness of the Third Reich.
