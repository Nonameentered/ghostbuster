By 1970, n increasing awareness of the existence of social class was observed in Polish society. This classification was not so much based upon political affiliation as upon material wealth. Rapid industrialisation since World War Two had brought new realities urban workers, a large number of them of young age, in a setting of narrowly confined economic possibilities. When rapid economic and industrial development began to slow down and the initial success story of social mobility began to lose its stretch, problems became observable. The popular official state narrative of egalitarianism became increasingly exposed, whereas the state had little means to provide alternative justifications. In a situation that was becoming more and more complicated, the workers soon discovered the power of strike and protest, something which the regime was rather fearful of. With no alternative means of political participation, the working class was rapidly becoming self-aware and radical, while the regime, with a large number of critical intellectuals torn between the rigor of party policy and the difficulty of reform, proved unable to control economic decline and the social outcry against party elitism and decadence. A state that claimed to hold the interests of workers as its highest principle was rapidly losing support from just that group. The strikers of Solidarity were no longer easily drawn back into the folds of socialist society which had, according to them, structurally failed to improve itself. A number of critical intellectuals, however, come to the aid of the workers. The KOR created effective means of communication between different workers' groups, and bridged the gap of solidarity between intellectuals and workers. Nonetheless, the development of Solidarity must be viewed as a broad expression of workers' grievances with the sympathy and support of a number of critical intellectuals.
