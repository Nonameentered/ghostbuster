Although this explanation is popular, there is still debate as to how much evidence the generalised-slowing hypothesis actually provides. It has been argued that the presence of an age-related decrement in large conjunctive tasks may indicate a presence of both task-specific deficits and generalised slowing (McDowd & Shaw, 2000). That is to say, if the age-related slowing is found on both the conjunction task and the feature tasks, then this could suggest general slowing, but if age-related slowing is only observed on the conjunction task, then this could point to a task-specific deficit.
