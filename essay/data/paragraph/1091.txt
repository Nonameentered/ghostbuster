China has long captured the imagination of the West, and still remains an enigma in this present age despite the vicissitudes of time. While technology now permits us to catch a glimpse of China on the news, on the internet, or plausibly, even visit China; this would not have been conceivable in previous centuries, where one of the few ways in which one could come into contact with, and conceive of China was through the objects brought back from overseas trade- which was itself stimulated by a thirst for the mysterious exotic Orient as much as it was for profit. Although these goods were prized for their scarcity, aesthetic value and excellent workmanship, it was not the material alone that captivated, but more importantly, it was the non-material associations that imbued the goods with meaning, desirability and the label of 'luxury'. This fuelled the luxury trade, long underpinned by traditional court luxury, which reached its zenith in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, with the establishment of the chartered East India companies and the subsequent creation of a European market for these goods. In short, it was through the acquisition of Chinese goods, which defined the 'Other', that one perceives the 'Self' in a clearer light.
