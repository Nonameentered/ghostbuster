This was allowed to proceed for 1.5hours and at 15 minute and 30 minute intervals, 2 ml samples of the mating mixture were removed and added to 5ml of saline to hinder further conjugation. The samples were then immediately plated on selective (contains nalidixic acid to work as counter selection to eliminate donor growth) and non-selective media to select for recombinants as well as noting growth of the donor and recipient strains on their own. The plates were incubated at 37 degrees Celsius for 24 hours and the appearance of growth was then noted. The results obtained were as follows:
