Although there were many problems (both discipline and doctrinal) that the Church faced, it is apparent that these problems had been in existence for the past one or two centuries, and that despite the criticisms, the aim of the reformers was not to subvert the church, but had in mind the desire to change the church into a more responsive, relevant and effective apparatus. Throughout the essay, the writer has tried to suggest that it was the rising expectations of a growing educated class (laity and clergy) and the inability of the church to keep up the pace of reform and to satisfy the needs of the laity - the disparity between expectations and reality- that led to disillusionment. Similarly, the high expectations that the Church set with regards to piety eventually led to the alienation of the people from the Church. Despite the deep-rooted flaws of the church, the attempts at reforming it suggest "men were seeking salvation and wished to find it with the help of the church." Hence, in trying to account for the Reformation, it is inadequate to merely examine what was 'wrong' with the church, but requires instead, a broader understanding of the climate and considerations (political, economic and social) of the Age.
