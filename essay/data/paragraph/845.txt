Human colour vision can most often be described as trichromatic. Having trichromatic colour vision entails having three types of wavelength specific cones in the retina, each of which are maximally responsive to short, medium or long wavelengths of light in the colour spectrum. Short, medium and long wavelength cones maximally respond to blue, green and red light respectively (Goldstein, 2002). Trichromacy is not a uniform feature of human physiology however. Because colour vision is inherited genetically, with medium and long wavelength specific genes being located on the x chromosome, mutations can occur. These mutations can cause a type of colour blindness called anomalous trichromacy, in which the red photopsin becomes slightly shifted (Sanocki, Shevell, Winderickx, 1993). If a woman inherits the three cones for normal trichromacy on one x chromosome, and the three cones for anomalous trichromacy on the other x chromosomes, she will possess two types of red photopsin and therefore have the possibility of four wavelength specific cones. If having four different wavelength specific cones defines tetrachromacy it is highly likely that there are tetrachromats (Jameson, Highnote and Wasserman, 2001). If, however, tetrachromacy is defined by the visual system acting upon this extra cone and creating the neural mechanisms to allow visual experience to be derived from it, then evidence for tetrachromacy is not so forthcoming (Jordan and Mollen, 1993). It is likely that even if the visual system can derive information from this extra cone containing the shifted red photopsin, this is not going to result in a considerably different visual experience to that of trichromats because the shifted red photopsin is only six nanometres (nm) away from the original red photopsin (Winderickx, Lindsey, Sanocki, Teller, Motulsky, Deeb,1992).
