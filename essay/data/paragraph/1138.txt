L-dopa (the precursor to dopamine) is administered to increase levels of dopamine in the brain in order to reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. L-dopa enhances dopamine levels of the surviving cells but because the cell bodies in the brain stem degenerate, dopamine-containing terminals also disappear. Eventually too few dopamine-containing neurons remain in the substantia nigra to be influenced by the intake of L-dopa (Biological Psychology, 2002, p.353). Therefore L-dopa only relieves the symptoms and because the degeneration of the substantia nigra is progressive, there is no cure as yet. Recent reports have suggested that a more permanent cure would be to transplant new dopamine neurons from embryonic brains (Principles Of Biopsychology, 2001, p.26).
