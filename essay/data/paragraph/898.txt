The Russian people made an incredible effort. It is clear that the morale of the people was paramount in the victory over Germany; something even Stalin recognised as he eventually allowed religious services to be held saying that it provided 'some kind of spiritual tonic' for the soldiers. However, this was a two way process. The government had to change their policies for the population to contribute to the war. There was much collaboration between the state and the people in order for the war to be won, and the people supported the government's drive to rearm and produced munitions. For example, both government and people co-operated to build the Baikal-Amur railway, which was essential for the war effort. It took a combined effort of both the people and the government in order for the Russian's to win the war.
