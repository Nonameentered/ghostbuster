In this essay it has been described why a sociologist must have a view about the nature of social reality. It was also discussed how the different manifestations of the 'Ruling Class' are representative of the stratified nature of social reality. The different methodologies and ontologies of Individualism and Collectivism were compared to show how Collectivism exposes Individualism's methodological flaws. However, it was then shown that that the ontological premise of Collectivism is not far reaching enough to persuade me to adopt its view of social reality. Finally, Realism was depicted as providing the ontological depth that the Collectivist approach lacks, in addition to its superiority over any other theory that also rejects (or purports to reject) the structure versus action dualism.
