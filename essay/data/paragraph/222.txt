Despite this loathing with politics, the middle class adopted the tango as an aspect of the new, dynamic and modern culture that Argentina was now adopting. In this, the cinema played a big, yet not unambiguous role. Argentina was steadily adopting the Northern American cinema culture. In 1930, around a thousand film screens could be found throughout the country. By the late thirties, fifty such films were produced a year, also serving as a charming and successful export product for other Latin American countries.
