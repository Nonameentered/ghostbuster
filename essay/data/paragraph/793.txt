Young women migrated to London as it was a place 'where the rigid controls of patriarchy... [were] more easily evaded' Single women could socialise and court more freely than in the smaller, more kin-based communities of the rest of the country. These women migrants often married later then the women from where they originated. They often worked and earned independently for a few years before marriage. The anonymity of the city allowed some women to start anew if their reputation had been damaged at home. This type of migration involved both push and pull factors as the women were escaping the restrictions of the smaller towns and countryside and were attracted by the freer lifestyle in London.
