Perhaps the greatest change in the New World diet came in the introduction of Old World meats to Latin America. Indigenous nutrition consisted of a predominantly vegetarian diet, although Crosby notes that 'the turkey and muscovy duck were certainly present in pre-Columbian America, and some think that a type of chicken was also' Livestock did not encounter the same degree of difficulty that occurred in introducing plants, as they were far more adaptable to the climactic conditions; in fact, their ability to settle and reproduce was so great that their expanding numbers quickly became a problem for natives, who found cattle inhabiting their land and destroying their crops. As Pilcher notes 'herds literally overran the countryside, driving Indians from their fields' However, this practical nuisance did not deter indigenous consumption. Initially, pork emerged as the first meat to be consumed in any quantity, but was soon superseded by beef. Cattle proved the most adaptable livestock to the different climactic conditions and successful breeding led to a dramatic drop in the price of meat- between 1532 and 1538 the price of beef in Latin America fell by seventy five percent. In fact, Pilcher claims that 'urban meat prices fell so low in the sixteenth century that ranchers slaughtered the animals for their hides and often left the carcasses to rot' As well as the nutritional value of meat itself, the increased availability of other animal products such as milk, cheese and eggs supplemented the level of protein in Indian diets. In fact, meat was incorporated so successfully into the American diet that in 1589 when the Viceroy of Peru advised a healthy diet in order to prevent disease, mutton, fowl and goat were three of the foods that he mentioned specifically. As Super concludes 'meat, a scarce commodity before the conquest, became commonplace in the nutritional regimes of Spaniards and Indians by the middle of the sixteenth century'
