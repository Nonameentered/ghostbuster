Qualitative research is associated with meanings and interpretation. It is not reliant upon numerical data as quantitative research is and focuses more upon the context in which behaviour is recorded. The reliability and validity of qualitative research has often been questioned as the analysis of its findings are often open to interpretation (Burman, 1994). Because of this it has previously been claimed that the method is not reliable or valid, although these two terms have always been defined in terms of quantitative research. It is possible that qualitative research is at least as reliable and valid as quantitative research when the definition of what is "reliable" and what is "valid" is altered to reflect the specialist nature of the qualitative method (Merrick, 1993).
