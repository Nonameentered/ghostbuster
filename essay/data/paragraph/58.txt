There were many reasons as to why unemployment grew in the 1980s and 1990s. The neo-liberal and social democratic approaches have opposing views, with the neo-liberals arguing that unemployment was down to individual attitudes, and that deregulating markets would solve this problem, whilst social democratic approaches argued that it was a structural problem, that regulated markets and welfare would lessen (Vickerstaff, 2003). However there were many more complicated factors involved in the steep decline during this period.
