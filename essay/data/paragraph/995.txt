In Convention Internal Combustion Engines (CI engines), fuel and air were mixed together in the combustion chamber and ignited by spark plug. Such engines use either gasoline or diesel as the fuel (including natural gas). The widely used gasoline engines were mainly consisted of Otto Cycle and the most common petrol engine type was SI engine. Types of Engines/Cycles In 1900s, various types of engines were invented such as diesel engine, rotary engine and Wankel engine (It got its name from its inventor Felix Wankel). Diesel engines used compression ignition, they were mainly used in large vehicles due to its unique features such as the higher compression ratio can provide high torque output and better fuel economy.  Rotary engines (Rotary combustion engines, RCE) were first developed by Felix Wankel. It was a type of combustion engine which was consists of rotor which is consist of three apex forming an equilateral triangle instead of a traditional pistons and a co-axial cylinder. It used mixture of air and fuel to run the engine but the operating principle was different from the conventional engine. RCEs could had advantages such as higher thermal efficiency, lighter and more compact design and lower nitrogen oxide emission.
