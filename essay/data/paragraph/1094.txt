The East India Companies (VOC and EIC) which were created at the start of the age of sail, coming at the confluence of two stores of thought-legal and economic, and the rise of maritime trade; were instrumental in creating the demand for Chinese luxury goods among the European upper classes. As the EICs were more successful, their profits increased, which enabled them to provide goods at prices within reach of the wealthier strata in Britain. Furthermore, the rising prosperity of the EICs also meant that the company directors and their ilk were better placed to afford these goods, or at least, to speculate in them. Conscious of the role that luxury goods plaid in the European court, the EICs were able to seize the opportunity to bring in Chinese luxury goods by leveraging their position as the sole legal trader on the European market. In addition to enhancing their trade monopoly, their lavish buying habits in China can be linked to their hope for greater trade by encouraging the Chinese to trade with them, as well as increase their credibility in the eyes of the Chinese. As can be seen, the EICs were in a privileged position for their successes in acquiring Chinese luxury goods was not only based on their purchasing power, but also because they had access to private collections in China that were not open to other Europeans.
