In automotive racing industry, only particular specifications were selected and employed since the efficiency could only be improved by such specifications. Different cylinder configurations such as single, in-line, v-type, w-type, u-type, opposed cylinder, opposed piston and radial could be found in IC engines. However, in-line and v-type were the most commonly used configurations in automotive racing engines. Further more, the common numbers of valves employed in each cylinder were 2 (1 intake, 1 exhaust), 4 (2 intake, 2 exhaust) and 5 (3 intake, 2 exhaust). Generally 4 valves were employed in racing engine.
