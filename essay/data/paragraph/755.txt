Burckhardt identified Florence as the 'cradle of the Renaissance' It appears as though 'the components for a successful intellectual movement were all to be found in Florence at the start of the fifteenth century' The city was wealthy, banking was highly developed, and papal revenues were often invested in Florence rather than the volatile and dangerous city of Rome. Florence had a high population. It was active in manufacture, trade and commerce. Textile production and metalworking were successful industries in Florence. The city was in a prime position for trade; it was close enough to the coast for sea trade but far enough to keep it safe from pirate attacks. It was also able to trade over the Alps and was close to the Middle East so merchants could bring back the luxury goods available there, such as silk and spices. Florence was primarily a city orientated towards craft-industrial production rather than trade like Venice. This appears to have been a more favourable environment for artists to be produced as 'it was only when Venice turned from trade to industry, at the end of the fifteenth century, that Venetian art caught up with that of Florence'
