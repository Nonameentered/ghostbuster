The friendship between the two thinkers resulted in a decisive influence on the development of Marxism. As revolutionaries, Marx and Engels argued that the emancipation of the working class should be achieved by a 'dictatorship of the proletariat'. This implied the single-party rule of a nationalist state authority, and is an aspect of Marxism-Leninism that has often been interpreted as undemocratic. The notion of a revolutionary state was to play a prominent role in the intellectual legacy of Marx and Engels, as became clear in the writings of Lenin and of fellow Bolsheviks.
