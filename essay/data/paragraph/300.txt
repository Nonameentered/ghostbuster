However, it has been argued recently that the development of critical realism represents a threat to the continual development of sociological theory (through the process of critical discussion), because "critical realists are engaged in an hegemonic project which seeks to conceptually re-tool the natural and social sciences" (Cruickshank, 2004; 567). Cruickshank is arguing that critical realists refuse to contribute to the ongoing critical dialogue about reality, and consequently if the critical realist ontology is accepted as the 'infallible' definition of reality, then sociology must necessarily sacrifice its inherently partial character and the diversity of sociological theories contingent upon it.
