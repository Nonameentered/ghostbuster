The most general conclusion which can be drawn from the MANOVA is that there was an overall significance between the experimental and control group on the three dependant variables; scores for EAT, BSQ and SERS. There was however only a significant main effect for EAT, which means that there was only a significant difference between the groups in their eating behaviour and not in their self-esteem levels or body shape dissatisfaction. When an independent samples t-test was conducted between the control and experimental group for the revised measure of SERS, where only questionnaires relating to the new peer group were included, there was still no significant difference between the two. This suggests that experimental participants had no more self esteem issues regarding their "new friends" than control participants had with "others".
