It is quite apparent that a significant rise in production occurred from October 1938 onwards. However, this source is fundamentally limited in understanding air strategy, as Spitfires were neither the archetypal fighter in 1938-9 nor accounted for the bulk of the fighter force. Hurricane production is also required, in order to obtain a true picture of any significant change in production, and ergo air strategy. The difference in orders was 8647 more Hurricanes (Appendix 4). Importantly, Figure 10 below shows that from June 1938 the number of all fighters being delivered rose feverishly.
