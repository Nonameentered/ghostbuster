Each one of Piaget's stages is intended to serve as a framework, which illustrates the principles, capabilities and constraints for the mind as the child matures. Each stage characterises the nature and progression of the child's development (Feldman, 2004). Piaget's pre-operational and concrete operational stages, which encompass the development of children in primary school, propose that the child becomes better at centration as they progress from the former stage to the latter - they are able to focus on an aspect of the situation to the exclusion of all others (Slater, Hocking and Loose, 2003). This, in turn, aids their ability to learn new ideas. With regard to scientific concepts, a body of research exists which implies that the understanding of different concepts can emerge at different times, based more on what the subject topic involves specifically, than the child's aptitude for knowledge in general as it matures. For example, Massey and Gelman (1988) showed that four year olds are aware of whether or not different types of animate and inanimate objects could move up a hill by themselves. However, Rosengren et al (1991), demonstrate that at four, but more at five years of age, children understand how animate objects grow as they mature, and how inanimate objects do not.
