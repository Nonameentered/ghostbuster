At its centre, questions concerning the limitations of conventional approaches to constructing social knowledge take form. Relevancy, in this case referring to the accepted manner of knowledge attribution, governs the social scientist's deduced ability to construct a satisfactory and meaningful account of the phenomena under consideration. The situation of such vast limitations inspires ethnomethodologists to 'fill in some of the gaps left by conventional decision-oriented sociology' (Cicourel 1973: 101) by looking more closely at the 'knowledgeability' of everyday actors (Garfinkel 1967). In doing so, not only does the individual become the locus of attention, but also does the way in which this individual then relates to others surrounding him or her by means of typification and interpretation of social variables and event, eventually forming a 'structure of meaningful interaction' (Silverman 1972: 170).
