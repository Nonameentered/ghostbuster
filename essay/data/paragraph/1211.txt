The actual relationship between the caregiver and the patient can also impose psychological effects on both parties. Tension often arises when there is a discrepancy between what the patient feels they need and what the caregiver wants (e.g. if they need a break). The nature of this can have a big effect on the caregiver's ability to cope, for example a close and intimate relationship can induce feelings of depression in the caregiver as well as an inability to communicate (Morris et al, 1988). This is further supported by the fact that if the relationship is close then the strain placed upon the caregiver is greater (Goudie, 1990)
