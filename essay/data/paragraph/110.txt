In the case of age, I observed two distinct phenomena by the use of the stairs. A person over forty years of age, for instance, usually went straight to the first floor. Younger people, aged between eighteen and thirty, would enter the shop undecided and shortly afterwards in most cases go straight downstairs. It was evident that older and younger customers often instinctively chose different regions of the store according to their age.
