Despite these advances, it was not until the twentieth century that midwifery became recognised as central to general practice (Moscucci, 1990), and qualifications were deemed necessary to practice of midwifery, with the 1902 Midwives Act (Oakley, 1984). This resulted in women being further pushed out of an area which they had continued to dominate, despite the professionalisation of the rest of medicine. This also had class implications, as although women were accepted by lying-in hospitals to train in midwifery they had to pay for the privilege, ensuring that it was only those from the skilled classes who could qualify (Donnison, 1993). Previously, midwifery had been based largely on experience rather than qualification, so was practiced by many working-class women.
