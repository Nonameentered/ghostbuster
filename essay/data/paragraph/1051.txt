Though it is extremely difficult to argue that cultural influences were the direct causes of European imperialism, it nevertheless 'assisted in creating the general circumstances within which specific instances of imperial domination...became for contemporaries, not only imaginable but acceptable." The consequences of cultural transfers are still seen in our modern world, where the colonies largely taken on the parliamentary model of their former colonial masters. This change has its roots in the era of colonisation where the indigenous political and often social hierarchy was replaced by the political institutions and protocol of the metropolis. The adoption of the colonial language as the working language, the western architecture of new buildings and the assimilation into the cash-economy, are all examples of the transfer of culture. Similarly, there were many ways in which the natives have inspired European art and lifestyle.
