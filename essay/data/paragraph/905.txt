The hippocampus is thought to be important for the formation of some emotional memories, in particular fearful ones (Lee, Winter, Green & Davidson, 1995, as cited in Eysenck & Keane, 2000). This was demonstrated by Cahill and McGaugh (1995, as cited in Eysenck & Keane, 2000) who trained animals using mild electric shocks and then administered an amnesic drug, scopolamine. They discovered that inhibition of the hippocampus led to a reduction in the emotional effects, in terms of both behaviour and conditioned physiological responses. Similarly, other researchers showed that impairment of the hippocampus reduced the emotional response in monkeys (O'Keefe, 1986, as cited in Eysenck & Keane, 2000). Thus there appears to be some evidence that fear can be encoded in the hippocampus and although it does not seem to be the sole structure involved, its involvement does indicate that emotion and memory are closely connected within the brain.
