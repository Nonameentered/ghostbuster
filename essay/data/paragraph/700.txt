Qualitative research obviously requires an analysis of non-numeric data and this analysis can take many forms. One of the main areas of research is naturalistic observation, where researchers watch behaviour in its natural environment, as opposed to an artificial, cluttered lab-based study. This has the advantage of being much more realistic, yet observation and coding of non-numeric data need careful analysis to ensure valid and reliable results. In this respect, the observations and recordings need to be natural and revisable. Note- taking, video recordings of events or video diaries have all been found to be useful in getting a valid and reliable qualitative picture, although all such methods have advantages and disadvantages to be aware of.
