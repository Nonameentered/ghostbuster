The purpose of this experiment is to explore the relationship between the forms of Newton's 2nd Law appropriate to linear motion and to rotational motion, explore the physical behaviour of 2nd moment of mass and to develop understanding of the nature of experimental error and the analysis of experiment data. At the end of the experiment, the moments of inertia of the three disc is determined and compared with the values derive using the theoretical relationship. An estimate of the precision and accuracy of the measurements will be made as well.
