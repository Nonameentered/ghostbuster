This laboratory activity was undertaken to investigate the isoelectric points of casein, haemoglobin and cytochrome c. By testing the reaction of these molecules in buffer solutions of varying pHs, we were able to determine the pH at which these molecules have a neutral charge.  In order to investigate the isoelectric points of casein, a series of buffers were created using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. This equation allows the pH of a buffer solution to be calculated from the pKa and the relative concentrations of the acidic and basic components. The equation states that:   pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])   Where [A-] is the concentration of the salt formed (the conjugate base) and [HA] is the concentration of the weak acid. In this experiment the conjugate base used was sodium acetate and the weak acid was acetic acid. The pK of acetic acid was also taken into account. The calculations and calculating the pH of each respective buffer are shown in section two of the appendix.  Once the buffer solutions had been prepared they were added to 1ml aliquots of a solution of casein (dissolved in 0.1M sodium acetate) in order to determine the isoelectric point of casein. From this we were able to use the spectrophotometer to measure the absorption of each respective buffer solution and from this the isoelectric point could be determined.
