The involvement of warfare does not just make possible annihiliations by providing the ideal climate for the birth of new regimes-as discussed in the paragraph above- but also by making it possible for genocide to be perpetrated on such a large scale as the perpetrator countries were able to utilise the plight of war to their advantage, and exercised their power against any governmentally identified threat. In both the Holocaust and Cambodian genocide the threat of war was used to raise the intensity of the regimes' power, as 'until 1941 the massive destruction... [of European Jewry] was carried out...while the Nazi policy of war was still directed mainly against Poland and other Eastern European countries, and not against Germany's enemies in the West' Similarly, in Cambodia, the target of the Pol Pot regime was never a foreign power, but rather its own population. War gave them the opportunity to exercise their power, and it also allowed other countries to turn a blind eye to the problem in the hope of appeasing an opposing power. This raises the example of the United Nations response to the Bosnian genocide. Many researchers argue that the UN was particularly slow in their response, and this could be partly attributed to the war between Serbia and Croatia. Germany and France also were unwilling to intervene, 'fearing the interruption of Yugoslavian trade' with Germany also 'alarmed by the possibility that military intervention would have on the elections looming in Germany at the time' The United Nations involvement in the Bosnian massacre, and the hesitance of other countries to become involved is a further similarities between all of the massacres of the twentieth century.
