The results of this study showed that first year university females do have significantly more disordered eating than a matched age control group of non-university females. Low self esteem and integrating a new peer group were not significant causes of this. It may be that low self esteem and having to integrate a new peer group might still play a part in increasing eating deviancy in first year students, although these may not have been shown to be significant because they combine with other factors associated with university life such as stress and depression. It is clear however that first year females have far more problems with their eating than females who are not at university.
