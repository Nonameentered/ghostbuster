The experiment was successful and accuracy of results obtained demonstrated the specificity of HA and HI assays. The known end points were observed and the virus was successfully identified. However, there were some limitations and source of errors. For regular dilutions, assumptions are made that the volume transferred of each dilution is accurate which is impossible to achieve due to precision limitations of pipettes used to transfer the samples. This is because the dilution factor used to calculate the original stock is inaccurate and hence the titre and amount of virus in the stock calculated is not accurate. Furthermore, the dilution process might not fully homogenously mix the virus stock. Additionally, the same amount of time was not given to each of the wells and this will result in different haemagglutination effect on the RBCs. Also, the removement of the supernatant after the sediment of the RBS was not perfect, as such the supernatant contain Lysed RBCs might further complicate the determination of end points. Finally, the pipettes used were of different sizes and different volumetric readings, thus all results obtained might not were precise and accurate.
