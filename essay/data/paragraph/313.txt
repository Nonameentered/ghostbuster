Archer applies a similar philosophy of upon which the realist argument will be built, will be sown Archer does this by attacking the 'elisionist' ontology of Giddens' 'structuration theory', advanced in his works 'Central Problems in Social Theory' and 'The Constitution of Society' (1981a; 1981b). 'Elisionism' is an approach which opposes the stratification of social reality into individuals and an emergent structure; according to elisionism, structure and individual agency are simultaneously productive, and the only distinction of substance between the two is the temporal priority of structure over agency (Archer, 1995; 62). In 'Central Problems' Giddens does admit that both structure and agency are irreducible to each other, but he tries to reconcile this tension by describing 'duality of structure' as agency which is both structuring and structured (Giddens, 1981a; 79). Archer contests this in TMGA as a mere re-statement of an individualistic or collectivistic ontology as she argues that, "if structure does not causally influence actors, be they individuals or collectivities, then any talk of structure is empty" (Archer, 1995; 63). Therefore, Archer claims that the elisionist approach is inadequate because it does not account for both the separability and the mutual dependence of structure and individual at all levels of social reality (Archer, 1995; 65). elisionist ontology Archer blasts elisionism for not providing an ontology of structure which can account for its causal influence on agents at different levels of the stratified social reality, (as was discussed in the section introducing Bhaskar'srealist ontology). Realism is the ontological approach which Archer claims is able to combine the separability and the mutual dependence of structure and individual at all levels of social reality (Archer, 1995; 65).
