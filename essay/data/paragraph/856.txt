The majority of the evidence discussed suggests that there are tetrachromats. It has been shown by Winderickx et al, (1992) and Cohn et al, (1989) that physiologically a woman can posses four different types of wavelength specific cones. Whether women in this position have the neural mechanisms to utilise an extra cone is more controversial. It has been shown behaviourally that women with four cones can be distinguished from women who have three, particularly by Jameson et al, (2001), and as this can be demonstrated behaviourally it implies that the women are having a different perceptual experience of colour than women who have three cones. It would also make sense for the visual system to adapt to an extra photopsin because the nervous system can change and update itself, and this has been demonstrated by Neitz et al, (2002). The fact that the extra photopsin is only six nanometres (Winderickx et al, 1992) away from the long wavelength specific cone suggests that if there are tetrachromats, as there appear to be, their colour vision is not likely to be much superior to a trichromats. As it has been shown by Jordan and Mollen, on simple behavioural tasks such as ratio matches there does not appear to be much difference at all. It is likely that cDa7 had a larger shift than the expected six nanometres to show tetrachromatic behaviour on these assessments. It appears conclusive that women can have four different wavelength specific cones, although the extent to which the extra is utilised and an advantage to colour vision still requires further investigation.
