The reductionist approach developed by Simmel still remains subject to a whole array of criticism. Indeed it seems too arbitrary to start an analysis of society with such an abstract concept divorced from any empirical content. Moreover, his focus on the microsocial lacks a framework to explain the big forms such as the state or the market. Simmel's theory may then lack a little bit in explanative strength, especially when one wants to study forms-of-sociation that range wider than merely small-scale communities.
