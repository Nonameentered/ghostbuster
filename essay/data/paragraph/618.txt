I have not argued that Stalin was a passive actor during his rise to power in the 1920's. He was an active force, using cunning, manipulation, and politics to engineer his position. However, he could not have done this without the other factors I have mentioned in this essay. All of them were important and I do not think Stalin would have emerged as leader of the party if any one was missing.
