To discuss 'regeneration' is to discuss Britain, and the concept it represents is that of 'Imperialism at Home'. Faced with the prospect of a declining industry and deteriorating relations with Europe, imperialism as 'the external motor of national reform', provided a shot of life to a declining empire. Imperial reforms such as the instituting of a representative government in India, expansion of the Indian railways, the establishment of public works, the introduction of private property, and the bridging of the gap between the metropolitan and colonies, were deemed necessary for not only the economic and political strength of the empire, but also as vital to the inward regeneration of the British nation. The success of these reforms helped to regenerate the British spirit, and maintain the high status of the British Empire.
