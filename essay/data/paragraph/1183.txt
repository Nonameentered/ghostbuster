The ability to comprehend the minds of people around you is imperative for child development: it not only aids communication and interaction but it also influences the person the child eventually becomes. Different cultures and even the individual communities within them have their own unique and distinct way of thinking and behaving; therefore, as a child learns about other people's mannerisms they also discover elements of their own mind (Gopnik et al., 1999) and the appropriate ways of behaving in different situations. At birth babies already seem to possess a great deal of knowledge about other people and effective ways of communicating with them, through interaction they develop their skills even further.
