'New' imperialism was only possible in the light of rapid industrialisation, which peaked during the mid-nineteenth century. Industrialisation required raw materials such as tin and iron to make steel, which could be obtained cheaply in the colonies; the movement from rural to urban areas, the subsequent shift from agriculture to industries, and the surge in population put severe strain on food production in the metropolis, which would be alleviated if the colonies took on the function of being the 'granaries of Europe'. Also, with the efficiencies of machinery, colonies could provide the markets needed to absorb the increased production. 'Moreover, cheaper markets were required to offset the general fall in prices from the 1870s to the 1890s (economic depression); with most industrial powers adopting protectionist tariffs, colonies could serve both needs." Finally, there is the theory of 'surplus capital' as expounded by Hobson 'aggressive imperialism...is a source of great gain to the investor who cannot find at home the profitable use he seeks for his capital, and insists that his government should help him to profitable and secure investments abroad...'
