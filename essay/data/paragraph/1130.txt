Myelination slows down the speed of conduction of neural impulses and thus can cause slowness of movement and loss of sensory abilities (Biological Psychology, 2002, p. 69). Also with the insulation gone, the messages being carried by the axons are no longer kept separate and this results in the sensory disorders and the loss of muscular control (Physiology Of Behaviour, 1991 p.29). Other symptoms of multiple sclerosis include numbness, difficulty with speech, muscle spasms and coordination problems. These problems with movement occur because the loss of the oligodendroglia cells weaken the electrical impulses from the brain and sometimes fail to transmit them at all.
