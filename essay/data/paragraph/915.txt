All of these arguments therefore appear to be perfectly logical and acceptable; however, as previously argued, I believe they are only acceptable if one first accepts the existence of memes. If one refuses to believe that such elements of culture exist or compete to get themselves replicated through imitation, there is no reason to believe Blackmore's theory. Furthermore, I believe that Blackmore goes too far in attempting to apply memes to areas such as mate selection, and in implying that memes are even responsible for our sense of a conscious self.
