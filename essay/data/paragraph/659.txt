Despite the great number of disadvantages to stage models which have reduced their favour over the last twenty years, it cannot be denied that they have influenced our understanding of cognitive development hugely. Many studies of a cross section of western cultures have found that an average rate of development does fit roughly into Piaget's four stages, although with a number of sub-stages, (Bowden, 1994). The idea of stages of development is held by many and still used in the education system as a simple way to fairly divide children. Piaget's and other stage models can be used as a marker for children's development, to suggest where a child of a specific age should be cognitively, and to highlight any possible learning difficulties at an early age, allowing appropriate teaching. Whilst other theories, such as those of connectivity or information processing, might account for the high level of complexity in cognition, they are often thought to be too complicated for use by parents and teachers and less implementable. In the field of development theories a conflict will always arise between parsimony (looking for one general model rather than many different ones) and accuracy (the general model may fail to do justice to the complexity of cognitive development. It must be said that the stage models given so far do oversimplify development and ignore other influences, but perhaps in the future a practical stage theory may be developed which takes into account all we know about physical and neural development in the brain and tries to incorporate the observable changes in skills, education, culture and environment.
