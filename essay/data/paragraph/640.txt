The already mentioned dualities and contradictions within the social position also made it difficult for women to keep to it. Men were to provide the control and authority, and as such were to be 'dominant' and 'virile' in order to keep their woman; 'command and government was not a privilege granted by wife to husband but a requirement of husband's manly calling'. However in order to be a 'good husband' and lead a successful marriage it was necessary for a man to be loving, caring, to give his wife an opinion particularly on matters of judgement, and to not be too 'absent masterful'. The fact that 'good governance' was seen as modulated according to the rule of 'love and gentleness', or 'softness' meant that the apparent contradiction between strong leadership but loving support when needed was something men found hard. Furthermore, advice guides show how confident and even aggressive women were when it came to stating their opinions and exercising their will, 'she should air her opinion while still holding to others. Female influence at court and in politics shows how women could not have achieved so much without command and authority. Authoritative and domineering women, whether in the private or public sphere, could not be simply 'unproblematic subservience' in order to achieve such levels of success.
