As described in the previous section, components of complement (e.g. C3 and specific antibodies) opsonize the bacterium in an attempt to remove it from the body (13, reviewed in 1). However, upon failure of complement-mediated killing, receptors on the surface of macrophages recognise the opsonins and allow a special whirling phagocytosis event to occur, characteristic of In the absence of opsonization, the Mip protein (macrophages invasion protein) found on the This Mip protein is only synthesised in response to low levels of amino acids and the consequent presence of uncharged transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which activates Rel A causing the accumulation of guanosine 3'5' bispyrophosphate synthetases (ppGpp). This accumulation results in entry into the stationary phase of replication and the expression of virulence traits that promote transmission e.g. the Mip protein. This example therefore illustrates how the growth phase of
