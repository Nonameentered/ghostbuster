One of Rousseau's ideas of human nature was that the strongest of human passions was 'If this leads to intervention in 'areas which are perceived as illiberal, such as the social and economic conditions of citizen's lives and with their beliefs and values', this is seen by Rousseau as a decision of the general will in order to secure the necessary conditions for socio-political liberty. Executive and lawmaking government of the welfare state is now generally expected to create policy that benefits the community in a broad social sense. Taxation, health security and economic intervention are put in place to equalise conditions and ensure a minimum standard of welfare for each citizen, whereas participation in elections for government positions is open to each citizen. This form of moderate liberal welfare state, however, fails to pass the test, since in this model the law does not come from all.
