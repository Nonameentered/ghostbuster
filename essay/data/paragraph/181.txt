Although "telling the code" could theoretically denote a wide range of activities, Wieder is able to consider it as an all-encompassing umbrella term for the social interaction that occurred within the facility, as 'the consent to use this resource showed itself in all social activity' (Wieder 1974: 164). By utilising "telling the code" as a means of explaining social events, the residents were able to construct meaning through shared understandings of '"what goes on"' (Wieder 1974: 152): an interpretative matrix applicable for explaining the "transactions" between staff and residents. From this standpoint, the analysis of "telling the code" then becomes examination of the 'strategic devices which would enable one to grasp the peculiarity of everyday life' (Garfinkel 1967: 7). The core of the convict code is, according to Wieder, the recognition of a mutual 'expectancy of distrust' (Wieder 1974: 155) between staff and residents in the facility. This tension becomes noticeable by two tactics, '...the strategy of defiance and the strategy of cooperation' (Wieder 1974: 151), on the side of the residents. Compulsory activities, such as drug testing and chore obligations, are viewed as incursions into the domain of the resident, who 'reacts against incursions by remaining distant and uncommunicative' (Wieder 1974: 153). On the other hand, Wieder has residents employ a more conciliatory approach to staff on 'informal and peripheral matters' (Wieder 1974: 153). Here, stereotypical modes of behaviour such as complimenting -the food- or some activity that reflects to a point at which it is hardly worthwhile in terms of its effort/yield ratio - are
