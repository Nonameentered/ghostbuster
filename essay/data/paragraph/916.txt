Traditional genetic evolutionary theory suggests we choose mates based on fitness and biological advantage; men are sexually attracted to women who appear fertile, with big hips and youthful, symmetrical features, whilst women are attracted to strong, high-status men with plentiful resources. Essentially we should choose to mate with people who would, in the environment of our evolutionary past, have helped to increase our genetic legacy (Blackmore, 1999). Blackmore suggests mate choice is based not only on genetic advantage, but also memetic advantage. Once memes arose in our far past, natural selection would favour people who chose to mate with the best imitators. In an early hunter-gatherer society a man who was especially good at imitation would have been able to copy the latest hunting skills or stone tool technology and hence would have gained a biological advantage. Thus a woman who mated with him would be more likely to have children who shared that imitation ability and that advantage. Such a woman would have to look in potential mates for signs of the general ability to imitate and innovate. This argument suggests we will still want to mate with the best imitators and spreaders of memes, such as writers, artists, journalists, broadcasters, film stars and musicians (Blackmore, 1999). However, whilst it may be the case that some high profile people who are prominent in the media are often seen as desirable mates, this is not true for all such people, and I do not think it can be reasonably argued that we choose mates on the basis of whether they are a good imitator. Firstly, we arguably do not know what the signs of a good imitator are, and secondly, in being attracted to someone we tend to consider factors such as their looks and personality; we are certainly not aware of considering their potential for spreading memes.
