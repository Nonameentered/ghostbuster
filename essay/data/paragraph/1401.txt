Fuel is supplied to the engine from a fuel tank connected to a carburettor. This mixes the fuel with air by carburetion. This new air/fuel mixture can then be taken directly into the engine. Inside the engine we have a crankshaft, which is actuated by a piston connected to the crank by a connecting rod (conrod). The piston is moved down under pressure when the fuel/air mixture ignites using a two-stroke engine cycle:
