Blackmore's theory is certainly well argued, and her justifications of both the meme-gene analogy and how memes drive many aspects of human development are theoretically sound. However, I believe there may be an initial flaw in Blackmore's argument in that she appears to take the existence of memes for granted and expounds her detailed argument from this premise when this fact is not necessarily clear. It may be contended that if one refuses to acknowledge the reality of memes, Blackmore's argument fails. One can question whether cultural evolution is truly analogous to genetic evolution (Dennett, 1995), whether there are really cultural units that have interests of their own, and whether imitation is indeed the driving force behind all human behaviour (Holdcroft & Lewis, 2001). Midgley (2000), for example, calls memes 'mythical entities' and an 'empty and misleading metaphor'. She argues that thought and culture cannot be broken down into distinct units, since they are moving and developing patterns in human behaviour. There is therefore no use in trying to understand them by tracing reproductive interactions among memetic units Midgley, 1999).
