Archer critiques individualism because it starts from the empirically secure position that the ultimate constituents of society are people, yet has to incorporate non-human features into its conception of the individual when its ontology is challenged. Individualism's principle that social structures and phenomena must be reduced to statements about the interrelations of individuals (because the individual is the ultimate constituent part of society) leaves it susceptible to criticism from psychologists who state that people themselves can be reduced further still into their underlying psychological features (Archer, 1995; 39). Due to their belief in reductionism it becomes difficult for individualists to deny the psychologists' claim that society is the reflection of the combined psyches of the population (Archer, 1995; 40). However, to defend their position from psychologists Individualists invoke the realist (and collectivist) notion of emergence. They claim that their concept of the individual is unique because it is defined by the individual's participation in This recognition of an emergent structure (such as the English language) contradicts individualism's premise that everything in society is reducible to an individual's dispositions. The response of individualism to this criticism is to incorporate all non-individual and non-dispositional factors into their concept of the individual, such as a person's 'physical resources and environment' (Watkins, 1971, in Archer, 1995; 39). This again reveals a contradiction, as these aspects of social reality are not about individuals or dispositions (the exclusive focus of individualism) yet are central to the its concept of the individual. Individualism's inability to discredit realism's (and collectivism's) conception of social structure provides further evidence of its inability to uphold 'the tri-partite link'.
