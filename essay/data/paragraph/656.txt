Probably the best known and most influential stage model of cognitive development is Jean Piaget's. His model of children's development includes four main stages of cognitive, sensorimotor, pre-operational, concrete operational and formal operational. Piaget was of the opinion that the brain was not merely a receiver of information, but was actively involved in creating knowledge through processes of assimilation and accommodation. During the sensorimotor stage (0-2 years) the child's knowledge of the world is limited to behaviour, and his understanding is only based upon what can be done physically, such asExplore – Predictions – Practical Session – Findings – Conglusions and Evaluate. object permanence. The pre-operational stage (2-7 years) saw the use of symbols, language and imaginative play, but the child was said to be operating without logical thought and was unable to understand rules such as conservation, (Donaldson, 1987). The concrete operative stage (7-11 years) is demonstrated when the child has formed reasoning skills and combines this with practical knowledge and understanding of objects in the world to make abstract conclusions. Finally in the formal operative stage (11+ years) the child creates his own knowledge using structures of thought, forming ideas which can be tested and data collected.
