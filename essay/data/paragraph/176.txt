The emergence of the sociological school of ethnomethodology in the early 1960s created a shock wave across the sociological establishment. Its revision of social norms and their relation to the social action springing from individual cases of social interaction was indeed deemed so radical that stories exist of 'ethnomethodologists being fired from their jobs simply because they were ethnomethodologists' (Craib 1992: 102). However, what may at first glance appear a drastically individualistic approach to social relations theory must be seen as embedded within a wider philosophical and social scientific critique of the value of conventional types of knowledge (Alexander 1987).
