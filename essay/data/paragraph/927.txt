Methods Participants Participants were 100 undergraduate psychology students from a small university in the North West of England. All subjects were aged between 18 and 25, with a mean age of 19.73. There were 58 female participants and 42 males.  Materials The material used in this study was a beer bong, ten large shot glasses, an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), and a Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WOCQ) (Folkman and Lazarus, 1988). The beer bong was used to measure actual alcohol consumption, with participants being required to consume one can of beer each. The amount of beer initially poured was measured using a shot glass and all those who completed the beer bong were given a 10ml shot of whiskey. The AUDIT was used to ascertain levels of alcohol consumption and the WOCQ was used to assess coping styles.  Procedure Participants were informed that they were going to take part in a study investigating student drinking behaviour. They were given a copy of the AUDIT to complete before the actual drinking games. The AUDIT was followed by the group beer bong game. When this was completed, participants were given a ten ml shot of tequila and instructed to complete the WOCQ.  Results
