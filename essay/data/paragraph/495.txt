From the experiment, the rotational time taken can be obtained from Where M is the moment arm , r is the radius of the disc and t is the time taken. Solving for I, Where I is the calculated moment of inertia of the disc.   The theoretical value of the inertia obtained from the theory can be obtained from  Where m is the mass and r is the radius of the disc.  Comparing the results obtained from the experiment with the values derived from the theoretical relationship it can be seen that the two values are consistent with a maximum percentage error of 7%.
