The range of virulence factors present on the bacterial surface not only allow a greater likelihood of entry into host cells, but also provide the bacterium with resistance from environmental stresses relevant to the aquatic environment (e.g. iron starvation and biocidal treatments). These virulence factors are also expressed as part of the unidirectional shift from generation to generation, forming an adaptive strategy suitable for successful entry into and replication within the host (1, reviewed in 1).
