In quantitative terms reliability is defined as being the extent to which a particular study could be replicated and the same results achieved (Colman, 2001). Validity can be defined as the extent to which a test measures that which it claims to (Colman, 2001). Using these traditional definitions it is difficult to claim that qualitative research is either reliable or valid. This is because the main tool of the qualitative researcher is discourse analysis and the conclusions made are often open to interpretation as it is the job of the researcher to make inferences as opposed to statistics. There is often a large diversity of meanings that we can attribute to differing interpretations (Parker, 1994). This imposes the confounding variable of researcher bias, therefore reducing the validity of the analysis. It is also claimed that qualitative research lacks reliability, as due to the individualised nature of the methodology it would be difficult to repeat a study and gain exactly the same results (Merrick, 1999).
