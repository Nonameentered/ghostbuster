An area of growing interest which does indicate the potential negative implications of emotion-focused avoidance coping, however, is that of alcohol consumption and abuse, and it is within this area that the present study is focused. It is a widespread belief that alcohol serves to reduce tension and anxiety in an individual, with this theory being formalised in Conger's tension-reduction hypothesis (1956, cited in Erickson, 2004). The tension-reduction hypothesis is supported by physiological evidence which indicates that alcohol functions to depress central nervous activity and leads to decreased cortical arousal, resulting in a decrease in tension anxiety (Schwarz, Burkhart & Green, 1978), and by other numerous studies that have shown that alcohol reduces both physiological and psychological responsivity to stressful situations (Stasiewicz & Lisman, 1995; Hull & Young, 1983; Levenson, Sher, Grossman, Newman & Newlin, 1980). However, it remains unclear whether the effect is a function of alcohol's impact on tension per se or cognisance of the stressor (Hull, 1981), and some studies have found that alcohol actually serves to increase self-reported anxiety. Evidence for the model is therefore mixed.
