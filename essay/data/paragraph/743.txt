The Black Death had profound social effects. It wiped out an estimated one-third of the British population causing a massive labour shortage and inflation of wages. As a result, the 'poor had an increased self confidence' Although more money was being earned by workers, landowners attempted to ensure that their financial interests were safeguarded. This was the first time that politicians had to take account of people other than the upper classes; the lower classes were gaining influence. The social structure of Medieval Europe was also changed as the great landowners who had once held considerable power were now 'less able to impose their authority' On the continent, aristocrats were being replaced by rich merchants and financiers, who were the ones taking advantage of the increased incomes. These social changes were large steps towards the transformation of Europe into a capitalist civilization.
