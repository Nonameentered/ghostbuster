The government created an efficient wartime economy. 'The war years witnessed the greatest triumph of Soviet planning." Almost 1,500 factories were moved in two months and 3,500 big new factories were built from scratch during the war Also, by 1945 Russia had more railway lines operating than at any time in their history. This required mass organisation and money. At its peak, more than half the national income was devoted to armaments. Work to complete the factories continued into the freezing night, requiring incredible endurance and therefore it is down to the Russian people that relocation and production were successful. 'In World War II the Soviet economy supplied the eastern front with tens of millions of soldiers and weapons. These soldiers and weapons destroyed Hitler's dream of a German empire in Europe." Rearmament was very fast. Munitions output doubled in 1942 and peaked in 1944. 'What won the war for the Allies, in the end, was their ability to produce munitions in greater - much greater - quantity than Germany and Japan." According to some historians, although the quality was similar, the sheer volume of products won the war for Russia. The volume of products created can be attributed to the hard work of the Soviet people, but also the Soviet government for organising the production line so effectively.
