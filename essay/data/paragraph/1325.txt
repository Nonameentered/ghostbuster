Jean Piagetâ€™s developmental theory has had an extensive influence on the structure of education. This theory suggests that the process of assimilating information and consolidating knowledge correlates directly with age. Piaget divided the process of development into four stages, namely the sensori-motor stage, pre-operational stage, concrete operational stage, and the formal operational stage. He maintained that all of these stages take place within designated age ranges. His theory is also domain-general, suggesting that knowledge attained by a young learner will be applicable to various contexts and situations.   Mainstream educators have found Piaget's theory to be the most convincing and useful when it comes to structuring educational plans. Therefore, Piaget's developmental framework is commonly applied by educators when trying to design and implement the best teaching methods for their students. This essay will explore the cognitive research stemming from Piaget's domain-general theory on the subject of primary school education, and its implications on teaching functions. Furthermore, it will discuss whether research into the specific cognitive development of primary school-aged children can be merged with the current science curriculum, or if such a research-based approach is a better alternative to the Piagetian-based age-centric domain-general learning approach.
