The Taiping Rebellion (1850-64), the Nian Rebellion (1851-68) and the Muslim Rebellions (1855-73), and the White Lotus Rebellion (1795-1840) though different in many aspect, had a common thread, in that these rebellions also shared with the Provincial Uprisings of the late 19 Much of these uprisings were caused by the coercion and control by the state, excessive taxation, and increased military campaigns which impaired the right of the people, hence rendering them vulnerable to the appeals and promises of the leaders of the movements. The burdens which the common people had to bear was aggravated by the fact that famine was part of the social landscape of the period, 'China had been in the grip of a three decade famine starting from 1810, which crippled the economic welfare of millions of people in North China..." Famines were often caused by drought or combination of drought with floods, and these were the root causes of the Taiping,Nian and Muslim rebellions and various Provincial Uprisings. The people during the Qing period had no remedies for these natural disasters; so it was not easy for the population to bear the additional strain of increased taxation imposed by the government. The increase in tax levies, corvee (slavery worked for the state) could explain the Nian rebellion, which was largely sparked off by the imposition of such levies. In Hebei for example, the establishment of new magistrate's offices, 'meaning an increase of official servants and public burdens- generated a wave of riots and uprisings in the vicinities of Beijing'. China's downfall to opium has been magnified to an unreasonable extent by some historians, but the excessive burden of both opium and salt taxation, which negatively affect the majority of the population, could be seen as contributing factors that fermented rebellion.
