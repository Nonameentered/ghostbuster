The cable must be insulated from the metal of the frame at both ends. This will protect any stray currents or induce any currents from nearby cables into the wire. These insulation sleeves can be made from an insulating material such as rubber or Teflon. In wet areas, it is important to use a material like Teflon as it has a resistance to water, which rubber does not.
