The endosymbiotic theory proposes that the ancestor of mitochondria, chloroplasts and hydrogenosomes originated from the endocytosis of aerobic prokaryotes by anaerobic eukaryotes. This theory was first proposed by one of the great evolutionary biologists of all time, Dr. Lynn Margulis. The idea behind the endosymbiotic theory is that the organelles had their own DNA, which was introduced into the host eukaryotic cell, which then formed an endosymbiotic relationship. This led to the formation of larger and more complex cells, rather than the smaller simpler prokaryotes. This happens due to the combination of the different abilities of the symbionts and the host cell, making them more efficient and adaptive than either of the two on their own The two main components of the endosymbiotic theory is that firstly, the organelles arose from aerobic prokaryotic cells which were taken into the host eukaryotic cells and secondly, the host eukaryotic cells and the endocytosed bacteria became mutually dependent of each other due to a beneficial relationship.  The evidence that most closely supports the endosymbiotic theory includes molecular information about the origin of the organelles, gene transfer, molecular phylogeny, antibiotic specificity, double membrane structure and the evidence from amoebas.
