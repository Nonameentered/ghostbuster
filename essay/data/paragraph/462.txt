This equation is useful as it can be used to calculate the value of the Michaelis constant (K  The enzyme used in this experiment was an alkaline phosphatase from calf intestinal mucosa (EC 3.1.3.1). It is a dimeric enzyme with each monomer containing two zinc ions held in place by coordinating amino acids. It is found in most mammalian cells carrying out a variety of biological roles such as in the breakdown of nucleotides and DNA related reactions as well as in calcium metabolism. It is relatively heat stable and is active at a broad range of pHs between pH4 and 11.
