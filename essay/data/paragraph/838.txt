To support this MacDonald (1987) (as cited in Henggeler, 1991) found that preschool boys who had been assessed as being "rejected" had parents who were less interpersonally responsive and were less emotionally positive. These children were more likely to have been considered to have had an attachment type of anxious avoidant or anxious resistant. If child had this attachment type then they will not have had a secure base from which to explore from and particularly anxious resistant children would have been anxious at leaving the caregiver and facilitating early social relationships.
