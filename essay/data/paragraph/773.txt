Charles Darwin provided the first explanation for the means by which evolution takes place. This was by the process of natural selection. A key aspect of Darwin's ideas was that species were not immutable, that they could change in their essential characteristics. It had been a common belief that species were immutable because of the writings in the Bible. Genesis mentioned the species that God had created and it was assumed that only God could create new species. Darwin was worried about the implications of his ideas. In January 1844 he wrote to J. D. Hooker claiming that it was 'like confessing a murder' However, many of Darwin's ideas had been in discussion by earlier natural historians and Romantic thinkers in the decades before he published his Romanticism began in the mid-eighteenth century and reached its height in the nineteenth century. The Romantics questioned old beliefs, requiring proof before they believed in something. They would study nature closely and believed that man was closely linked with the natural world. In this way Darwin was also a Romantic thinker.
