High levels of avoidance coping have consistently been found to be predictive of problem drinking, which is highest among young adults. Students in particular have greatly elevated levels of drinking in comparison to the general population. One hundred undergraduates were asked about the way they cope with a high academic workload. Alcohol consumption was found to correlate positively with avoidance coping and negatively with seeking social support. Thus students who attempt to disengage and forget about their problems, and those who do not like to seek help or confide in others, are typically those with higher levels of alcohol consumption. Further research could investigate whether high levels of alcohol consumption avoidance coping significantly impact academic achievement.
