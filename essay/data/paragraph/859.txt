Pennington and Hastie (1992) conducted a study in which they hypothesised that presenting the evidence in a fashion that conformed to one particular story, would cause jurors to adopt this story, and depending on the nature of the story, result in a guilty or not guilty verdict. In order to achieve this effect, instead of presenting evidence to the jury in witness order (as would happen in a real trial), Pennington and Hastie (1992) organized the evidence in a way that would make one story easier to construct than another, without altering the nature of the evidence. They found that verdicts returned were consistent with the order in which the evidence was presented, thus implying that stories are a mediating mechanism in jury decision making.
