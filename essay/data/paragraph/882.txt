Propaganda in Russia constantly told the people that the Bolsheviks were in charge of Russia and life would improve. It is difficult to assess how successful the propaganda was because there were few object opinion polls, but the fact that rebellions existed shows that the Bolsheviks did not have control over the population in the way they imagined. However, propaganda may have reduced the threat that popular opinion posed. Although many rebellions posed strong threats it is unlikely that the popular movement would have defeated the Bolsheviks, because they had many spontaneous uprisings and the peasants and workers were spread across Russia with no one leader and the Bolsheviks, especially by the end of 1919, were very strong. 'The Bolsheviks must have been a tiny minority of the Russian population, which through superior organisation, ruthless determination and efficient propaganda snatched victory from an inefficient, divided and silent majority.'
