Investigations into learned eating behaviour in rats appear to display this influence. After a few days of feeding at a certain time each day, the rats displayed behaviour of expecting food, even when they had just been fed (F. Schlaghecken, lecture, 5 This suggests that after a relatively short period of time behaviour concerning eating can be learned and apparently override the internal drives of satiety. This evidence would strongly imply that a person has considerable control over their weight and the ability to lose weight; if behaviour regarding eating can be learned in a matter of days, forming new eating habits or reversing old habits ought to be possible.
