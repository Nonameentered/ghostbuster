This tension was in fact exacerbated by the presence of a third party, in this case the sociologist, who, as he recognised himself, held 'paralleled access to two sets of naturally occurring conversations' (Wieder 1974: 171). While one conversation between Wieder and the resident is a "public" one, in which resident and sociologist engage in behaviour which appears to confirm the existing structure of norms (labelled by Wieder as "the code"), behind the scenes in a private conversation, we find a different level of conversation, one that incorporates an unrestricted range of possibilities for manipulating the code when necessary. In this regard, Wieder describes the interaction between staff and residents as 'a sociological demonstration of ordinary circumstances' (Wieder 1974: 161). Hereby, Wieder reflects on the relationship between the convict code as an interpretative tool and its meaning in actual practices of norm attribution.
