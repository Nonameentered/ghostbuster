In the political sphere, the Black Death had a great impact. The Medieval system based on vassalage was largely a success in the Middle Ages, but after the plague it began to breakdown as it could no longer meet the needs of the people. Kings, such as Edward III, had to acknowledge the 'increasing independent spirit of the people' Peasants began to challenge 'entrenched ideas of ascriptive feudalism by emphasizing rights over obligations' More people became landowners and many helped themselves at the expense of churches. Landlords had no 'legal compulsion' over those who worked the land after the Black Death. This had a knock on effect on the power of the rest of the nobility. With the lower classes enjoying new power, the Kings increased their authority and attempted to use their increased resources to gain more control.  The Church also suffered a blow after the Black Death. People 'increasingly rejected its dogmas' They lost faith in papal authority as they felt that the Church had abandoned them when they were in need. The Black Death gave rise to a new level of scepticism. In the past, it was accepted that disasters were God's will and prayers were said asking for forgiveness for sins. This did not happen during the Black Death, as people felt that it was not their fault. David Herlihy comments on the widespread realism of the period: 'they said less of God, and more of nature' This was in stark contrast to the period before the Black Death. The Church made 'little attempt to free itself from the scientific views which had grown up around it' Instead it started to use superstition to explain the plague. The Church also had to face the fact that many of its members, such as bishops, abbots and priests, had died from the plague. This meant that many traditions originating from its members were lost and people no longer had to pledge their assets to the Church on death.
