Growth Kinetics The growth kinetics for the nine bacterial species studied last week are shown in figure four of the appendix. The data shows evidence of a lag phase, an exponential phase, a retardation phase and finally a stationary phase for all nine organisms. This is a typical growth graph for bacteria and follows the pattern of the Smith-Alvarez growth curve.
