With patients who display deep personality disorders though, treatment can be very difficult as behaviour is hard to predict and rewards of this kind give little motivation. One particular example is narcissistic personality disorder, which is an all-pervasive disorder similar to alcoholism but worse. It consumes the whole personality and therefore cannot be changed at will with therapy or training. Narcissists display many reckless behaviours, some incontrollable, and so rational learning therapies rarely have any effect. It is these severe psychological disorders which cannot be treated by a strictly behavioural approach - although behaviour modification can help with some effects, there is no effective therapy for narcissism itself, (Young, 1990).
