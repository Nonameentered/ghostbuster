To guarantee the stream will be used for hydroelectric production, Nick needs to install a penstock as close as possible to the damn and leave the damn open so that there is as little pressure built in the pipe as possible, allowing the same flow rate to be sent down the pipe to the turbine. The penstock also prevents turbulence in the downstream section as turbulence can decrease total pressure and hence flow rates through the turbine.  Nick should ensure there is a snifter valve at the damn end of the pipe, preventing debris from travelling down the pipe and damaging the turbine blades.
