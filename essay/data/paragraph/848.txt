Cohn et al (1989) made an attempt to investigate this further. First, they compared the most common polymorphism of red opsin, alanine at point 180 for long wavelength cones, to serine. Cohn et al (1989) found that when they looked at a female who was heterozygous for the two polymorphisms, with alanine in one x chromosome and serine in the other, and applied a laser which disabled one x chromosome in each of the cones, almost all of the cones contained either alanine or serine. Normal cells contained serine, but they also found a number of type 3 cells which contained alanine in just one of the x chromosomes in the cone. Cohn et al (1989) concluded that this was a consequence of x inactivation, which is a phenomenon which occurs during embryonic development, where one of the x chromosomes inherited from the mother, is randomly inactivated in the majority of cells in female animals. It is this random number of cells which inherits either alanine or serine which explains why Cohn et al (1989) found that some cells contained alanine in just one of the x chromosomes.
