Susan Amussen argues that the attempts of women to remain faithful to their prescribed social position, but failure due to the impractical, unrealistic nature of the position, is shown by women's emphasis on the sexual conduct part of the role; the part that was actually achievable. Faced with the impossibility of the obedience part, women placed greater importance on strict sexual conduct. Where possible women were willing to adhere to their prescribed social positions; helping to maintain the social order so important to early modern society. The gap between theory and practice in the social position of women in early modern England should be explained in terms of its impractical economic nature and its contradictory and unrealistic expectations.
