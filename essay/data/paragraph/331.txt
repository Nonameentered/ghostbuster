The paper begins by examining a particular air strategy document produced by Air Staff, exemplified in Figure 1 below. It is the 'Proposal for Peace Strength of the RAF' - and is useful in revealing the early interpretation of air strategy in 1919.  The Figure is best at highlighting the developing dynamism of aerospace strategy, institutionalised around the implementation of air power into 'an hour glass of defence' The Air Staff emphasized that, should war break out, 'the importance of the defence of the ground forces by aircraft is known by all' in a traditionally traditional war; however 'this must reach its maximum efficiency in a more mobile kind of warfare' This recognition of the offensive capabilities of air power is endurable by the Figure, which reveals that at peace time the RAF should consist of, not only Home Defence and Overseas squadrons, but also involve some 32 training squadrons with a huge complement of reserves. This strategical portfolio demonstrates what a radical break point had been reached in 1919, with the Air Staff finally starting to think logically in terms of offensive operations, instead of solely air control. It is also important to note that the RAF was to employ what Air Staff termed 'strategic offensive bombing,' aiming to 'render great cities uninhabitable' This point confronts pre-existing literature on air policy in the 1920s, which holds that strategic bombing was not seriously taken up until later.
