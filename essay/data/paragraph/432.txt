The origin of undulipodia, despite being fundamental for endosymbiotic theory, has yet to be resolved. There is heated debate between the endogenous and exogenous hypotheses for the origin of undulipodia. The endogenous hypothesis propose that microtubules were internalised to become the mitotic spindle, a cytoplasmic structure involved in mitosis, and were then adapted to become the undulipodia. The other half of the argument proposes that undulipodia were acquired endogenously through motility symbiosis, in which a bacterial partner provided the host eukaryote with an external motor for cell motility.
