The innate immune system recognises bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and mannose residues on soluble proteins and reacts Much like the innate and humoral immune responses, the generation of these reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines therefore destroys the pathogen, eliminating it from the host (14, reviewed in 1). In addition, the presence of the microorganism stimulates the production and expansion of T cells
