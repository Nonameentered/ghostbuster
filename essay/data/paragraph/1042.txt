The writer's main emphasis on public monuments reflects her bias in thinking that such forms of public art are more effective in inculcating a common sense of destiny, and fulfilling the social and political functions attached to them, more so than films, books and painting can. With the boom of the Holocaust industry however, films have become an essential medium by which large populations can learn more about the Holocaust. The writer has avoided a direct answer to the question up to this point, but has attempted to illustrate the many debates and considerations that have arise from the question. In conclusion, the Holocaust should be memorialised according to its time and location, asserting its relevance in the lives of the denizens there. Also, it is worth noting that 'new generations visit memorials under new circumstances and invest them with new meanings', and since there is no one universally accepted way of memorialising the Holocaust, the normative connotation posed by the question above is self-defeating, and ought not to be answered by a historian.
