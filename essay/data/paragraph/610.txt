I find it hard to justify putting Stalin's rise to power down to any one single factor. It does not seem possible that Stalin reached his position purely due to his own manipulation or political cunning. Nor does it seem realistic that he was put in power purely because he was the politician that most reflected the party rank and file wishes. A number of reasons seems the most probable explanation; I will argue that the most important are as follows. Stalin proved a useful asset to Lenin and as a result Lenin often supported Stalin's appointments and promotions. The positions Stalin held within the party were of vital importance in helping him gain power, his personality and his political prowess were also very important in this respect. The mistakes of Stalin's rivals during the 1920's were to prove fatal and helped him in his ascendancy to power.
