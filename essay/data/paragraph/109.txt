One aspect that I observed, which I noted as noteworthy or unusual, is the fact that customers seem to tread carefully when being in the vicinity of other customers. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that a certain agreement exists among customers about the quality of atmosphere that is desirable. This 'unwritten agreement' seeks to maintain the so-called 'bookshop etiquette', which consists of respect for each individual. Generally, this respect is expressed by speaking quietly and by keeping distance â€“ if not physical distance then at least a respectful distance. Books showing titles such as 'how to get the most out of your relationship' indicate the individual nature of books and the following of their contents. Put differently, the customers give each other the opportunity to read, undisturbed, what books one might in private choose to read. This, then, accounts for the relatively silent and static atmosphere of the book shop, stimulating private activities such as reading, or browsing through books.
