It was in the historical context of the religious and political upheaval of the 1640s, and the subsequent breakdown of censorship (which made fertile ground for the ferment of radical ideas), that Winstanley first made his appearance as a pamphleteer. Considering that Winstanley was only prominent as a writer between 1648-1652, and thereafter faded into oblivion, there seems to be a disproportionate amount of literature written about him, with little consensus over how we should understand such a complex figure. The most prominent debate revolves around Winstanley's evolution as a thinker- while most agree that he started off as a religious thinker, few concur on his predilections (secular or religious or both) in the While the question above seems to be fairly straightforward, it is in this writer's opinion that the position one takes in the fore-mentioned debate has bearings on how one would view the nature of Winstanley's religious outlook in Therefore, while an examination of the primary sources is necessary, it is equally important to consider the interpretations of some historians on Winstanley, and, as far as possible, how their biases feature in the following themes: the nature of Winstanley's millenarianism; his conception of God; his understanding of the Fall and Restoration; and finally his views on the institutionalized church.
