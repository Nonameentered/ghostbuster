The concept of 'luxury' is of course a product of its time, and although there are certain features that persist through its definition throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century, there were shifts in meanings that were inextricably bound up with the changing perception of taste and sociability. The modern notion of luxury, as exemplified in Veblen's commentary (see quote above), was viewed by the critics of the eighteenth century as artificial and hence, unnatural-a view that was rooted in their antediluvian repulsion of the foreign. Luxury then, was still associated with foreignness and vice, which is fittingly illustrated by Thomas de Quincey, where he exclaims in response to the wealthy inhabitants of London in the late eighteenth century: "we will not call it luxury...but...avarice, which is a great evil, and so far aggravated by its manifestation in a people naturally inclined to luxury". This position was supported by the observation of a decline in Chinese silk-weaving, which was attributed to the corrupting influence of wealth, and argued that these claims are not unfounded, due to the "native progress of luxury in China". The idea of 'luxury' as foreign and un-natural was challenged by the eighteenth century liberalizers such as Mandeville, who was in fact a closet-political liberal, who argued instead that luxury is "the sign of a society which is rich and enlarged by a hope of benefits that it can enjoy" ; and that "the possession of such goods is the natural property of those who can afford to pay of them" This view was also shared by the rise of the consumer societies in the late nineteenth century.  In attempting to explain the rise of the consumer societies, Sombart wrote in Luxury and Capitalism from the notion of "conspicuous consumption" Veblen argued that the late nineteenth century was the time when the competition for rank and power began to overshadow those for that of "economic efficiency", and that luxuries have become "marks of loyalty and trustworthiness to one's peers, devices of display to fetch an invidious comparison with the pecuniary strength of one another." While Smith had argued that luxury comprises of "utilities for the delight of human life", the late nineteenth century saw a broader conception, which extended further to include those luxurious objects that had "no reasonable or intelligible use." Therefore, Veblen's "useless expenditure, which is known as 'conspicuous consumption'...forms the basis of the leisure-class morality;" It is important to note however that for Veblen, the "real pride and joy of the human heart lies in pride of admiration from others" , thus emphasizing the link between luxury, consumption and the opinions of others. Veblen's observation that "the leisure class are not...manufacturers and producers"
