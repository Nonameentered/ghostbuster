The connection of British femininity with a high morality, and the idea of gender equalities through historical argumentation were common ground arguments for the vote in the late nineteenth century. Although arguments of the 'constitutionalists' always sought to stay within the boundaries of middle class respectability, they certainly incorporated argumentation based upon the female body (Holton 1998). The most evident examples of this can be found in racist theories. Female authors attempted to present an image of a superior British race, of which women, had, by necessity, always been part. Charlotte Carmichael Stopes', in her book 'The moral codes, Constitutionalist feminists increasingly began to make use of racial reasoning to support their campaign for the vote (Holton 1998). This provided the movement with a legal means of enhancing female respectability and high morale in a way that was compatible and in harmony with society.
