The authors of Start with the unpopular. Murray and Herrnstein argue that large differences in intelligence, generally taken to be measured by IQ test results, occur between different ethnic groups. Their conclusion, drawn from the evidence, is that 'it is important to remember that these are statistical rather than individually applicable conclusions' (p. 301). This is later presented in the book as a matter of choice for minorities in the United States of America (USA). Furthermore, the authors justify their course of reasoning by the fact that 'Cognitive excellence is increasingly valuable in the culture that is now in place in the United States' (p. 313). The justification for their stance on this potentially explosive topic seems to digress from the original purpose of the book, while the social danger of such statements is bound to exist.
