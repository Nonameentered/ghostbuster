Unfortunately the computer program did not operate as expected so that the comparison between computer results and manual calculations could not be conducted. However, the variation of parameters in the computer program was limited so that only a limited number of comparisons could be done even though the programs were working properly. More developments and improvements were required in gear and shaft program so that a variety of variables could be selected for analysis.
