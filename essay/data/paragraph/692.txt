Researchers have argued that road crossing skills in children depend on attentional skills and ability to concentrate on a task during a distracting event. Dunbar, Lewis and Hill (2001) found that children showing greater attention switching skills were more aware of traffic when observed crossing roads and that maintaining attention throughout distractions might indicate a greater likelihood of crossing roads in a safe manner. Previous studies had used attention switching tasks such as reporting letters and numbers heard in either of two auditory streams, i.e. attending to the left or right ear (Pearson & Lane, 1991), to assess differences in time taken to move attention between the streams. It was found that younger children took longer and showed higher error rates when switching attention than older children, suggesting that attention skills improve with age. This study aims to test the idea that attentional skills improve with age, using the test of everyday attention for children, whereby children must inhibit their natural responses while a distracting event occurs. The study also aims to test earlier findings that primary school age boys have more road accidents than girls of the same age, by comparing attentional performance between the two gender groups. There are, therefore, three main hypotheses; firstly that responses in the task will be slower where a distracting event occurs than where there is no distraction, across all groups, secondly, that the response speed will improve with age in both distracting and quiet conditions, and thirdly, that boys will perform more slowly than girls during the distracting event.
