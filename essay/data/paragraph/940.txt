The conceptual reason behind Zimbardo's experiment was to test the power of social situations over individuals. The focus was on the power of roles, rules, symbols, group identity, and situational validation of ordinarily ego-alien behaviors and behavioral styles. Zimbardo explored the theory of deindividuation and its influence on obedience. The psychological state of deindividuation is aroused when individuals become part of a crowd or large group. This state is characterized by diminished self-awareness and individuality. There is a reduction in an individual's self-restraint and normative regulation of behavior which leads to a newfound obedience to any form of authority.
