It has therefore been concluded that emotion-focused strategies tend to be maladaptive. This has major implications since emotion-focused coping is generally invoked much more often than less avoidance-oriented strategies in response to stress (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984), suggesting that if emotion-focused strategies are indeed maladaptive in certain circumstances then many people may be more likely to experience psychological distress. However, it should also be mentioned that a deficiency in emotion-focused coping strategies is also likely to be damaging; indeed, it appears that it is not simply the use of emotion-focused strategies, but their inefficient use that is maladaptive (Eckenrode, 1984; Jones, Skovholt & Ferguson, 1988). It is therefore somewhat difficult to discern the exact nature and level of emotion-focused coping that is necessary for adaptive functioning in response to certain stressful situations for an individual.
