The substantia nigra is a group of neurons in the region of the midbrain whose axons go to the basal ganglia. The cell bodies of the dopamine system lie within this region and are involved in motor control via the basal ganglia and in particular to the striatum cells of the substantia nigra. The nerve cells in the substantia nigra communicate with other cells on the nearby striatum by releasing the neurotransmitter dopamine at the nerve terminals, which is also synthesised there and is the area of the brain that controls movement and balance ( The basal ganglia usually impose constraints on motor control, but the absence of these constraints yields persistent excess of movement or slowness of movement and marked changes in muscle tone (Biological Psychology, 2002, p.352).
