To further research this area, Jameson et al, (2001) tried to investigate tetrachromacy using techniques that they considered to be more reliable, and found a far higher incidence rate of tetrachromacy. Jameson et al, (2001) propose that ratio matching is not a reliable technique to measure tetrachromacy because it does not take into consideration real world viewing situations, such as surfaces, textures and surround contexts variations. It was suggested that many colour vision mechanisms only become active when there is sufficient variation and context in the light, which cannot be captured by ratio matches. Instead Jameson et al, (2001) asked participants to identify spectral delineations for a diffracted spectral stimulus. Although this is not entirely reflective of real world viewing conditions, it does offer more variability to the retina than simple ratio matching techniques. It was found from this that heterozygous carriers of the two types of red opsin, delineated more bands of colour in the diffracted spectrum than a control group of non heterozygous trichromatic females. This removes any differences that may be attributed to gender (Jameson et al, 2001) and also implies that the two groups of females are experiencing different perceptions of colour. This also suggests that the heterozygous carriers are experiencing strong tetrachromacy and that their visual system is utilising the fourth photopsin. This evidence demonstrates a stronger tendency for heterozygous females to exhibit tetrachromatic colour vision than Jordan and Mollen (1993) found, and it is likely that this is a more sensitive measure of colour perception. It also suggests that the viewing experiences of women who have the propensity to be tetrachromatic, in this case, is more advanced than women who are not heterozygous than expected by Jordan and Mollen (1993).
