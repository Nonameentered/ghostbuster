This last case highlights the possibility of complete misidentification of a suspect in the absence of false memories, and also the power of real eyewitness accounts. Bernard Webster was misidentified by 3 eyewitnesses even though he did not resemble any of the original descriptions. It appears that the majority of wrongful convictions due to eyewitness misidentification arise from poorly conducted line-ups (Wells, 1993). For example, in the case of Bernard Webster, it appeared a photo-biased line-up was in part to blame for his wrong conviction. Webster was sentenced to life in 1982 for a rape committed in 1966, on the account of three mistaken identifications. All three of the eyewitnesses had failed to identify him in a pre-trial photo line-up, leading to his removal from the official line-up. The victim had been raped in her apartment, during which the rapist was reported to be much more muscular and that his hair was longer than the suspects. However, during the line-up, a detective suggested the victim pick out the suspect based on his eyes, a previous description used.
