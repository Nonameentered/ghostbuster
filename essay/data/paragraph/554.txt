Diabetes is a condition characterised by abnormally high levels of glucose in the bloodstream which reduces life expectancy by a median of twelve years (Mangel referenced in 13) and affects sixteen million people in the USA (12). The development of this disease can be classified as either type one or type two (1). Type one diabetes, or juvenile-onset diabetes, is an autoimmune condition in which self-pancreatic cells are targeted by immune cells and are destroyed. As a result the islets of the pancreas are unable to secrete insulin in the presence of glucose. Type two diabetes is generally associated with older, overweight individuals and develops when the body cannot use insulin effectively (1). In both cases the result of this disease causes excessive glucose accumulation in the blood which can lead to further complications such as blindness and heart failure.
