The final group vulnerable to unemployment are ethnic minorities, however it should be noted that this category needs to be disaggregated, as unemployment is especially significant for Afro-Caribbean's and Bangladeshi workers, but does not affect Asian workers, especially those from India or China, to the same extent. Pissarides and Wadsworth have identified this group as vulnerable, however, saying; 'race has a large effect on unemployment' (1992, p66). Statistics show that by 1986 the rate of white unemployment was 9.1% compared to 15.1% for non-whites (Pissarides and Wadsworth, 1992, p66). More recently Coles found that those identifying themselves as black were twice as likely to be unemployed (1995, p40).
