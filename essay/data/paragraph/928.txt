Initial data screening using a boxplot indicated that there were four outliers in the raw data. One had a particularly low score on the 'planful problem solving scale', one on the 'seeking social support' scale, and the other two particularly high scores on the 'self isolation' scale. The data from these subjects was subsequently removed from the study due to the potential disproportionate influence they may have had on results obtained. All analysis was carried out with these outliers removed. There was no missing data in the data set.
