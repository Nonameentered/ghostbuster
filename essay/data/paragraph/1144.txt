The authoritarian personality is a personality type that predisposes a person to obey unquestionably. People with this personality type are said to be prejudice against minority groups and believe strongly in obeying authority. They also have a general belief in the importance of power and dominance, and the insignificance of those below them. This is because they feel weak and therefore feel they need to be part of a powerful group and have a powerful leader.
