Such research indicates at what age a child best understands scientific rules involved in separate disciplines in science, namely biology and physics. It also demonstrates that concepts are, in fact, comprehended at different ages. For example, one would assume that the experiments of Massey and Gelman (1988) and Rosengren et al (1991) are linked, as they both entail a sound knowledge of the principles of biology, specifically features of animate and inanimate life. However, the onset of understanding occurs at age four in the former research but at age five in the latter, showing that cognitive development occurs more as a function of concept than of domain. This illustrates how the Piagetian premise of domain generality can work against the cognitive progression of the primary school aged child.
