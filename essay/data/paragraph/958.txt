Behaviour therapy is often used as a form of treatment for psychological disorders. It is based on the principles of behaviourism and attempts to modify behaviour by using conditioning to encourage a desired behaviour and discourage an undesired behaviour. It involves techniques such as Systematic Desensitization, In Vivo Exposure and Modeling. Systematic Desensitization as founded by Wolpe (1958) is a type of behaviour therapy based on classical conditioning in which a person is exposed to increasing levels of the fear-producing stimuli until the fear is extinguished. In this method, a patient is exposed to a feared stimulus and taught relaxation techniques in order to manage the anxiety associated with it. This method has yielded amazing results for many patients suffering from phobias and anxiety disorders. However, it is essentially the same as a form of behaviour modification as it is teaching the patient to respond in a way that is desired by the therapist. Additionally, this method has been criticised as it does not address the real issue behind the fear and there has been no evidence to suggest that this method is actually correcting the underlying problem but merely teaching the patient to suppress their fear.
