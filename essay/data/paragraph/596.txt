The main reservoir of these virulent bacteria is biofilms and amoebae, which protect these organisms from the hostile environment and environmental biocides, hence providing the perfect environment for these virulent strains to replicate. As these trends continue, understanding the virulence factors of Legionella species becomes evermore important, not only in developing a vaccine or biocide regime, but also in understanding the organisations defence mechanisms to such infections. With this knowledge the incidence of Such outbreaks can possibly be brought under control.
