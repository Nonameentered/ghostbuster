Overall the results proved significant and can be explained by current memory research, including theories of verbal rehearsal and short term memory displacement. The findings mean that the actual conditions during the encoding stage of memory are just as important if not more so than conditions during retrieval. This information has many implications in the fields of learning and memory. Obviously in the classroom adjustments can be made to optimise learning, for instance if a teacher talks about a topic whilst her pupils are trying to read or write about the same topic there may be confusion: the best conditions for learning are without background noise, so it is advisable for the teacher to talk first and allow the class to listen, then to let the class learn in silence or with unrelated background noise such as music or quiet conversation. In informative presentations and training the same can be said; if slides or handouts are being read whilst the speaker gives related information verbally, memory can be impaired. When trying to learn information it is better to focus on one source at a time than to try to absorb facts from a number of sources simultaneously. This can of course be tested using varied conditions and other senses.
