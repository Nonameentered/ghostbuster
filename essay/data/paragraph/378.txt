These themes, depicting powerlessness, along with the pervasive images of hopelessness and fear, as well as the macabre spectres of death and destruction, as is plain to see, meant that subversive bomb films never fared well at the box office. Effectively buried by the Hays Office and censorship, these films were never meant to be granted a long life. As Robert Rosenstone has noted 'the utility of history and film can never be judged merely by their power to evoke an imagined past'. Filmmakers have a responsibility to make credible films that provoke audience engagement and understanding. Although more limited in the potential for social relevance, these films remain pertinent today. For example, commenting on American hubris, Cord Scott in The film, in presenting war as a video game with its attendant desensitisation to destruction, emanates a resolve that is, sadly, as valid today as it was in 1964.
