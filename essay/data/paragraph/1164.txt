Qualitative research can also play a primary role in hypothesis generation without the need to appeal to a post modernist philosophy, which questions the need for set criteria exists in judging the products of qualitative research (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994, as cited in Merrick, 1993). In theoretical sciences the depth of knowledge from past experiments and theories constrain the choice of sensible hypotheses (Burt & Oaksfield, 1999). Therefore it is suggested, that in the light of recent views that considering psychology as a science, we need qualitative research to fill the gap in relation to the lack of theories. Qualitative methods systemize and give structure to the process of hypothesis generation. The resulting hypothesis can then be subject to objective testing in a truly scientific way. However we do have to be aware that it is difficult to conduct objective experimental tests using qualitative research. People may not always be willing or comfortable with sharing their experiences with the experimenter. In this case, it may be more appropriate to change the type of verbal report used. For example, people may feel more at ease verbally expressing their feelings in the form of writing.
