It is now necessary to examine the impact of consumption patterns on class. It can be opined that humans today are defined not by their relationship to the means of production but by the goods that they purchase in a world of increasing material fetishism. Consumption, therefore, becomes an independent dimension of social stratification and distinction. With humans self-consciously measuring themselves under the slogan, 'I am what I buy' rather than ' I am what I work', class is apparently consigned to the rubbish bin of history. This can potentially upset not only sociological thinking on today's society but also ways in which historians have understood social groups in the past. In his portrait of common Parisian life before 1789, Daniel Roche shows a wider world of rich materialism, thereby suggesting a possible review of the pre-Revolutionary social categorisation dynamics that led to the regime change. However, consumption remains inherently joined to the hip of class. For example, the nouveaux riches cannot necessarily look for a concomitant entry into the traditional halls of upper class society. This may be for 'snobbery' reasons (the 'my mother would not invite yours home for tea' adage) or through failure to adopt the values of their new class, as expressed in Marx's idea of 'false consciousness'.
