In this case, a poorly conducted line-up led to 3 people misidentifying Webster, including the victim, despite him being 8 inches shorter than their original descriptions. It has been proposed that, when selecting a suspect out of a line-up, people undertake a relative judgement process and choose the person most resembling the culprit relative to others in the line-up (Wells, 1984). It is possible that as the initial photo-line-up did not show any conceptions of height, and also as the original descriptions were vague; the witnesses may have resorted to relative judgements in the line-up. This identification could have then led to a subsequent photo-biased line-up, in which the witnesses identified Webster as he was the only one present in both line-ups (Loftus, 1996). This familiarity, like the process of unconscious transference, may then be mistakenly related back to the crime rather than the photo line-up, (Loftus, 1996).
