Nikolai Lenin  When the Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, seized power in the October revolution of 1917, their vision of a truly democratic state and society was replaced by a reality of mass terror and oppression of civil rights and freedom. With the fall of the Soviet Union, the influence of these revolutionary thinkers has been greatly diminished. However, Lenin's ideas on democracy had already been distorted to the point of nullity under the rule of Joseph Stalin.  Stalin inherited the task of holding together a psychologically unhappy Soviet Union. He was determined to force change, through his version of 'building socialism in one country'. Convincing large sections, as Lenin had done, that 'the new society can be built only by the masses, it is the task of a party to prepare and train the masses for this great historic work,' Stalin seemed to have a clear concept of revolution and mass control. However, it quickly became clear that his idea of 'building socialism in one country' was nothing more than a mask for a more autocratic form of government. Stalin's belief that the 'bureaucracy' and bureaucracy's particular approach to problem-solving was authoritative replaced the revolutionary spirit of the October revolution.
