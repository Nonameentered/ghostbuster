As selective attention studies have shown attentional processes to also facilitate numerous other cognitive activities (e.g. language, memory and problem solving) it is clear that attentional deficits affect many aspects of the lives of older people. Therefore, it would be beneficial to use models of cognitive processes to help understand and improve the interactions between older adults and their environments (McDowd & Shaw, 2000). Research into to selective attention can also aid us in helping older adults with their day-to day tasks, such as by enhancing their interactions with technology (McDowd & Shaw, 2000), for example, by minimising excessive 'distractor' items in a visual display, or by providing environmental support to facilitate attentional processes, as cues are often found to reduce age differences in selective attention (Shaw, 1991). It is clear that the most important findings arising from selective attention studies are the theories that have contributed to numerous explanations for many aspects of cognitive ageing in general.
