The number of people affected by dementia does not end with the patients. Current research is increasingly showing that these numbers are severe underestimates, as dementia affects almost all people a patient interacts with (Gilliard, 2001). In fact, the sheer amount of literature on caregiver well-being aptly demonstrates the profound psychological effects on the caregiver as well. The psychological effects on both patients and caregivers appear to be causal and heavily overlap, that is to say, the psychological effects on the patient tend also to have corresponding psychological effects on the caregiver and vice versa. Therefore, I propose that in order to extend our understanding of dementia, we should work towards a more integrated focus, exploring the links between the effects on the patient and the carer. This essay will discuss the psychological effects of dementia on the patient and the caregiver and the impact of these effects on one another, using Alzheimer's disease (AD) as my primary example.
