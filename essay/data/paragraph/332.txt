The Figure is extremely useful in that it provides a snapshot of the air strength the Air Ministry hoped for in its 1920s conception of air strength. On the face of it, the proposal of 68 squadrons in home defence, plus 51 for imperial defence - as proposed in the March estimate - appears to demonstrate the Air Ministry idealism for creating a credible air arm, stretching to all corners of the Empire. However, this desire was clearly strained within a backdrop of economic retrenchment. These 68 squadrons far exceed the 55 suggested earlier by the Committee of Imperial Defence, hinting at officer pressure for a larger force; this is further evidenced by the Chief of the Air Staff's terse remark 'we wish to turn our swords into ploughshares, but not so fast'. It bears remembers that it was the need to create sufficient 'shock effect' and the RAF's mission to be flexible to meet imperial needs simultaneously, which propelled the Air Ministry to make such proposals. Within such a framework, the Officer's scheme appears to prioritise imperial over home defence numbers - with the latter coming off better in the end -in disagreeance with contemporary historians, who often argue that the home defence was the undoubted priority in 1920s British air strategy. V Admittedly, it nevertheless remains debatable to what extent the Air Ministry would have been able to find resources and personnel for these grand schemes. We have no evidence to suggest how many of the proposed squadrons were operational or to what profile they operated. And indeed, the proposed air strength may well have been seen as a best -case scenario, designed to secure a better financial settlement. Above all, the Figure is perhaps most revealing, not just of the proposed air strength, but in its implication of the Air Ministry outlook in the early 1920s.
