It is clear that the earlier optimism of the Air Staff proved ephemeral, as air service expenditure initially sharply fell, and then remained relatively austere. The Figure supports existing discourse about air strategy, which contends that the RAF just about 'held on' during its cradle days, in the face of ferocious economic retrenchment, the Ten-Year Rule and a zetheist that condemned recourse to conflict. The impact of the imposed permanent war planning blight, is particularly evident if we note the acute fall in Technical and Warlike Stores estimates in the Appendix - elements that constitute the kernel of aggressive air strength - from It is also significant to note from that source that research was particularly barren throughout the period, falling from This goes a long way in explaining the poor quality of aircraft the RAF possessed as late as 1934, still consisting of inchoate wooden biplanes. The data also reveal that air strategy was far from a blueprinted plan, and was in fact often pragmatic and respondent to changes in geopolitik. For example, the slight rise in expenditure in 1924 can be seen as a direct response to the perceived threat of the Arm However, the data has limitations that prevent a challenge to the existing historiography. They give no indication of how many planes were actually produced or what important fields of operation fared better than others. How far was the empire really given wings as the Chief of the Air Staff had proposed in 1918? They also do not offer any information on the Army and Navy, against which to draw priority comparisons; and industrial capacity is unknown.
