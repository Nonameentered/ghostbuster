The next source of stem cells is ES, which are obtained from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst stage embryo (3). ES cells, like EC cells, are pluripotent and can form numerous cell types, however a key difference between the two lies in the mechanism of their production. As previously mentioned, ES derive from the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst, which of course requires the destruction of an embryo in order to be harvested, as a result causing significant ethical issues. In addition to this, the derivation of EC cells requires a virally induced malignancy, making them more of an ethical concern and therefore ES are favoured for research purposes.
