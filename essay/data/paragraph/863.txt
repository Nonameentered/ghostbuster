Huntley and Costanzo's (2003) finding that different people can create different stories for the same evidence is widely supported however (Stephenson, 1995), and this is where the research is relevant in creating the implications for the deliberation process. Holstein (1985) investigated the effect of story generation on juries and the deliberation process and found that the higher the number of individual stories that were propagated into the deliberation process, the less likely the jury was to return a unanimous verdict. Holstein (1985) demonstrated that as deliberation increased the additional interpretations of the evidence, the task became more complex. This implies that if people do not initially have stories based upon similar assumptions, then the deliberation process is not going to largely alter people's stories, and it is this that makes the deliberation process more complex and a unanimous verdict less likely (Holstein, 1985). Holstein (1985) also found that even when people have two different stories favouring the same verdict, if the underlying assumptions are different, this still reduces the ability of the jury to reach a unanimous verdict and increases the complexity of the deliberation.
