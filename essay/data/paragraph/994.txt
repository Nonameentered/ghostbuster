Researches on different engines which usually used in racing were performed and discussed in this report. Engine used for general automotives was internal combustion (I.C.) engine in which the mechanical power of vehicle was produced by combustion of fuel within the combustion chamber. Internal combustion engine could have either two-strokes or four-strokes and either spark ignites or compression ignites. Gasoline, diesel and natural gas could be selected as the fuel in a SI engine.
