To the enlightened mind, 'luxury' became seen as the formative principles of art and culture. Chinese luxury goods were particularly suitable in this regard because their 'foreignness' provided a useful backdrop- a reversal of the perception that the Orient was the East- that is of being "less refined", that foreign luxury goods remedied these 'deficiencies', and allowed one to access a higher refinement of taste; one that was not attainable within Europe or their culture. This aesthetic ideal was further moulded through extensive marketing by the East India companies, which through ingenious marketing strategies further encouraged the European fascination with Chinese luxury goods. Thus, it was through customisation and the moralisation of luxury that sparked the booming demand for these imported goods.
