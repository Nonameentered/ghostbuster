In the twenty five years following the Second World War the government was fully committed to full employment, however in the 1970s unemployment began to rise drastically (Vickerstaff, 2003). The number of unemployed rose from 1.3 million in 1979 to 3 million in 1982 (Jones and Novak, 1999, p39, Glynn, 1999, p190), and as Burnett notes these figures remained high throughout the 1980s and 1990s (1994). However although unemployment has always existed in periods of history before, this increase was significant, as new patterns emerged, with rising youth and ethnic minority unemployment, and unemployment concentrated in certain areas of the country (Ashton and Maguire, 1991). In this essay I will briefly outline why mass unemployment emerged at this time, including factors of global changes, technological advances and government policies. I will then move on to examine which groups were most at risk from these changes, looking closely at the young, those in industrial towns, men, especially the unskilled, and finally ethnic minorities, and exploring the reasons why they were so vulnerable. I will not look at several other groups who were also vulnerable; those with disabilities, few qualifications and the elderly, as they had been at risk from unemployment before, and it was not the situation in the 1970s that caused this risk, as it was with the groups I will look at.
