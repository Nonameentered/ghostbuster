Another factor which may contribute to first year students having significantly more disordered eating than their control group involves the aspects which university brings. Firstly university entails leaving home, sometimes for the first time, and living without parental supervision. This may lead to more stress, depression and eventually disordered eating when teenagers are suddenly faced with the responsibility and independence of living away from home. Vanderlinden et al (2001) found that about 30% of students were suffering with depression, and that disordered on or more eating attitudes are eight times more likely in those with depression. It may be that university simply highlights already existing tendencies, or factors before university, which individuals are not even aware of, and resort to disordered eating as a coping technique when depression or stress peaks. University may, in some cases, lead to the development of disordered eating, but it is likely that the individuals already had easier tendencies to develop these patterns and that living away from home provides an opportunity to do this. University also entails a lack of structure and increase in freedom. For those with disordered eating patterns, there are no constraints or rules which may lead individuals to abusing this freedom and perpetuating their disordered patterns (Gordon, 1990).
