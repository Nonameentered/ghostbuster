The idea of behaviourism has been around for a long time but was made famous by the work of Ivan Pavlov. He conditioned the behaviour of dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell by repeatedly associating the ring of a bell with presentation of food. B. F. Skinner extended this idea whilst working with pigeons to show that animals could be trained to perform various acts in order to get food, as long as the association was made between food and the desired response. Skinner always recommended positive reinforcement such as rewards over negative reinforcement or punishment, (Eysenck, 2002). Such ideas have gradually leaked into the classroom, to increase desired behaviour from children, and even into the National Health Service, to attempt to 'cure' psychological disorders.
