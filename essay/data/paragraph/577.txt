In general, when a host organism becomes infected, it is the job of both the innate and humoral immune responses to clear that infection.  Even with the presence of specific antibodies there is little increase of monocytic bactericidal activity. Horwitzal. (13, reviewed in 1) demonstrated this by incubating serum- resistant encapsulated It was observed that the number of colony forming units (CFUs) decreased by 2.5 logs. Another similar treatment reduced These data therefore indicate that complement, specific antibodies and polymorphonuclear cells cannot resolve infection and therefore partly account for the ability of
