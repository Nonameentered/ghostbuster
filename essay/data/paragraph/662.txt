The behaviouristic approach to learning and education to ensure good behaviour has also been popular. It is a common opinion in the teaching profession that rewards for desirable behaviour, such as wall charts and stickers, act as a strong incentive to pupils and help to encourage learning. Teaching time is also kept to the bare minimum, with animations and pictures used in the place of long informative words, keeping children's attention and ensuring understanding. Some teachers have also attempted to understand particular disturbances and behavioural problems in their pupils and have designed helpful classroom situations to ease them. Although this is very important, such approach is only a short-term solution and doesn't address the cause of such behaviour, or look into any underlying psychological problems, (Kearney, 1998). Similarly programmed instruction attempts to teach people by breaking tasks down into steps and presents a pre-determined reward or reinforcement if the task is completed. In practice though, this can create confusion and emotion as the subject may not know what is supposed to happen at each step. This can prove to be very difficult for children with learning difficulties, as reinforcements tend to be given before understanding is achieved, and it can often give the wrong impression if the correct answers are not understood, (Smithal, 1980).
