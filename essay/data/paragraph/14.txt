The most commonly expressed limitation of the use of official statistics in sociology is due to the issues of reliability and validity of the results. Traditional positivists believe that sociology should use the scientific method, and Aristotle's 'true measures', to collect data which can later be analysed to draw conclusions (May, 1997). The main problem with official statistics is however, that they go through many processes of decision making before the final results are even produced. These decisions, and the different ways in which people can interpret concepts can have a huge effect on the actual results of the statistics.
