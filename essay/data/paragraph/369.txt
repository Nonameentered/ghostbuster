Asserting 'I'm not working for the world. I'm working for the Air Force', Hendry begins as the archetypal wheel-in-machine conformist, who cannot blow his nose without clearing it first with Headquarters. For example, using standard procedure to free an alien ship, Hendry accidentally blows it up. Hendry is actually immobilised by bureaucracy, stating 'until I receive my instructions from my superior officers, we'll have to mark time'. However, as we have shown, SF films were anything but unanimous in agreement.  It argues that society should embrace the organization man culture and posits that to leave the group is to be beyond the safe parameters of society. All the victims succumb when they leave the confines of the group. Furthermore, it takes a consortium of scientists, police and soldiers to defeat the ants.
