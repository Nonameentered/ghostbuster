Stalin's rivals all made mistakes in their quest for political gain.Trotsky failed to attend important meetings and was accused of wanting too much power to himself, Bukharin kept quiet during the debates, Zinoviev and Kamenev did not make Trotsky the potential scapegoat of the party and all of them failed to act upon Lenin's wishes to 'split the jaws of Stalin' in December 1922. This mutually destructive tendency enabled Stalin to accumulate enough opposition to secure his elevation to General Secretary and then to his overthrowing the whole system and all its occupants as well as the small amount of checks on his power.
