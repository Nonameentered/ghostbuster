That said, Simmel's fundamental aim in view of this model of the metropolis was to arrive at a definition of the 'social forms' that may be associated with it, describing them as a specific approach to 'the nexus of things social', which for him consists of the 'intellectual operations of the individual mind' (Simmel 1971b: 328). A 'philosophically neutral' (Simmel 1971b: 329) approach to social forms hence emerges from his writing on the metropolis in the sense that one needs to take away 'the materials of the social sciences from their practical materiality in order to treat them as factors of abstract logic' (Simmel 1971b: 333); that is, form and content must be separated, and the content of each form must be analysed as a single concept from within the social sphere. Simmel explicitly sided with the method of abstracting the content from the recurrences of experiences (Simmel 1971b: 333), which lead him to speak of the '"formal" conditions of a "socially" significant attitude' (Simmel 1971b: 334).
