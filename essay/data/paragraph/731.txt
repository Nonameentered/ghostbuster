State attitude towards irrigation was also due to ecological constraints in East Asia. Demographic changes were of much greater concern in the East than Europe, as it was experiencing a period of rapid population growth- in 1750 Japan had a population of approximately twenty eight million, and the Chinese population grew from approximately 100-150 million in 1650, to 200-250 million by 1750 This increase created a rapidly escalating need for food, therefore the states' primary concern was provision rather than profit. Demographic growth was also somewhat self-perpetuating; increased demand for food necessitated extra manpower for cultivation. This created a culture in which early marriage and many children were encouraged, which led to yet more food and therefore manpower being needed. As P.H.H. Vries notes 'China's internal transport with its densely knit system of waterways probably was the most efficient in the world' Efficiency was essential, and therefore demography hampered the East Asia's chances of large-scale commercialisation and industrialisation more than the environment itself. Landes emphasises climatic differences too fervently, for it was resulting ecological constraints the state's response and that hindered economic progress. As the next section explains, East Asia was able to overcome natural disadvantage through technology; however, their success was brief, for technical superiority highlighted problems similar to those posed by state control over water.
