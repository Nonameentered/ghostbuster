METHOD  PARTICIPANTS  The participants in the study were 23 first year female students aged 18-19 years, and 23 control females aged 18-19 years. Subjects for the experimental group were selected from two different university campuses, one in Bolton and one in London. The London campus was a performing arts university and the Bolton campus was a non performing arts university. Selecting university students from possibly two different backgrounds was important to make sure there was no response bias present. There was an almost even split between the number of participants from the two universities, with 11 participants from Bolton and London respectively.  Controls were matched to the experimentals with regards to age, gender, race and location. The closest university to the control group was Liverpool university so it provided a good match of socio-economic standing and the age group for the experimentals without being too close geographically. Control participants were asked at the beginning of the study to state whether they liked very much or had been to either Bolton or London university, and if they had been simply to visit or if they knew current students from either of the universities. All controls stated they had not been to either university and none knew current students, which was reassuring that no main effects of the university were present due to previous visits or personal convictions.  MATERIALS  To measure behaviour and attitudes to eating, body shape, and self-esteem / peer group influences the Eating Attitude Test (EAT), the Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ), and a revised version of the Self-Esteem Rating Scale (SERS) were used. The EAT was predominated by participants' evaluation of food and their thoughts on their eating behaviour (Garner, Olmsted and Polivy, 1983). The BSQ was employed to measure
