Another consequence of damage to the fusiform gyrus is prosopagnosia; this is a disorder where the patient is unable recognise faces. Patients can identify faces but they do not recognise whose face is present before them, they may not even recognise their own face in the mirror. Prosopagnosia involves both the temporal and parietal lobes but mainly originates from damage to the fusiform gyrus. Even though patients have difficulty in recognising faces there is a marked difference if a face is made psychologically 'stronger' by for example, presenting faces that are linked. Patients with prosopagnosia may also have difficulty in distinguishing between particular objects of the same class, e.g. makes of cars (Physiology Of Behaviour, 1991, p.187).
