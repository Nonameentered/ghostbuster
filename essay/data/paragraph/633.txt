The assumption that a gap existed between the theory and the practice in the social position of women between 1500 and 1700 is a contested one. Margaret Ezell argues that the expectations of female behaviour and duty in society did infact closely match the reality of women's experiences. Looking at contemporary literature and popular opinion, Ezell concludes that contrary to many historians who view the prescribed position as restrictive and misogynistic, both scripture and conduct books infact highlighted female capabilities and praised women as 'Differences between men and women are merely superficial...women are as naturally capable as men of reason, wit and...government." However, feminists have criticised Ezell for her limited interpretation of the literature she looks at.
