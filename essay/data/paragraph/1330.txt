In relation to science teaching one may suggest that the findings from such experiments may call for the introduction of subject-driven teaching, as opposed to curriculum-driven teaching. It could be argued that by tailoring the science curriculum to the age which cognitively characterises the best learning of a particular concept, children will start to understand the complexities of science much better. For example, the research of Inagaki and Sukiyama (1988), concerning the attribution of properties, suggests that the parents of four- to five year-olds should be made aware of this fact, and talked to about these basic principles early on. This would build an adequate base for their further education about the material world.
