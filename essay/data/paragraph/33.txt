However it was not the only significant impact. Another major implication was the way in which women were depicted by the medical profession. As men wished to justify their exclusion of women from medicine, they redefined how women were viewed. As well continuing to portray them as too emotional to enter what they saw as the world of science, men also began to associate women's bodies with evil, claiming they were inherently dangerous, and therefore needed controlling (Smart, 1992). This would ensure that women were unable to enter medical profession, but also that men could retain control over women's bodies. However at the same time they also depicted women as frail, and therefore dependant upon the male medical practice (Moscucci, 1990, Smart, 1992). Both of these depictions ensured that women were unable to enter medicine, and guaranteed that it remained a male dominated profession.
