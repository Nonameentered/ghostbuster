The study of Bomb Cinema can tell us much about the culture of the Cold War. As the foregoing has suggested, these films did not shy from their critical evaluations of the US approach to the Cold War. Released in 1967, at the apex of the Cold War, and during the wider countercultural questioning of the Vietnam War, The Directors, particularly Kubrick, used these films to caricature the military-technical elite and thumb their nose at the military-industrial complex, which dominated the American approach to the Cold War. However, there was more to them than rebelliousness. As a consequence of the unequal distribution of power in the Cold War, Bomb Cinema also made a telling point on the apparent helplessness of the individual.
