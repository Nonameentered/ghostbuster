To conclude, there is a considerable body of evidence suggesting that emotion affects our memory, both in terms of its encoding and subsequent accessibility when later retrieving information from memory. The observation of flashbulb memories has demonstrated how emotionally intense events can be encoded in strong and vivid memories. In contrast, theories of repression suggest that powerful negative emotions can lead to repression of memories, or may cause people to forget embarrassing or painful events. Similarly, mood congruent retrieval highlights how emotional states may affect the recall of affectively congruent information, whilst theories of mood-state-dependent learning suggest that when people are in the same mood as at the time of encoding, memories are then more easily retrievable. In order to explain these effects, Bower put forward associative network theory, adapted later to include the causal belonging hypothesis.
