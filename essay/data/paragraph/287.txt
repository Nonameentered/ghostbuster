This essay will argue that sporting practices are intimately bound up with the social construction of masculine ideals, and that the relationship between sport and society provides crucial insights into the other societal forces that contribute to the forms these ideals take. A central concept that will be employed throughout will be the concept of hegemonic masculinity. Masculine ideals as they exist in contemporary society will be conceptualised throughout the essay as forming the analytical tool that is hegemonic masculinity. Hegemonic masculinity can be described as occupying the dominant position in the gender order of society; this is very different to a conventional patriarchal view of society that argues all men are dominant over all women. Rather, the concept of hegemonic masculinity and the gender order proposes that the dominant force in gender relations is a particular kind of masculinity that has developed cultural primacy; consequently, all alternative masculinities and all femininities are subordinated and become involved in a dynamic relationship in which the power of the hegemonic masculinity has to adapt and evolve in order to retain its dominance. Therefore, this essay will attempt to deconstruct the concept of hegemonic masculinity into some of its constituent masculine ideals through discussing the role of sporting practices in ensuring the dominance of males over females; reinforcing the normality of heterosexuality; marginalising black males; and in emphasising the importance of physical prowess in order to show how sporting practices contribute to the stability of hegemonic masculinity itself. The essay begins, however, with an evaluation of perspectives that argue the development of institutionalised sporting practices was unaffected by issues of masculinity.
