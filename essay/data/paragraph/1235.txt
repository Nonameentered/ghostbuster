Studies examining the effects of aging on selective attention have revealed various age-related deficits, although the theories associated with them are vast. One such theory is the generalised-slowing hypothesis, which suggests that age-related cognitive decline is due to information processing being globally and proportionately slowed (Salthouse, 1991). The findings of early visual search research were based on this theory (Rabbitt, 1965), as it was found that increasing the display size had a greater effect on older adults implying that age differences are more pronounced during more complex tasks (Madden & Whiting, 2004).
