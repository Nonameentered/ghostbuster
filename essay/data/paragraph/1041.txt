An interesting development would be that of the counter-monument. This is particularly so with regard to the new generation of German artists, who 'have a deep distrust of monumental forms in light of their systematic exploitation by the Nazis, and a profound desire to distinguish their generation from that of the killers through memory." These artists explore both the necessity of memory, and their incapacity to recall events they never experienced directly, hence in capturing the memory of events, remember therefore only their own relationship to it. The Gerzes' counter-monument is perhaps the best example of this. Theirs is a self-abnegating monument, a 'vanishing monument' which, instead of graciously accepting the burden of memory, throws it back at the town's feet, forcing them to remember for themselves. This audaciously simple idea challenges the idea of monumentality and the permanence of collective memory, and provokes the population to examine themselves as part of the piece's performance.
