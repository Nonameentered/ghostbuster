It has been proposed that the presence of others can either be an energising factor or a source of inhibition, or a combination of the two. This theory is seen in the findings of Geen and Gange (1977), Seta, Paulus and Schkade (1976), and Zajonc, Wolosin, Wolosin and Loh (1970). They found that performance of an individual was related to how many people were present, and that the presence of others made participants more conservative in the tasks they chose or the ways they went about them. This insight comes from social facilitation, and was initially suggested by Allport (1920). The idea of competition and rivalry has been tested many times since the study of Triplett (1898). A plethora of studies have suggested that the presence of an opposing individual or group can increase performance, however the impact of the size of that group of people has largely been overlooked. In addition to this, research (Fairhurst and Sargeant, 1969; Williams and Rink, 1971) has suggested that response times to an action are shorter when the action is performed in the presence of other people than when it is performed alone. The findings of Geen and Gange (1977) also demonstrate that the presence of other people obliterates risk-taking behaviour. This is enlightening in the realm of behaviour, especially risky behaviour usually associated with the presence of others. The findings of Robinson-Staveley and
