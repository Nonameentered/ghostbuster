The USSR collapse is seen by many as the fundamental nail in the coffin of Marxist class theories. Joyce believes that any mention of class automatically locks us into a set of discourses belonging only to discredited Stalinists and a failed socialist project. Class for Joyce is made solely of Soviet clay. This is indicative of a post-communist age, where all forms of socialism and class have been brought into question, and tarred with the same brush. However, class has long been pluralistic in form, and attacking only the most discredited type of class is only 'scoring easy polemical points' Indeed, advocates of this approach are mounting simply an ideological, rather than empirically justifiable, charge. Although recognising that orthodox Marxist class theory, and socialism as the telos of history, does look a little dated, class is more fluid than this attack would have us believe.
