The publication of This comes mostly from its assumed political incorrectness, claimed implications for public policy, and doubts from the scientific community as to its scientific claims (Keenan 1999). In this essay I shall attempt to take a closer look at some sociologically significant conclusions reached in the book. It seems, however, impossible to review the book without references to the sharp criticism it sparked upon publication. I shall therefore occasionally refer to critics or related academic work.
