The French Revolution of 1871 and the Paris Commune of 1871 opened the eyes of Marx and Engels to the importance of immediate action, yet also convinced them of the theoretical deficiencies of a pure democracy to lead to socialism. Marx and Engels thus argued that democracy only partially assured the elimination of class differences; 'The Communards have no ready-made utopias to introduce by decree of the people at one stroke'. Finally, Marx and Engels realised that no revolution could be made to succeed without a strong and dedicated organisation: 'Only the organisation of the proletarians into a class, and consequently into a political party, can turn the first steps of the proletarian movement into a really revolutionary movement'.  Lenin's ideas on the dictatorship of the proletariat and his contribution to a theory of a revolutionary government  With the death of Marx in 1883, a repository of theoretical ideas was left to be filled by his successor. Broadly, Russia was shaken and contemporaries called out for revolutionary leadership to govern. Lenin, alongside other revolutionary contemporaries, answered this desperate call.  Lenin was born in Russia in 1870 and soon became an adherent to the revolutionary ideals of Marx and Engels. Even by the age of twelve, Lenin wrote in a school newspaper of his belief that 'the stronger will always trample over the weaker'. In his twenties, Lenin refined this thought to believe that only a socialist system in which the majority of people would be in control of the government could do justice to the historical struggle between the classes. Thus, like Marx, Lenin assumed that a period of dictatorship of the proletariat would lead society out of its capitalist bondage. The practical implementation of Marxist theories was seen to be likely in the almost autocratic conditions of tsarist Russia.
