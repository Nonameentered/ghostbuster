There have been relatively consistent findings regarding the effects of group decision making compared with individual decision making. Groups tend to polarize towards the given majority and individuals often become more extreme in their preferences after the group discussion compared to before (Myers and Kaplan, 1976). The mediating mechanism operating between the pre and the post decision is the deliberation process. Deliberation has a large impact on jury decision making, which is reliant upon individual jurors discussing the evidence as a group, and returning with an often unanimous verdict. The majority of research on the jury has focused upon how individual jurors reach a verdict before the discussion, such as studies supporting the Story Board Model of juror decision making (Pennington and Hastie, 1992). Although this is a theory investigating how the individual decides upon a verdict, it does have implications for the deliberation process. There have also been attempts to produce Social Decision Schemes to assess the probability of deliberation resulting in a guilty, not guilty or hung verdict, depending upon pre deliberation verdicts (Davis, Kerr, Stasser, Meek and Holt, 1977). Although both offer reasonable attempts to explain or predict jury decision making, neither provide a complete theory of the deliberation process.
