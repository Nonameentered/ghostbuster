In the attempt to introduce wheat to the indigenous Latin American people, the attempt was less successful than that of introducing meat or vegetables. Wheat was eaten by Europeans as a main source of sustenance and added variety to an Old World diet, but for Americans its superior nutritional value to local staples such as maize was negligible and it was only partially accepted by indigenous cultures. As Crosby notes ' maize remained the basis of the Indian diet in any region where it could be grown' Indian diets were already based upon starchy staples, often accompanied by wild fruits and vegetables, and thus the taste, growth and cooking time of the product were far more important than a supposedly superior nutritional value. Foods such as wheat were produced on a large scale and intended for commercial sale, as it was far easier to transport and store than perishable goods and were also of much greater value to European colonies. As Crosby claims 'the Spanish did not believe that Indian slaves would labour at anything but the most basic task, and they saw little utility in attempting to transform their diet from its traditional primitive level to a wholly or partially European one' As the industrial revolution had yet to occur and labour was done largely by hand, it was to the advantage of Spanish settlers to continue the traditional consumption of maize and other indigenous staples. These trends continued into the eighteenth century, when European overproduction was a factor in agricultural decline in Latin America 'as plants and animals were shipped back to Europe, sometimes in vast quantities, critical resources remained in short supply for Latin American farmers' and the primary crop remained maize for consumption by natives as well as for export and Industrial production
