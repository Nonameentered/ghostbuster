To express and symbolise their newly won freedom and nationhood, popular culture started to play a bigger role. The traditional corrido, a ballad-like song style, turned into tales of revolution. Moreover, it integrated local elements like rural music forms, and had its origins in an illegal colonial tradition already. The ballad evolved further under the influence of the Americans into the corrido; a very popular, often longer, tale of heroes and villains, like the American western.
