Haemagglutination is an agglutination of red blood cells (RBC) or particles due to binding of viruses, bacteria and other cell types to specific receptors. Haemagglutination is also used as a means to identify and quantify the number of virus particles in a solution or to determine the quantity of specific antibodies present in a serum. In this experiment, haemagglutination was used to determine the HA titre and HI titre. The HA titre is the amount of virus required to cause haemagglutination and the HI titre is the amount of antibody present to just prevent haemagglutination.
