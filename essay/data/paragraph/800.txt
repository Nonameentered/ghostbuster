Eating disorders are becoming an increasing problem. The concept of the thin body ideal is being internalised through the social setting and causing more people, particularly adolescent females, to resort to severe dieting techniques (Markham, Thompson, Bowling, 2005). Unhealthy eating attitudes are an immensely important area of research as it has been shown that up to 20% of young women participate in intense dieting practices at some point in their lives (Kurth, Krahn, Nain and Drewnowski, 1995). Eating disorders are an issue affecting millions of people worldwide, with 3.4% of the population having a diagnosis (Kjelsan, Bjornstrom and Gotestom, 2004). It is likely the incidence rate for eating disorders is higher than this, although many people suffering from them deny the problem and therefore do not seek diagnosis or treatment. Research in this area is particularly important as it appears that more and more people are developing the disorders and concealing them. Once the causes for eating disorders have been fully investigated it may be possible to accurately identify individuals who are predisposed to suffer with their eating behaviour.
