Moving on to the 1930s, we shall now look at the sources discussing the development of what was the most important asset of British air strategy, the fighter. Paraphrasing the Second World War Controller of Aircraft Production in 1931, 'we had too few of the right fighters and too many of the wrong', referring to the dominance of the slow, wooden, biplane in an age where the monoplane fighter ruled. We can trace the development of fighter production by turning to Figure 9 below. The chart details, as accurately as is possible with existing evidence, the aircraft schemes of 1933 and 1937, showing that there was a growing interest in the modern fighter, expressed by an increase in fighter production from 454 in 1933 to 6730 by 1937. However, being limited to the production figures of the aircraft schemes of 1933 and 1937 does not present a fully accurate picture of change and trend in fighter production, as it summarily ignores developments in between the schemes, such as the abortive Air Fighting Strength Scheme of 1936. Ironically, a valid picture of fighter production could be attained simply by understanding the fact that in 1936 the Air Staff attempted to boost fighter production with this failed scheme. It is essential that we use all the available evidence collectively. By following such a maxim, we can check the original source on the production of cars in 1938 (Figure 8), and now place a bias in the research towards fighters. Appendix 4 contains the exact figures of fighter delivery from June 1938 to May 1939. For the purposes of this paper, and in order to maintain simplicity, we will focus on Spitfire deliveries from this source (Figure 10), as they possessed a higher operational value than their Hurricane counterpart.
