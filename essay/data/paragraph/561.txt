In conclusion, stem cells are a unique population of cells that have generated huge potential for use in medicine. Pluripotent stem cells are derived from either the embryo or the adult, and have the ability to differentiate into a wide range of different cell types and to renew themselves indefinitely, properties which could in the future be utilised to treat a range of different medical conditions. The use of ES cells in treating diabetes, for example, raises many ethical and safety issues surrounding the use and generation of embryonic tissues. However, these problems could be avoided by the use of adult stem cells which have recently demonstrated the capability to differentiate into various tissue types previously thought to be impossible. With further investigation these cells may represent a viable and safe alternative to embryo-derived pluripotent stem cells.
