The final chapter will be devoted to a direct critique of Cruickshank's recent article The dissertation will conclude by opposing Cruickshank's claims that there is a logical contradiction at the core of realism because of its insistence on two distinct domains of reality (the intransitive and the transitive) in addition to his insistence that realism should engage in a 'dialogic' immanent critique of ontology. The discussion of Cruickshank's article will draw upon the main arguments presented throughout the dissertation in order to show the validity of the basic realist argument that there are two distinct realms of reality.
