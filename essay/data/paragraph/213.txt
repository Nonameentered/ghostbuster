It is true that Rousseau is most concerned with the organisation of social order based upon the exercise of virtue, rather than on preserving the individual's relative freedom of action. Through this construct, Rousseau categorically denies the individual any sovereignty except for a participatory role in the community. Effectively, the state attains a strongly fortified position in which ' [t]he more the natural strengths are dead and destroyed, the more the acquired ones are great and durable, and the more solid and perfect this institution is'.
