In the first part of the book, an especially colourful language is used to make facts bear the authors' thesis. Throughout, references are made to other sources, providing the nature of a scientific work the reader has no other choice but to trust. Unfortunately, some of these claims are not always justifiable. As an example, when support is sought in the work of Block or Jensen, the book fails to bring forward other credible scientists' interpretations of the proffered data (Keenan 1999). Other sources may, however, present a very different view on the subject matter.
