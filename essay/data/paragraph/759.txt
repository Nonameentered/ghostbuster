The strong monarchy which had taken over in Milan, Venice and Naples was not firmly established in Florence and, therefore, the merchants and bankers could make decisions based on their own judgement. This made Florence 'a city of entrepreneurs and economic independence rather than a prey to the prince's favour' Black believes that this 'contributed to the high profile which Florentines had in European banking circles by 1500' Florence's status as a rich city, therefore, gave its citizens the opportunity to invest in art and to commission work from the best artists. 'The great passion for magnificence which this wealth encouraged explains why so many outstanding works of art appeared in Florence during the fifteenth century.'
