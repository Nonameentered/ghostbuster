The diagram below shows the generalised structure of a protein: It can be seen that the structure of a protein is composed of amino acids which are connected by peptide bonds which form linkage between amino acids. By studying the sequence of amino acids connected by peptide bonds a protein can be divided into three domains called primary, secondary and tertiary structures. When studying the three dimensional structure of a protein the isoelectric point of the amino acids forming the protein is crucial in determining the structure the protein takes. This is because the electric charges that amino acids carry means that adjacent amino acids can form electrostatic attractions which thus form part of the overall structure. An example of this can be seen in the diagram. The diagram shows a portion (defining region) of the β-sheet part of the heamaglobin protein. It is this two dimensional region of amino acids that is the most important in ensuring that the haemoglobin protein adopts the correct three dimensional structure. By looking at the amino acid sequence it can be seen that many of the amino acids are oppositely charged due to the different properties of their 'R' groups. It is this charge that is partly responsible for the formation of the hydrogen bonds between the peptide bonds which form the β-sheet. It is interesting to note that the charge difference between amino acids and therefore the strength of the hydrogen bonds is subtly different depending on the direction of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic sides of the 'R' group. For example the lysine and aspartic acid in region of the β-sheet have charges on their 'R' groups that differ due to differences in the dipole moments of their molecules. This in turn due to differences in the isoelectric point of the two amino acids means that the isoelectric point of haemoglobin can be used to manipulate the three dimensional structure of a protein.
