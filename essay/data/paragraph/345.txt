It is clear that, from January 1939, airframe manufacturers started to exceed their production promises. These promises would have been established with policymakers in the deterrence by parity years. Although not explicit in the chart, we can draw three possible conclusions from this. The surpassing of airframe guarantees can almost incontestably be seen as the final nail in the coffin for the parity strategy, as the government encouraged air manufacturers to move towards a war footing. Not only had hopes of an air convention been lost but also the promises of Munich seemed long forgotten. Britannia's trident was now a bayonet and her shield a gas mask. Less probably, it could reflect that manufacturers had simply become more efficient in their production, no longer cruising at barely economical speed. More sinisterly, the data could suggest production profiteering, as captured in the illustration below (albeit in 1935).
