The approximately hundred-year period over which the intellectual and political activity of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin spread has seen the emergence of an immense social and political experiment of revolution and the move toward a communist state. The concept of democracy has over this time been much debated and scrutinised in order to deprive it of its 'bourgeois' elements. However, in the theories of Marx and Engels, there has been too little space left open for a pluralistic approach to state organisation. Communism, or some pure form of democracy within society's organisation has never been achieved.
