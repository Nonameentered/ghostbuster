The results of this study can have far reaching implications. In professional and organisational roles, group size can matter immensely. Group meetings, conferences and even job changes can be undertaken more effectively if the size of the group influence is taken into account. This can also be useful in a home life setting. If for example, a parent requires their children to clean up, they may find it more effective to gather everyone in the room and have them help as a group, and this is backed up by the results of this study. Therefore, it can help to decide whether individual instruction or parent-led instruction is most necessary if an overall understanding of group sizes is taken into account. Equally, it has implications for more formal education. In educational facilities, classes can contain upwards of twenty five students at a time. Research (Schmitt, Gilovich, Goore and Joseph, 1986) shows that mere presence effects occur not only with physical activities, but also with mental activities, such as a typical school project. The results presented here can be used as a guideline for educational staff and teachers in deciding how many people should be gathered in one group. The results support the presence of mere presence effects, though they do not follow the traditional trend of social facilitation theory. They do however show that the presence of one person more than one's self has more of an effect on individual performance than when more people are present, up to a certain point.
