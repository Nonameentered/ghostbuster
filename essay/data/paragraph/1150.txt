Further support comes from evidence that authoritarianism is more pronounced among people with less education (Chrishe, 1954). The theory supports this as working class parents are more likely than upper class parents to stress obedience to authority as they themselves are more likely to obey to the authority of a boss or a supervisor (Kelly, 1969). And it has been found that authoritarian parents tend to produce dominated children who themselves become authoritarian parents (Adorno et al.).
