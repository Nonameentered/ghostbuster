Behavioural treatments are often used to control aggression as well and fortunately can often produce a hugely beneficial result. Stott (1970) used reward appetitive desensitisation in the treatment of a seven year old aggressive son. He gave the boy rewards for not responding physically to events that had traditionally caused aggression and upon which the boy had no control such as weather and temperature change, (Grivas, 2002). In numerous research studies, the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) shows improved quality of life and better academic achievement through increased attention and achievement of tasks. Many students with ADHD have found relief in the classroom by using behaviour modification with a comprehensive reward system, including points, tokens and praise. This is a very good example of the advantages of using a purely behavioural approach to a psychological disorder, however there are still many people argue against it - many refer to its child-like approach where the therapist essentially 'bribes' the patient to behave and won't listen in future if rewards are not given.
