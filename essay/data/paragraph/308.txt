In 1975 Roy Bhaskar published Bhaskar has described his approach in RTS as "an immanent critique of empiricism" (Bhaskar, 1989 [1979]; 169). By this he meant that he was focussing on the, "theoretical, explanatorily significant or 'fundamentally' experimental aspects of science" as these were perceived to be the strengths of the empirical approach (and this is what is entailed in an immanent critique, criticising another philosophy or perspective based on its own standpoints). Therefore, Bhaskar developed a philosophy of science which attempted to argue against the assertion that all knowledge is derived from sense data, by developing a scientific approach that would reconceptualise the nature of causality, the role of experimental activity, and ultimately the constituent features of reality.
