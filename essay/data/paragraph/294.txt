Through sporting practices black men have attempted to counteract the social invisibility imposed on them by an institutionally racist society, yet it is their acceptance of the ideals that compose hegemonic masculinity which ultimately ensures they do not affect the social order. Due to their exclusion from the educational and occupational institutions that confer social esteem on the individuals who have access to them, many black men channel their creative energies into constructing "unique, expressive and conspicuous styles of speech, demeanour and walk etc" (a phenomenon that Majors calls the 'cool pose') which offsets the invisibility they suffer due to their exclusion from the aforementioned institutions (Majors in Messner and Sabo, 1990; 111). Consequently, many black men pursue sporting careers because they can express themselves through the "virtuosity of a performance" and this offers the most realistic route to achieving the goals of hegemonic masculinity (such as being the breadwinner, having strength and dominating women) (110). Therefore, the response of black males through their concentration on sport represents an However, in spite of their adaptation, their actions invariably do not allow them to transcend their Through accepting the ideals of hegemonic masculinity black men pursue sporting careers in a context that is constructed by the racist wider society. In focusing predominantly on sport, black men accept the educational under-representation that is fostered by educational institutions; this is to their detriment as educational attainment is the principle route through which the ideals of hegemonic masculinity are realised and social power is attained (111). Even when black men do manage to become professional athletes, they are still confronted by institutionalised racism as there are remarkably few black managers or coaches in any sport, and the majority of sporting organisations are controlled by white males (113). Therefore, the participation of black males in sporting practices can be conceptualised as a response to the racism of the wider society, yet this response merely serves to reproduce the hegemonic masculine ideal of the marginalisation of black men, as it is predicated upon their acceptance of ideals that inevitably subordinate them. Although black athletes fulfil one element of the hegemonic masculinity (physical prowess), they are prevented from fulfilling other aspects (such as becoming professionals); this notion of contradiction is fundamental to the way hegemonic masculinity operates, and the role of sport in this process shall now be developed.
