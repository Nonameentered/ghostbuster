Some historians have also suggest that the increasing desire amongst the laity for a personal and direct relationship with God, and the subsequent failure of the Church to cater to this aspect led many into the realm of mysticism. Though some have argued that mysticism could be regarded as a form of subversion, it is perhaps more appropriate to think of it as a supplementary to, rather than as a substitute for the institution of the Church. Mysticism of both the fourteenth and sixteenth century coexisted with the Church and may be seen as testament to the religiosity of the Age.
