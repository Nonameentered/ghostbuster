The New World was also an important asset in terms of population; migration relieved the pressure of demographic growth, and colonisation allowed the exploitation of indigenous people and imported African slaves in order to provide cheap labour. This was particularly useful for the extraction of one of America's most useful resources to the west: coal. Kenneth Pomeranz, in particular, stresses the importance of coal to Europe, as the transition from a timber to coal fuelled society 'relaxed the land constraint in a more fundamental way than any other innovation before turn-of-the-century chemicals and electricity' Although Pomeranz disputes that divergence occurred before 1800, Europe definitely exploited American resources from the moment of discovery. East Asia had coalmines but they were not as accessible as those in the New World; China's best coal deposits were in Shaanxi, 700 miles from the country's main area of production the Yangzi Delta. Parthasarathi concludes that 'the massive use of coal certainly made possible an energy economy that far surpassed one based on timber and made possible huge iron output, the steam engine and eventually railways' The Americas gave the West nutrients, fuel and territory that it could exploit and command, altogether creating the potential for an energised society capable of increased economic production and therefore greater prosperity. Whilst Pomeranz's conclusion stressing the cruciality of coal and colonies is both overzealous and too late in history to explain economic divergence by 1800, the New World provides a good example of how Western attitude to trade and exploitation helped them to progress ahead of the East.
