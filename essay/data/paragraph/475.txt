In conclusion I would recommend acquiring the Peugeot. This will give us a competitive start to compete with the rest of the firms in the industry. This is based on the fact that the barrier of entry into the market is too huge for a new startup. As the market is already saturated with more than 500 automobile companies, consumers tend to look for established brands to base their purchases on.
