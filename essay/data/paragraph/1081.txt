The failure of the Clergy to live up to lay expectations of moral superiority (derived from being the agent through whom man communicated with God) and to fulfill the functions they were ordained for opened up the Church to criticisms, from without and within. 'On the eve of the Reformation, laity protested against pervasive clerical fiscalism, absenteeism, mal-administration, and concubinage..." and were joined in their castigations, by some members of the Clergy, and more notably, the humanists. John Colet, the humanist dean of St Paul's even went as far as to blame "all the ills of the Church on the secular lifestyles and 'covetousness' of the Clergy" and urged "reformation of the Church's estate" According to Duggan, even "Catholic and Protestant historians alike largely concur on the (sexual) 'immorality' of many Clergy on the eve of the Reformation." However, a reconsideration of the reaction to the abuses of the Clergy is necessary. Despite the widespread practice of concubinage, the population of Europe was not overly concerned unless this moral failing on the part of the Clergy impinged on their primary role of administering the sacraments. As Duggan articulates succinctly: "whether the clergy were 'immoral' or not, the more germane question is whether they ministered adequately to the needs of their flock."
