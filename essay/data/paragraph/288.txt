The development of sporting practices in the 19 It has been argued that modern sport shares the characteristics of modern society; in Weberian terms, sport is bureaucratised, secular, structured by rules and regulations, and can therefore be described as Alternatively, the opposite has been argued. Although sport appears rationalised, it is essentially the institutionalisation of play, and is consequently irrational and purposeless, which means it has developed as an alternative to the forces of modernity (even if the institutional form that it takes is modern). Guttman has described sport as having its "roots in the dark soil of our instinctive lives" but that the form it takes is "dictated by modern society" (Guttman, cited in Crossett in Messner and Sabo, 1990; 47). Throughout these descriptions a connection between masculinity and the development of institutionalised sport has been ignored. The justification for the exclusion of issues of masculine ideals is derived from the belief that the 19 However, this perspective cannot explain how international competitions expanded upon Similarly, the perspective that sport is essentially irrational cannot explain how it has developed into a major social institution in an era that has witnessed increasing rationality (47). Therefore, although the Weberian and Marxists characterisations of sporting institutions aren't altogether inaccurate they need to be expanded to accommodate the influence of a gender ideology (of which 'manliness' formed a crucial part) upon the development of institutions in modern society (47). Todd Crossett endeavoured to show how the English public schools were a pivotal institution in disseminating the gender ideology, and his evidence for this shall now be discussed.
