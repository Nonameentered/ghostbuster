In order for infection by Legionella to take place, the bacterium must first be present in an aerosol, enabling entry into the lung. To enter the alveolar epithelial cells, specific glycolipids that form part of the outer cell membrane need to be recognised, allowing the passage of the Legionella. This glycolipid is called l-rhamnose and is cleaved off the In addition, to release the In addition to these receptor mediated processes, specific secretion systems are also present which aid attachment and entry into the host cell. Such secretion systems include the common type two secretion systems however my research is particularly interested in the dot/icm (derepressed outer membrane and retained inner membrane complex) type IV secretion system, as shown in figure 1 below:  Once attached to the initial glycolipids, These proteins known as effectors are then transported by the The purpose of such effectors is therefore to alter the characteristics of the phagosome such that it cannot complete maturation and hence becomes an ideal niche for the growth of Through the use of electron microscopy, Such evidence suggests that once the Bhardwaj et al (17, reviewed in 1) identified the role of the effector within the host environment. Supplementation of the culture medium with certain amino acids (asparagine, glutamine and histidine) in which viral replication is usually blocked, promoted the replication of  The next stage of the microbial lifecycle is the process of entry into the macrophage and the destruction of the phagosome. Studies have shown that the presence of
