The two parts of mortality; starvation and disease were both influences on the early modern population, not least because their presence pre-empted any potential rise in fertility through restricting marriage partners, increasing migration and affecting prices and wages. The influence of factors other than fertility can be seen in the rise of the population despite a fall in real wages; I am afraid that I remain unconvinced by the long lag theory and thus this slowness of response between the two seems to imply that mortality had more influence than Wrigley and Schofield suggested. John Hatcher points out that the volatility of both fertility and mortality during this time is suggestive not of Wrigley and Schofield's model where '...there were very few departures from the tend line', but of a model where many influences were working to shape the population. Hatcher also notes that assumptions made by Wrigley and Schofield to fill in gaps left by poor evidence and their small sample had led to the effects of mortality being underestimated. 'A far more severe impact is revealed by the registers not included in the study and also by the abundance of wills probated in a wide range of ecclesiastical jurisdictions." Additionally, Wrigley and Schofield's determination to prove the dominance of fertility can be seen in their relegation of mortality to a mere 'condition' of population change whereas fertility is considered a 'cause'; mortality is presented as something which affects fertility rather than as an influence on population in its own right. As Hatcher points out 'in any analysis of causality the designation of some factors as 'conditions' or 'circumstances' and others as 'causes' is liable to exert a powerful influence over the outcome." What Hatcher calls 'a tangle of contradictions and reservations' in fact 'lie behind the series of confident judgements...made.'
