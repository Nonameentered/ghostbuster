However, it is not sufficient to explicate the realist ontology for social reality and declare it to be appropriate without substantiation. In TMGA Margaret Archer also undertakes an immanent critique in the same manner as Bhaskar did in RST; she critiques individualism and collectivism as she argues they were both deficient because of their adherence to empiricism, whilst structuration theory is criticised for sinking structure and agency together, instead of acknowledging their separability, which is the precondition for "explaining why things are so and not otherwise" in society (Archer, 1995; 64). Archer's critique is immanent as she shows exactly how both individualism and collectivism failed to respond to the mutually regulative function of "the tri-partite link between ontology, methodology, and practical social theorising" (Archer, 1995; 3).
