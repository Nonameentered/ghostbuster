The influence of the media on the cognitions and behaviour of the child has become a much debated topic over recent years. This can be attributed to a number of reasons. In recent times, media technologies have advanced significantly, making television and films more accessible to children. This has given rise to fears that the child is spending too much time with these media and not enough with real-life friends, relationships or experiences (McQuail, 2000). It is thought that this trend leads to a false perception of reality, from which children can indiscriminately learn and imitate (Huesman, Moise-Titus, Podolski and Aron, 2003). Thorndike (1911) formulated the law of exercise and effects, which claims that behaviours repeated more often are learned and become strong, through the associated exercise, thus leaving the child more susceptible to imitate aggression seen on television (Hamilton, 1998). It is also suggested that children view television passively, and to a certain extent absorb its contents, rather than viewing it critically (Lang, 2000; Jenkins, 1999). Bandura's (1973) social learning theory implies that children model themselves on what they observe: aggression is seen as a viable means of self expression, leading to conspicuous antisocial behaviour (Bushman, 1995).
