Renaissance philosophers such as Alberti, Ficino and Pico della Mirandola often looked back to classical antiquity for their beliefs and doctrines. Florence, with its long classical tradition, was the ideal place for them to work. Alberti worked on both scientific and aesthetic theory. He promoted the idea of visual perspective as well as outlining a theory of beauty based on mathematics. Ficino revived Platonism and turned it into an important force in the intellectual life of Renaissance Florence which was influential in how the Renaissance was shaped. Pico della Mirandola blended Christianity with Platonic and Aristotelian philosophies to create a philosophical system which was an important influence on the Renaissance.
