The term "endosymbiotic theory" was first coined by Lynn Margulis in 1967, when she proposed that both mitochondria and chloroplast in eukaryotic cells are descendants of aerobic bacteria which were endocytosed by anaerobic eukaryotes and were later on incorporated into the cell The essential points of her hypothesis are that free-living bacteria were engulfed by the primordial anaerobic eukaryotic cell, to form a mutually beneficial relationship, which led to the development of organelles, having their own nuclear DNAs and the ability to replicate independently of the eukaryote cell They may also have provided benefits to the host cell, such as ATP production via aerobic respiration and the production of oxygen, which is investigated further in the next section.
