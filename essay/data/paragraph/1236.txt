Another approach to explaining these age-related cognitive deficits is the reduced- inhibition hypothesis (Hasher & Zacks, 1988). This hypothetical proposes that age differences are due to a decrement in the ability to control cognitive processes in the face of distractions. Hence, as inhibition plays a key role in visual search tasks, this hypothesis was tested through explorations of selective attention. Research into inhibition has predominantly focused on using the famous Stroop Test (Straoop, 1935).
