The birth of Humanism in Germany was much different than in Italy; firstly, its meaning and sign were geared more towards a technical application of classical linguistic versions than using classical Greek and Latin to create a new form of literary writing, mainly used by theologians and philosophers. Furthermore, the spiritual reform that gradually ensued in German territory came to acts as underlay for the later reform, and as Luther was to write that 'so-called 'theology' of Christ and of the gospel had been completely forgotten', the solution could only come thought the study of the scriptures. This was to be an endeavour requiring the close study of the Greek sources by trained philologists. Consequently, by the end of the fifteenth century the intellectual life of parts of Germany had become quite cosmopolitan, with the new movement of humanism spreading from Prague, over Vienna, to Basel. From the Universities of Prague and Vienna had come for example Zwingli, the Swiss reformer, while William Reuchlin from Pforzheim was becoming famous with his Greek-oriented studies and transformation of Hebraic studies. Moreover, by the mid fifteenth century, Germany had become capable of producing fine output of Latin composition, often adhering higher standards of learning than much of European provinces. Thus we find Johannes Reuchlin in the forties teaching, besides German and Latin, Greek, Hebrew and some Aramaic in 'picturesque Heidelberg'.
