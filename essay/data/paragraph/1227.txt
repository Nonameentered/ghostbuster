To conclude, it is apparent that wrongful convictions, such as the Kelly Michaels, Larry Mayes and Bernard Webster cases, highlight the need for the police and legal system to be aware of aspects of psychology in order for witness confidence to be adequately handled. Research has found children to be generally highly suggestible to family and authority figures, especially when repeated questions and erroneous suggestions are implemented. This suggestibility can also affect adult memories, as illustrated in the case of Larry Mayes, where his conviction was solely based on the identification made under hypnosis. The effect of suggestion appears to be fairly enhanced when made by an authoritative interviewer; and so it is important to minimise the influence of authority during forensic interviews, to minimise suggestions being accepted as truth. Furthermore, there are still many issues to be addressed with regards to line-up procedures, and so these should be constantly monitored to ensure their fairness and effectiveness in garnering accurate information.
