Technology is a representative case of how the potential for development in East Asia was not wholly fulfilled, whereas Europe learned from Asian inventions and progressed ahead of them. The East experienced many technological developments, such as the aforementioned irrigation system, prior to Europe and by the early modern period they possessed a level of superiority. For instance, China explored rudimentary time measurement with water clocks during the Song period (960-1279). Also, agriculture was advanced not only through hydraulic engineering such as ditches and dykes, but through the development of an iron plough during the sixth century, which could adjust the depth of the furrow. Asia, in fact, was responsible for some of the most fundamental inventions in early history: the compass (960 AD), gunpowder (tenth century), paper (100 AD) and printing. As Joel Mokyr notes 'by the end of the middle ages, it appears that China was about ready to undergo a process eerily similar to the great British Industrial Revolution' However, this prophetic stage of development was not fulfilled in the manner that European technological development succeeded.
