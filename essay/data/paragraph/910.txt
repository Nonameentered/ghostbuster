One of the most comprehensive works on memes is Blackmore's (1999) The Meme Machine, which uses memes to elaborate an ambitious theory designed to account for numerous aspects of human evolution and psychology (Jahoda, 2002). Blackmore claims that imitation, as the primary mechanism by which memes replicate themselves, can be taken as the basis of a major theory of the evolution of the human mind and even of what it means to be a conscious self. Imitation is posited as the key to what set our ancestors apart from all other animals. The theory starts with one simple mechanism - the competition between memes to get into human brains and be passed on again - and from this it gives rise to explanation for such diverse phenomena as the evolution of the enormous human brain, the origins of language, human altruism, sex, religion, and even the evolution of the internet (Blackmore, 1999).
