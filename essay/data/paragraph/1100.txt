This link between women, artifice, enticement and luxury might account in part for the 'Female Luxury', which Sombart, at the turn of the twentieth century harps on. Sombart attributed an important role to women of leisure in the development of luxury, and commented: "luxury was fostered by illustrious mistresses and promoted for their sake" In his central theory, which states that: "all personal luxury springs from purely sensuous pleasure" The notion of women as 'objects' or adjuncts is also suggested in Veblen's illustration of the corset. While it "lowers the subjects' vitality, rendering her permanently unfit for work...the loss suffered on that score is offset by the gain in reputability which comes of her visibly increased expensiveness and infirmity." Though these women may gain some 'reputability' for being women of leisure, it is apparent that the men on whom these women are dependent reap the bulk of this 'reputability'. Hence, while women seem to consume more than men, it is the case because women have a duty, as adjuncts, not only to consume on behalf of the household, but also to display 'conspicuous consumption' in a way that would serve to elevate the status of their husbands/master.
