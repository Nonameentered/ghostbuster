Avoidance learning is instrumental learning in which the response averts an aversive stimulus before it occurs. It is a type of therapy that that combines classical conditioning and operant conditioning. Classical conditioning predicts the aversive event that will follow a certain behavior and operant conditioning "teaches" through negative reinforcement, how to prevent the event from occurring. (Skinner, B, F., 1974) This method teaches patients how to avoid situation which they fear and feel anxious about. However, this is merely avoiding the situation and not addressing the real issue behind the fear and feel anxious about. Conversely, this method only works on selective disorders. For example it does not work on sociopaths as they have chronic under-arousal.
