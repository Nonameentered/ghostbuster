The position women were to occupy in society was set out to the population through a number of mediums. Scriptural references in homilies and religious services put emphasis upon '...the procreation and religious education of children, the regulation of sexual activity, and mutual comfort and support.' A distinction was made between suitable female and male duties; 'The husband was held to be the superior partner, the wife the subordinate and inferior...her foremost duty was obedience." In the advice guides published, women were seen to be 'material and passive...weak in body...and unfitted for work or public life.' As such they were expected to remain in the private sphere, '...unquestioningly obedient to her husband, accepting husbandly reproofs meekly...bearing her husbands faults...accommodating his various moods and on any breach being the first to seek reconciliation." Satires and other anti-female publications played upon the popular images of women as sexually insatiable, nagging scolds, as well as playing upon the images of marriage as an end to freedom and fun, and a life of supporting a wife who would stop at nothing to get her own way. Finally, the expected social position of women was expressed by the authorities through the law; 'nowhere did the wife appear more completely subordinate to her husband than in the common law'. However, in the eyes of the law, a woman Widows enjoyed a certain amount of freedom, however along with spinsters were so marginalised socially, for being 'master-less', and economically, with only a few poorly paid trades to work in, that they had very hard lives. Susan Amussen argues that this contradiction is one of the main reasons why the wish for '...clear subordination of wives to husbands...was never fully realised.'
