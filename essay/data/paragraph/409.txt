The Endosymbiotic Theory states that eukaryotic organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, evolved from prokaryotic cells that were engulfed by larger eukaryotic cells. According to Lynn Margulis, the main proponent of the theory, the organelles were originally free-living prokaryotes that lived in a mutually beneficial relationship with the host cell. The theory, first proposed in 1967, suggests that the engulfed bacteria gave the host cell a form of aerobic respiration for the generation of energy, creating the mitochondria, and allowed them to practice photosynthesis, thus creating chloroplasts. The idea was initially controversial and was met with a great deal of skepticism from the scientific community. However, with the advent of new technologies, such as electron microscopy and molecular techniques such as molecular phylogeny, more and more evidence has been found to support the endosymbiotic theory.
