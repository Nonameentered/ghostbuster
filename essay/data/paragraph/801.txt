There are many factors which may trigger an eating disorder. Lieberman, Gauvin, Bukowski and White (2001) found significant causes to be peer pressure to be thin, social reinforcement and body related teasing. They present the argument that as peer relations are very important in adolescence, if the social group values the thin body ideal highly then individuals aspire to achieve this, even through deviant eating patterns. In addition to this Blowers, Loxton, Grady-Flesser and Dawe (2003) found that the media plays an important role in the internalisation of the thin body ideal and increasing body dissatisfaction, and therefore, contributing to the development of eating disorders. These can be considered social influences over eating behaviour and are directly linked to how the individual perceives themselves in relation to others. This appears to be a highly influential factor for eating pathology because if a person's evaluation of their body does not meet the real or imagined body ideal set by peers, or by the media, then deviant eating behaviour seems to be the coping technique adopted to achieve what is believed to be desirable (Gordon, 1990).
