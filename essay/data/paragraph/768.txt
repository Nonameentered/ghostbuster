Marsilio Ficino, leader of the Platonic Academy of Florence, was responsible for translating the works of Plato which were written in Greek. He also wrote his own philosophical works such as James Hankins has commented on the 'leading role played by Marsilio Ficino and Neoplatonic Philosophy on the cultural life of the High Renaissance' The Platonic Academy of Florence was Ficino's primary vehicle for the spread of his ideas. There has been some debate over the significance of the Academy. Gustavo Uzielli, a Toscanelli scholar, has even suggested that the Academy was nothing but a fable Arnaldo della Torre, on the other hand, wrote The authenticity of Ficino's letters, which Uzielli had suggested to be forgeries, was defended. Della Torre describes how the Academy was founded by Cosimo de'Medici in 1462 and how Ficino was appointed the head. According to Della Torra, the Academy held regular activities such as lectures, disputations and banquets. The Academy was made up of the Medici patrons as well as around one hundred prominent statesmen, poets, orators, doctors, lawyers and ecclesiastics of the later fifteenth century James Hankins, however, suggests tah 'Ficino did have an academy of a sort, but if so, it was a thing quite different, and much less important, than has generally been thought'
