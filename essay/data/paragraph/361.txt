The 1950s represented a unique decade in the post war world, a decade which saw the birth of a range of film genres hitherto unseen. The development of the bomb and the nuclear arms race saw the emergence of 'Bomb Cinema', which flourished in the shadow of the Cold War. Atomic anxieties were not confined to espionage dramas or missile crisis films but featured in Science Fiction genres ranging from creature features to alien invasion thrillers and Nuclear Romances.  I argue that Bomb Cinema during this period seriously subverted the official Cold War propaganda line by presenting differing visions of the atomic age. Working under the constant eye of the HUAC, the distinctively science fiction wing of bomb cinema used covert images to depict anxieties that accompanied life with the bomb. Recent findings also support Kubrick's observation on the instability of the arms race. We now know that military had developed the 'Single Integrated Operation Plan', which worked on the assumption that America would be willing to be the first to use nuclear weapons.
