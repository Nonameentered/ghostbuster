E. coli cells at the mid-exponential phase (OD486 of 0.400-0.600) were mixed in equal numbers at a 1:1 ratio. As soon as the cultures were mixed, 0.1ml samples were drawn. Samples 1-8 were placed on selective media with the components and concentrations as indicated in the material and methods section as well as 0.05% Nalidixic acid. Samples 9x and 9y were used as a negative control and placed on LB agar. Samples were incubated for 24 hours and growth assessed. Following this, 0.1ml of sample was also taken and placed onto the same plates again at 15mins, 30mins, 60mins and 120 minutes. Plate 1 and 7 also had their areas divided in 2 so that 0.11ml of the mixed population was spread over the plate and 0.04ml placed in the area corresponding to the recipient strain to observe for growth of this strain by itself. This was repeated similarly with the other sample plates.  The results of the experiment showed that the bacteria on certain plates started to show growth at certain time intervals whilst those on other plates showed growth at later intervals.
