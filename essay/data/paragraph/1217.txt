The investigators of this case were actually told to engage in lengthy, repeated and direct questioning as this would be required for children to disclose the truth, as they have a tendency to initially deny any abuse. However, it has been recently argued that the strongest studies, in terms or methodology, indicate that if directly asked, children do not deny sexual abuse (Bruck & Ceci, 2004). Therefore, it appears that the combination of repeated questioning and being repeatedly told of their teacher's actions, led to increased familiarity, which in turn, due to inadequate source monitoring, resulted in the false reports. This coupled with the numerous other erroneous police procedures, highlights the need for the police to be made aware of certain aspects of child development and ways in which to elicit more accurate testimonies. This is especially required as younger children are only more susceptible to suggestion when there is a biased interviewer, otherwise they remember just as accurately as older children (Ceci, Ross & Toglia, 1987, as cited in Toglia, Ross, & Ceci, 1992).
