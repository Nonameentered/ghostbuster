The PRA technique encompasses almost every possible method for determining the best course of action for any given development scheme. It also demands that trends should be checked and checked again. It attempts to give some power to the local people in the decision making process in the hope that this will encourage a more enthusiastic, thoughtful and effective participation from them. These strengths give it the potential to be a very powerful tool. However, given the complexity and range of its constituents and the importance of their correct application it is also very difficult to use. Nor is the technique immune to the effects of the attitudes of those who use it. The opposite is more realistic; a PRA is a volatile procedure highly sensitive to style of its facilitator.
