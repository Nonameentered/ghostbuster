During the transferring of samples across the wells, the pipettes used might not be very accurate, resulting in incorrect dilutions. For proper agglutination to occur the RBCs must be thoroughly mixed with the virus suspension in the wells and failure to do so will not result in haemagglutination. Furthermore, the viruses needed a rather significant amount of time to attach to the surface of the RBCs. If the RBCs were not given enough time to settle down to the bottom of the well or if the RBCs were lysed a cloudy pink suspension might be obtained instead. It was rather difficult to determine the end point as it was subject to personal options and thus the dilution factor of the end point would be different. As the wells were left for different amount of time, a comparative test among them would not be very accurate.
