In 1984, after six-months of psychotherapy, the victim was hypnotited and asked to identify the man she could recall as harassing her before the rape. In the hypnotic state, she recalled the person as a man she had seen driving a van around town and mentioned he was one of the perpetrators. The police gave her a photo of Larry Mayes, which the victim rapidly identified. This was despite her having previously stated that one of the men was tall, and Mayes being six inches shorter than her original description. The victim pleaded guilty to the charge of obtaining a false identification due to her inability to decide if the identification was produced in a hypnotic or non-hypnotic state.
