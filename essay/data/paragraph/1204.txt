The world of an AD patient is arguably far more unstable than that of a normal elderly person, this instability is partly due to the changes in attention. These deficits can range from distractibility to an inability to maintain attention. Perry and Hodges (1999) estimate that up to two-thirds of patients with Alzheimer's show evidence of an attentional deficit, hence it is likely to be linked to AD. Cano and Heaton (1993, as cited in Maciejewski, 2001) considered attentional deficits to be very important in the early detection of AD as it has been found that in comparison to other dementias, AD patients showed a far greater impairment on attentional tasks.
