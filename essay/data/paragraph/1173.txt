If the control of body weight were exclusively attributable to biological processes then we would naturally eat a completely balanced diet and have no real preferences for foods. It appears that the hypothalamus is important in the regulation of body weight. However, it is not only associated with lower level processes in the body, it also incorporates higher-level processes such as possible cognitive influences from higher brain areas, suggesting that there may be non-homeostatic influences over eating control. There is considerable evidence that a person does not purely feel hungry as a result of the body's homeostatic function. External factors such as learned behaviour can be extremely powerful over seemingly biological drives.
