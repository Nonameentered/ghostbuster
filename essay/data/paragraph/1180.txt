Exercise is believed to help increase metabolic rate. Melby, Scholl, Edwards & Bullough (1993) found post exercise metabolic rate (PEMR) to be higher than RMR following ninety minutes of strenuous resistive exercise, and remained higher than the RMR until the following morning, fifteen hours after exercising. This shows that strenuous resistive exercise can raise PEMR for a relatively long period of time. So the ideal time to eat is after exercise, when the metabolic rate is highest, resulting in a faster breakdown of food, with the maximum possible calorie expenditure. Thus by choosing an appropriate time to eat and by exercising, a person can increase their metabolic rate. A person can also control what they eat; it has been found that eating fat is linked to weight gain, whereas choosing carbohydrates and proteins not only satisfies appetite better, but also increases the metabolism (Lean, 2003). Fluids as well as food can increase metabolic rate; drinking 500ml of water can increase metabolic rate by 30% (Boschmann, Steiniger, Hille, Tank, Adams, Sharma, Klaus, Luft & Jordan, 2003). So although metabolic rate is a biological mechanism, which is genetically determined, the person can wilfully influence it, by altering their lifestyle and enable weight loss to take place.
