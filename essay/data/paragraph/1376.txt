To join the wires together, several methods are available. These include crimp and wire wrap, as well as fusion joining. Crimp joints consume a lot of wires and power and are difficult to maintain. You also need specialist tools to make connections in this way, which are costly and could be time-consuming. As a result these methods should be avoided. Wire wraps also consume many wires but are better for the environment and less bulky. They are also very difficult to make, and to make a good connection you need to make sure each wrap is tight. For these reasons, we should move away from wire wraps.
