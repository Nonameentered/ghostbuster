The economic structure of Florence helped to promote the development of its art and culture. Its wealthy citizens had many opportunities to invest in art and the city had a higher demand for it. Artist's wages were higher in Florence than in most places and for this reason artists from elsewhere often moved to the city. There was also a great wealth of patronage in Florence, Barbero states that the 'achievements of the arts in Florence during the fifteenth century have no equal elsewhere in Italy' Florence had a great number of patrons, from the richest to the humblest citizens, and from the papacy to foreign princes. Barbero has noted, however, that some of these funds 'were destined to be used on works of art and literature, including those of a self-commemorative type' Barbero's claim is reflected in the fact that several artists, such as Michelozzo and Donatello, were employed by the government for some time, rather than by individual patrons.
