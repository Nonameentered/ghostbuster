As well as being the centre of economic life, London was also the centre of political action. This centralisation was a major pull factor for migration to the city. 'Generations of historians have connected the rise of the modern capital with its political role' The number of Peers increased from around 30 in the 1560s to 90 in the 1630s. They would bring with them their family and servants which added to the growing population. The Royal household grew under the Reign of Charles I. While under Elizabeth there were around 1,000 in Court, this increased to around 2,600 under Charles I. The Court used to move around the realm in the High Middle Ages, but from the reign of Edward IV it remained in or around London. This 'attracted to the city the custom and residence of county landowners' The number of resident gentlemen in London increased and the number of MP's rose from 300 in the early sixteenth century to 500 during the mid-seventeenth. The Court also provided patronage for musicians and artists which drew them into the city.
