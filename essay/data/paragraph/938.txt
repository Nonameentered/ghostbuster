Figure 2 depicts the negative correlation between AUDIT score and seeking social support score. Again, there is a considerable amount of scatter on the graph and it is arguably harder to detect the presence of a significant negative relationship between the two variables from the graph alone. This may be due to the fact that the maximum score on this sub-scale is only 15, resulting in less possible variation between participants in terms of their score and thus less potential for such a strong negative correlation to emerge. Whilst still significant therefore, this correlation does not appear to be as strong as that between AUDIT and distancing score, a fact which is confirmed by their respective co-efficient values.
