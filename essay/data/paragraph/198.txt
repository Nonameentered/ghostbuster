In both the early drafts of the Manifesto and even, Marx eventually began to forgo his more abstract ideological definition and investigated the practical aspects of a revolution. 'Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution' he wrote in the Manifesto. His position on revolution was one of direct action; 'The emancipation of the working class must be conquered by the working classes themselves. They then merge with the revolutionary proletariat of all other countries in the common struggle for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie'. The role of the government had to be one of bureaucratic management; not, as previously envisioned, one of paternal bureaucracy-style reform.
