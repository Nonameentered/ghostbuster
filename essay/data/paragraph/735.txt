One of the greatest areas where attitude constricted eastern development was trade. Interest in long-distance trade had prevailed during the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, but this was not a lasting feature of Asian history- after 1431-33 there were no more economic or diplomatic voyages made by China during the early modern period. The East's loss of interest in the West was the opposite of European attitude; in 1498 Vasco de Gama discovered a sea trade route between Portugal and India, the first Portuguese ships reached China by 1514, and the Spanish had occupied the Philippines by 1565. Whilst the East had retreated, the West had attempted to encroach upon their land and exploit newfound areas for luxury goods.
