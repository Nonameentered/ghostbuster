In sports racing, endurance racing engine usually has higher displacements between (3000-7000cc). Endurance vehicles consists of higher displacement 4-stroke engines equipped with corresponding transmission systems. The engines had to be lightweight and more durable since endurance vehicles need to operate up to 6, 12 or 24 hours on a runway.  In motorbike racing, the racing engine should have high power output, light weight and also lower fuel consumption so that a greater torque could be obtained in the engine. The commonly used number of cylinders was either two or four complemented with a suitable transmission system. Although V-configuration engines generated greater performance, fairing was normally used for weight reduction so that the centre of mass was not significantly increased. In addition, the V-configuration should be abandoned since they were prone to produce greater vibrations .
