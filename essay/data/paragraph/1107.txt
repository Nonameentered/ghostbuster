The obvious place to begin would be to examine the impact of 'charismatic rule' on its recipients, the German people. It is clear that Hitler's hold over the German mind was established mainly due to 'the promised recovery from national humiliation', and also, make no mistake, by the scarcity of opposition. As E.J.D.mirsheim remarks: ' Charisma can only appear when the general expectation of it is aroused in advance.' To all appearances, a classic case of the 'great man' gaining influence rapidly by taking advantage of favourable conditions, for 'great nations never pass at once from servitude to freedom.'. An opinion poll conducted in April 1936 revealed that 'about three-quarters of German citizens thought Hitler had done some good, and half of that number thought he had done a great deal of it.' This high level of adulation suggests that the German people were greatly satisfied with Hitler's rule, and this in turn boosted the image of the Nazi Party as the responsible government of Germany-a factor that was crucial to keep the people behind the Party and not to be disillusioned with it. It is evident that the identification of the people with the Fuhrer was such as to require no enforcer of loyalty, as stated by A.J.P.Taylor ' Hitler was not a dictator; he had no need to be. He was a prophet to whom the German nation had voluntarily submitted.' This evidently strengthens the standing of the Party as a dictatorship, but would this admiration persist, come what may?
