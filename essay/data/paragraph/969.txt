A torque cell contained a mechanical element- the circular shaft, and a sensor- strain gauges. Firstly the type of strain gauges was chosen. In fact there were two types of gauges, metal or semiconductor. The metal gauges were in the form of a flat coil of wire or etched metal foil and the semiconductor gauges were a strip of semiconductor material in-between two connection leads. The element was wafer-like and had an insulating backing material so that it could be stuck like a postage stamp onto surfaces, using a suitable adhesive. Strain gauges worked on the principal that:
