The most influential agents in fuelling the Victorian consumerist craze and driving the force of change can easily be said to have been the department stores of the nineteenth century. These general stores were the places 'where ordinariness and cheapness made commodities alluring to virtually everyone' while making 'the material objects of the new consumer society objects of desire' (Loeb 1994:3). These department stores, as Holcombe (2000:4) has it, not only had economic importance as the basis of a retail system, but also were part of the 'visual and psychological environment of the city' due to their impressive architectural constructions. Among the most famous and successful stores were Harrods, Bleriot and Gamages in London, W. & G. Foyle McAllister Bros. in Belfast, and the Army and Navy Stores. Most predominant in their spectacular rise over the second half of the century was however Whiteley's, a private department store which, when opened in Westbourne Grove, London in 1863, soon earned its fame for being 'the universal provider' (Rappaport 1996:61). Its customer base, as with many stores, included people of all classes due to its comparatively affordable prices, although the greatest portion was found to be made up of the middle class (Rappaport 1996). But besides providing an almost inexhaustible variety of goods on sale, the department store also became the stage for 'conspicuous consumption': Besides orders, items were displayed with detailed aspects to draw in potential customers. Especially the central feature, the tearoom, was a source of shame for some (Finn 1998).
