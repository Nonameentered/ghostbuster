The vast amount of research into the cognitive abilities of children discussing scientific concepts is certainly provocative, and verifies the argument that it is more effective and efficient to teach scientific concepts in a subject-specific format. The research of Massey and Gelman (1988) and Rosengren et al (1991) gives invaluable insight into the cognitions underlying the differences in attributes between the living and material worlds, and indicate that this concept is best conveyed to the child at the age of five, when they have developed the faculties to understand the concept. The experiments of Hood (1995) and Krist et al (1993) reveal that concepts such as basic understanding of the laws of gravity can be grasped from the age of four-and-a-half. Strevens (2000) and Inagaki and Suiyama (1988) imply the need to teach children basic principles about science when their age is just reaching the peak of the relevant developmental stage.
