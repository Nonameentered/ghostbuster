The hypothesis the jurors compose stories to account for and interpret evidence appears to be a likely resource jurors use for interpreting evidence. Problems arise however in that the evidence used to support the notion that jurors reach verdicts in this way is not always reflective of how real trials work, so inferences made can not be generalised. Problems also arise as to whether the story model is causal. Pennington and Hastie (1992) propose that the story the juror generates determines the verdict. It is not made clear however whether jurors contemplate all the evidence and then decide upon the most appropriate story (Pennington and Hastie, 1992), or whether jurors make a very early decision as to guilt or innocence, and interpret all following evidence in the way of this initially decided verdict, as suggested by Huntley and Costanzo (2003).
