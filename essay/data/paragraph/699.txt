Qualitative research is theoretically research that leads to dichotomous results, i.e. data values of zero or one; however in psychology qualitative findings are usually those not arrived at by statistical methods, (Grohol, 2005). Methods are usually naturalistic and involve observing behaviour without manipulating variables. Qualitative methods are often thus considered less scientific than quantitative methods, yet they play a vital role in understanding behaviour in its natural environment and are frequently used to develop hypotheses and theories, giving exploratory analysis which can aid quantitative experimental design. Due to the inductive nature of qualitative research, however, it can only be a useful medium when explored in sufficient detail; therefore validity and reliability are critical to its utility.
