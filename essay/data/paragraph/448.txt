From the results it is clear that the bacteria could grow earlier on some plates than others. In this case the sample selective media lacking threonine (Plate 6) grew first at time 0minutes, then both plates lacking arginine (plate 1) and with xylose as the sugar (plate 7) at 15 minutes. The sample on plate 3, lacking isoleucine and valine was next to grow then plate 4 lacking leucine at 30 minutes. Plate 5 lacking proline showed growth at 60 minutes and finally plate 2 lacking histidine at 120minutes.
