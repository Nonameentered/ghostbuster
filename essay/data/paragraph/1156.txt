Relational studies have shown when correlating f-scale to various prejudice measures in South Africa the relation has been poor. The scale fails to explain prejudice in societies where prejudice is the norm (e.g. South Africa & Southern USA) as it only looks at the individual. Ray (1980) found a 0.59 correlation however, Orpen & Van der Schyff (1972) only found a 0.05 correlation. This implies that maybe the concept of authoritarianism would be more appropriate if it was applied only to societies where prejudice is normative.
