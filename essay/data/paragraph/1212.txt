It is important to bear on mind that what has been presented here is by no means a definitive list of the psychological effects present and is essentially a discussion of some of the most common aspects of dementia. In reviewing the literature, it appears that in the same way that the patient's illness develops and worsens with time, the same is paralleled in the caregiver's experience of the disease. In fact, there is often evidence for the characteristics of the patient being mirrored by the caregiver (Gilliard, 2001). Despite the alternative causes for the effects on caregivers offered in this essay (e.g. social role and gender), research has found that there are no significant differences in coping strategies between caregivers of dementia patients and of other illnesses (LeVesque, Ducharme and Lachance, 1999). Therefore it must be the nature of dementia, more specifically, its effects on the patient, that causes the increase in stress experienced by caregivers. However, there is very little current research on how these psychological effects on the patient directly effect the caregiver's well being. This is particularly important as not only do the effects on the patient have profound effects on the caregiver but as we have seen, these negative effects can also promote the caregiver to harm the patient, hence creating a vicious cycle. Therefore, we need further research to focus on how the psychological effects of dementia on the patient affect the caregiver's mental health, resulting in an integrative approach that would help improve the welfare of both the patient and the caregiver.
