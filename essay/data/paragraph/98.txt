In the unfolding chapter 13, which deals with variations of cognitive ability between ethnic groups, the book continues to provide the evidence for trends in intelligence difference between 'Asians' and 'Whites'. For this evidence, the book leans heavily upon the work of Lynn. A key claim, that IQ differences in the results are not generally found in culturally biased assignments, is here backed by only one source, Jensen. The work of this scholar, however, is certainly not uncontroversial and may even be racially motivated (Keenan 1999). Thus, where Murray and Herrnstein claim that 'there is no longer an important technical debate' (p. 282), Sternberg counters: 'To the extent that there is a consensus it is certainly not Herrnstein's and Murray's' (Miele 1995). Nonetheless, it is no more than fair to put forward Murray's response in the afterword of the book: 'Never mind that The Bell Curve draws its evidence from more than a thousand scholars. Never mind that among [the accused scholars] are some of the most respected psychologists of our time' (p. 564).
