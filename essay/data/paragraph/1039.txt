It must be remembered that Jews, as well as non-Jews perished during the Nazi holocaust, and it should be the latter's entitlement to share in the remembrance and mourning of the former. In a particularly volatile situation in 1988 Germany, Leah Ross, a journalist demanded that a memorial be set up for Jews alone. This provoked an outcry from Romani Rose of the Central Council of the Sinti and Roma that this 'represented a hierarchization of victims, which is insulting for the victims of the genocide and for the survivors of the Sinti and Roma majority." It would make sense in Israel to dedicate the memorial exclusively to Jews, but given the racial composition in Germany, it would be impertinent to do so.
