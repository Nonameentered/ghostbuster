The mediation of sporting practices (particularly violent sports) involves a complex and often contradictory relationship of identification and dissociation between male spectators from higher status backgrounds and the athletes themselves. The portrayal of sporting practices can be understood as naturalising the dominance of men over women, as media images of sport suppress the similarities between men and women and emphasise the differences, and then set about "weaving a structure of symbols and interpretations" around these differences to make them appear natural (Messner in Messner and Sabo, 1990; 101). Consequently, a sense of identification develops between male spectators and the images of sportsmen they consume which means that men identify themselves as physically superior to women; this sense of identification develops despite the fact that the majority of the male spectators are largely as physically dissimilar to professional male athletes as non-athlete females are (103). Conversely, the media representation of sporting practices also provides the male spectators with an image of a 'primitive other' embodied in the male athlete against whom he can define himself as modern and civilised (104). This sense of dissociation develops because the media representations portray images of sportsmen as predominantly black (and black men are historically associated with a notion of 'otherness'). It can be argued that the overrepresentation of ethnic minorities in sporting spheres is the result of a Therefore, media images of sporting practices serve to reinforce the hegemonic masculine ideals of dominating women and marginalising black men through portraying 'natural' differences between men and women, and through depicting the black male body as an animalistic force. However, black men are not merely passive recipients of a racist social order, and their agency in relation to masculinity and sport shall now be elaborated.
