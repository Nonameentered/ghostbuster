The professionalisation of medicine also affected women in a more personal way. As it ensured the exclusion of women from medicine it meant that women seeking medical help had to see a male doctor (Donnison, 1993), a change that caused problems especially in childbirth. It resulted in loss of dignity for women, as many did not wish to see a male doctor in such situations, resulting in many deaths as female midwives were not trained to deal with the problems, or meant that male surgeons had 'to work blind', under the covers, creating many errors (Donnison, 1993). This implication was significant, as it was so personal, and did not just affect women who wished to enter the medical profession but all female patients.
