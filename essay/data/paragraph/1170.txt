The balance between energy intake and expenditure is essential for maintaining body weight. Adrenergic hormones such as noradrenaline and adrenaline are released from the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in response to changes in body weight. If body weight is lost, this signals the SNS to reduce metabolic rate in order to create an energy positive balance in the body from which body weight can recover. Thus increases in SNS activity can induce a state of negative energy balance, resulting in weight loss. On the other hand, if body weight deviates above the configurable range and body fat is gained, this provides the hypothalamus with bidirectional signals from both the SNS and site of fat storage to reduce energy intake, and to increase energy expenditure by increasing the metabolic rate through stimulation of the SNS.  Appetite and eating behaviour is also regulated by certain receptors in the hypothalamus. These neurons have receptors that can detect leptin, a hormone that is secreted by fat cells. The level of leptin can be taken as an indicator of the amount of adipose tissue present in the body and it is thought to be the key to the body's overall energy balance. When the body's fat stores decrease the levels of leptin in the blood become reduced leading to an increase in appetite and a decrease in metabolism. When the fat stores are replenished the levels of leptin are restored to normal and the appetite and metabolism are suppressed (Rosenzweig, Breedlove & Leiman, 2002).
