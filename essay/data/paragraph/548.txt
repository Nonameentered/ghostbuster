However work by Peters and Kroon et al (9) has shown that some adult stem cells may be able to differentiate further than originally thought and can generate some cell types which were previously only achievable from pluripotent stem cells. This investigation into cell plasticity has had a major effect on the current stem cell field as it has raised the issue that some basic molecular changes may be sufficient to reprogram adult stem cells into a renewed state of totipotency and induce direct differentiation to multiple tissue types (9). As such this study and others have shown that stem cells are now generally divided into two separate categories, 'self-renewing stem cells' and a recently defined class of 'plastic-like stem cells' (9). Research by Goodell et al (10) further focused on the issue of adult stem cell plasticity by investigating the ability of hematopoietic stem cells to generate grafts with neural crest cell-like properties. When these grafts were co-cultured with neurosphere-forming neural hemprogenitors it was found that stem cells expressing myelin basic protein were generated. Goodell et al then proposed that these cells may not be haematopoietic-derived but rather could be generated from a sub-population of 'plastic-like' stem cells which had ability to reset themselves into a totipotent state and hence had the ability to differentiate into multiple cell types.
