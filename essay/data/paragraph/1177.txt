Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that regulates several vital mood processes in the body, including eating patterns. High levels of serotonin are associated with satiety, whereas reduced levels have been found to cause depression and also feelings of hunger. Therefore the body does its best to maintain a high level of serotonin. Serotonin is produced in the body via 5-Hydroxy Tryptophan (5-HTP). Its precursor, the amino acid tryptophan, can only be provided via the food we consume. As a result these foods tend to be craved by the body in order to elevate serotonin levels, and in turn improve mood. However, in order to have a significant effect on serotonin levels, the intake of these tryptophan-containing foods needs to be sufficiently high. Unfortunately, these foods tend to have a high carbohydrate and fat content. Evidence for this comes from the fact that obese individuals show low levels of serotonin and crave high carbohydrate foods to make themselves feel better (Wurtman & Wurtman, 1981).
