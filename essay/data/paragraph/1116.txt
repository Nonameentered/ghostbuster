The growth in population, and a corresponding increase in pressure on available land resources, was an important contributing factor to the social unrests. The population of China had tremendously increased in the end of the Eighteenth and the beginning of the Nineteenth century from 150 million to 400 million, yet the Yuan-Ming-Yuan could not reform the land distribution system, nor expand grain production via the building of canals, nor provide protection against natural calamities, all of which contributed to further deepening of poverty and exacerbation of social unrest across the nation. In particular, the revolt of the secret societies such as the White Lotus Society and the Triads in different parts of China between 1794-1850, saw the conversion of hundreds of thousands of members, and was fuelled by anti-dynastic sentiment, as well as hatred against the privileged class. Specifically, the most notorious group was the Taipings, who formed in 1845 by Hung Jen-Kan, and claimed to fulfil the will of God. One of its famous declaration was: 'The dynasty of Manchu evil doers is destroyed fall', and 'the mandate of Heaven is shifted to our movement', and quite obviously, the source of such royal challenge could not have originated from within a secure and well-ordered society.
