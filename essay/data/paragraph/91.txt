Though imperialism influenced Japan, there was also competition and challenge from within, as well as from external actors. This was based largely on the increased political awareness throughout the population, which consequently meant that 'increasingly complex and diverse forms of pressure from below propelled changes in the government too'. The Japanese belief that people were 'the foundation of the country' was reinforced through increased urbanization and the strength of the 'Put Yourself in Their Shoes' movement. This placed pressure on the state to reform in order to avoid change from occurring due to revolution. Consequently, the Meiji government was forced to Liberalise, and this ultimately led to the decreased authority of traditional patriarchs and the initiation of women's liberation. Furthermore, the subsequent imperialism and the success of victories such as the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 aided the cause of women, as it meant that the government was more likely to gain legitimacy from liberal reforms and was open to further domestication.
