The government reaction to the 1905 uprising was an important factor in why the Tsar was not overthrown. As Christopher Read points out, it was not necessarily the 'implications and nuances of the changes taking place' in 1905 which led to the unrest, it was more the fact that these changes '...were being contained within a stubbornly unchanging framework..." By easing this unchanging framework with the concessions made in reaction to the demonstrations, the government was able to maintain their position of power. Faced with sympathy strikes, general discontent from people of all classes, the dismay of other European countries, as well as a fear that the army's loyalty was lessening, the government was forced in to conceding to certain public demands. The October Manifesto was able to quell discontent to a large extent; the upper classes felt that they now had some control, whilst the lower classes felt that they had won a small victory on which they could build upon. The Manifesto, though using very vague terminology, and lacking the Tsars sincere approval, promised Russia a more democratic society; that this manifesto infact changed little, perhaps helped lead to a different outcome for the autocracy in 1917. However, the Manifesto's mixture of reassurance of the Tsars' care for his people, sorrow at their current situation, and assurance of future amendments proved enough to ease the political tension; at least for long enough to ensure the Tsar had ensured the safety of his position. 'The welfare of the Russian sovereign is inseparable from the welfare of the people. The turmoil and unrest...fill our heart with great and heavy sorrow... We grant the population unshakable foundations of civil liberties.'
