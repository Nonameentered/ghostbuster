The portrayal of sporting practices in the media reveals how specific types of masculinity that form the 'hegemonic masculinity' are glamorised and prioritised whilst other masculinities (and the men who enact them) are dismissed as deviant. The predominant image that emerges from the media representation of the male body is that a man should be muscular, athletic, powerful and healthy (Parker, 1996; 130). This perception emerges not only because of the extensive use of visual images of male athletes (who embody these physical ideals) but also because the male body exists at the intersection of sport, the media, and the consumer culture of society (130). Within contemporary society a culture has emerged that prioritises youth and beauty, and the portrayal of sportsmen in the media is part of the multiplicity of images and practices that individuals consume (such as yoga classes and healthy eating) in order to achieve these ideals (130). Therefore, the media representation of the male body shows how sport and the consumer culture are pivotal influences on the social construction of the hegemonic masculine ideal of physical prowess (as males who do not possess physical prowess are dismissed as inferior through the application of such labels as 'wimp') (132). Similarly, the masculine ideal of heterosexuality as the norm is reinforced by the media representation of sport. The depiction of homosexual male athletes is conspicuous largely because of its absence, and it can be argued that this is because there are comparatively few gay sportsmen (132). However, the relationship between the media and the dominant sporting culture of heterosexuality is more complex than this, as the media can be understood as actually Therefore, the media representation of the athletic male body and the normality of heterosexuality shows how sport is central to the social construction of these hegemonic masculine ideals as any alternative masculinities that do not feature in sport are labelled as inferior or ignored. The media representation of sport also contributes to the construction of the hegemonic masculine ideals of dominating women and the marginalisation of black men, and this relationship shall now be examined.
