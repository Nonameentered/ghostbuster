The vast majority of methods employed by PRA are people based and collective, which can give rise to the strength of networking. By speaking in an open forum opinions can be shared and criticisms can be voiced and hopefully aired with a greater sense of understanding. Moreover, by involving a large group of people the results are more likely to be representative. The large demands on the practitioner imply a need for substantial training and experience to ensure that the most appropriate methods are chosen and used effectively. Recognising local circumstances as a vital part of the analysis is also vital, especially the cultural context and history of the local area. PRA's could fail if the key differences in circumstances are ignored or underestimated.
