While this "professional" rationale placed a certain amount of order upon resident-staff interaction, it was also subject to "intimate" influences, which 'involve[d] unknowns of a less definable kind' (Wieder 1974: 161). These were instances of interpretation in which staff's own 'maintenance of the institution and [their] own role and security within it come to be very important' (Alexander 1987: 273). In such cases, 'the convictions and value-interpretations of the participant observer - [whereby] interpretations come to depend upon My own assessment of Wieder's account is that it highlights the largely tacit character of social "allocation". We are all familiar with the notion that in any kind of social interaction, norms are present which can be called upon in the interpretation of behaviour. In this case, we can see how, in the facility, the convict code, 'told' and 'untold by staff and residents alike, was somehow a guide for all participants' (Wieder 1974: 163). However, by focussing on the dependence of such interpretation, Wieder, by analogy, points to the ongoing negotiation of social meanings that takes place between the various social actors involved. Since 'meaning is not transferred from one person to another [...] but is constantly being constructed through interaction between [...] two people' (Coulter 1979: 11), the indexing proposed by ethnomethodology acknowledges a form of "tacit knowledge" that proceeds from the logic of everyday experience.
