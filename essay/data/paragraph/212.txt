One form of criticism of the general will draws parallels with the Jacobin rule during the French revolution. Both reveal traces of absolutist totalitarianism: 'It is absolutely necessary that evil come from others and from them alone'. Eastern block socialism, which has been suggested as imposing some for of a state-directed will upon its citizens, has been severely criticised. Lacking everywhere has been the binding together of lawgiver and subject, which according to Rousseau results only in the imposition a particular will of a state governed by a political elite.
