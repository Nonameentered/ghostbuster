The degeneration of the cells in the substantia nigra causes involuntary repetitive movements of the hand and arm, now known as Parkinson's disease. The cell bodies of dopamine that originate in the substantia nigra are no longer produced if the cells in the substantia nigra degenerate, this therefore causes a pronounced decrease in the dopamine content of the basal ganglia.
