The claim that the Great Patriotic War should be characterized as a people's war is very valid. The war effort needs to be seen as a combination of government and people. The government obviously provided leadership and policies for the movement of factories, the conscription of men and also won the war by creating a state of emergency throughout the country, which was occasionally enforced through repression. However, it was the people who made the war effort successful. They accepted the harsh government regulations and even though governed at a low-level, people still took their own initiative. The people worked hard, producing supplies and moving factories, as well as rebelling against the invading Germans. People's willingness to align themselves and cooperate with the national agenda cannot be underestimated.
