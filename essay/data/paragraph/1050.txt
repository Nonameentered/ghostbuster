To look at imperialism from a cynical point of view, it must be said that where economic and humanitarian interests were conflicting, the former would always triumph. Empirical observations regarding the sale of opium to Britain's Southeast Asian colonies, and that of 'trader gin' (a noxious but potent narcotic) in West Africa are telling of the priority of economic over humanitarian concerns. Abolishment of slavery was possible because it benefited both parties. Also, the presence of missionaries/explorers such as David Livingston could not compete with that of the international community of businessmen and investors. A very poignant example would be that of Belgium Congo, where King Leopold colonised it on the basis of 'humanitarian reasons', only to use the local population as slave labourers.
