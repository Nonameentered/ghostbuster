In addition, to a newborn's perceived knowledge of people, they also have knowledge concerning objects, although this appears to be more limited. Piaget (1954), argued that newborns have no 'structured' knowledge of objects and that they must learn it through experience. This 'transductive reasoning' (Piaget, 1954), was demonstrated in his A-not-B experiments, whereby a toy was repeatedly hidden in A and then the toy's position was changed to B. Initially, infants of 7 1/2 months reached for A where they had seen the toy before, indicating an insufficient understanding of object permanence; however, from 8 1/2 months they began to consistently search for the toy at B, which supported the fact that their knowledge and understanding of objects had developed over time.  But, what if a baby can do something without external influence? Does this mean that it is innate? By focusing on the usage of multiple senses in combination with each other, it is possible to better understand the newborn's 'knowledge of the outside world'.
