From this idea I can come up with a basic sketch of what I can expect from the design I am going to create: The design needs to be able to talk to other systems, so there must be some kind of communication protocol integrated within it. It should have longevity and be cost-effective, without compromising on quality or safety. The system should also be easily introduced into the existing air traffic control network.
