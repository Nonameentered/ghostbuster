Though all the colonial powers claimed to be civilising their colonies, it was 'only in republican France (that) this claim (was) elevated to the realm of official imperial doctrine." Nineteenth century France was the great missionary power of the Roman Catholic world, and it can be argued that the colonisation of Vietnam was partly the result of the French desire to protect their missionaries in Vietnam from official persecution. However, the French were unique in believing in the universality of French values, and the perfectibility of human kind, and this perception was not evident amongst the other European colonial masters, who generally, as a rule avoided 'over-education' of the natives.
