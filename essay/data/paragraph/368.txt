However, most subversive bomb cinema showed that the growing regimentation of corporate culture made man bereft of any genuine individual identity and sense of accomplishment. The most pertinent statement in Living in suburbia, 'the dormitory of the new generation of organization men', and working as a reluctant organization man in his brother's firm, Robert Carey finds little achievement in his life. In his ritual killing of the spider, Carey loses his fear of alienation from the group, experiencing a psychological transformation. In revealing, 'and then I meant something too... To God there is no zero', Carey asks the audience to embrace his liberation. In addition, the film shows that the famous sentence in the Communist Manifesto stating that the proletariat has nothing to lose but its chains has little relevance for the organization man. Robert Carey has something to lose conjecturally - his standard of living. Carey represents a wider metonym for contemporary American middle-class families who, having run up large debts, became trapped in the net of the bourgeois milieu.
