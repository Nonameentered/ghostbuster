In summary, I find it difficult to justify attributing Stalin's rise to power to one single factor. It is much more likely that a mixture of factors were important and that taken together they helped Stalin gain control. I have argued that the importance of Lenin's support was key, as it provided Stalin with his initial foothold in the party and provided the foundation from which to launch himself. Other factors which contributed to Stalin's ascendancy were his positioning and standing within the party hierarchy, the cult of Leninism created by Stalin and maintained by Stalin after his death, the contradictions in the politics and personalities of Stalin's rivals and most significantly the mistakes of his opponents during this time including the underestimation of Stalin and the failure to recognise the threat which Stalin posed.
