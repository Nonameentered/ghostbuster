It may be that all the heterozygous carriers used in the study did have tetrachromatic vision, it was just that cDa7 had shifted opsins far enough away from the original cones required from trichromacy, to be detected by such behavioural techniques. Overall however, it suggests that even if all the heterozygous carriers do have tetrachromatic vision which has not been picked up by the tests, their vision cannot be considerably different to that of a trichromatic's vision.
