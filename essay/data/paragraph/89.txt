way in which the subordination of women could be challenged, yet did not always transfer successfully to greater political action. An education in Western ideologies was also believed by many as the only means for Japan to become a civilised and powerful nation and was included as a principal goal within the 1889 Educational law. However, this newly-adopted western educational system turned out to favour men over women by alienating the cultural values of gender equality that had been the norm previously. Therefore, although the educational system was intended to foster social mobility, it 'effectively disadvantaged women.' The dispute between modernity and tradition was fiercely debated by proponents of both sides. The introduction of industrialisation and modernisation contained inherent contradictions, potentially offering more autonomy yet also providing new ways in which it could be restricted. This explains the dilemma many women saw themselves in and their eventual organisation; the move from traditional to modern concepts of thought led to a profoundly increased level of political awareness. The struggle for progress without subordinating the position of women inspired many women, particularly intellectuals, to take the first steps towards formally organised feminist groups.
