It appears then that behaviour therapy, in its many forms, can be a useful and well-used form of treatment for some psychological disorders but is rarely recommended as the sole treatment for any mental health problems. In general terms, behaviourism is an effective approach only when used along side other therapies and treatments, including cognitive therapy, counselling or even pharmacological prescriptions. The strictly behavioural approach is only successful in more minor cases of disorders such as posttraumatic stress, anxiety disorders or phobias. Any long term, deeply rooted disorders require careful examination of causes and the mental processes which accompany observable behaviour. It might be said that taken alone behaviour therapy is as effective as other popular therapies alone (Smithal. 1980), but the best approach is a more diverse mixture of psychoanalytic theory, medical treatment and cognitive behaviour therapy.
