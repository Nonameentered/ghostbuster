This discourse, as well as placing motherhood as natural and essential for defining women, also ensures that women in society without children, both voluntarily and involuntarily, are seen as failed and not proper women. Culture also dictates that those who do not have children are selfish and immoral (Gillespie, 2001), and motherhood is seen as a signifier of normality (Morrell, 1994). Women feel that they should fit in with what is 'normal and natural', meaning that they chose to have children. These ideas are evident in social policy. As the nation relies on reproduction for its continuation, the state has much interest in levels of fertility and tries to encourage women to reproduce. This is done by reinforcing the discourses of motherhood as natural, and through more explicit social policy. This is evident in the USA where abortion and contraception are closely controlled by the state to ensure that women consider having children as important (McDaniel, 1996).
