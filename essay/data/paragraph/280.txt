The comparison of the ontological perspectives of Individualism and Collectivism highlights the flaws of each. Individualists claim that social reality can be best explained at the level of individual action, as this is where social reality is ultimately created (37). This is reflected in their methodological approach; that of 'reductionism' whereby social structures (which cannot be empirically proven) are reduced to statements about individuals (38). Collectivists disprove this reductionist methodology by suggesting that social structures are accountable for social phenomena independently of individuals, and thus have the potential to shape individuals (in terms of their behaviour) (41). Nevertheless, whilst Collectivism successfully disproves the methodological adequacy of Individualism, it cannot refute Individualism's ontological premise because Collectivism is legitimised by an equally impoverished ontological position.
