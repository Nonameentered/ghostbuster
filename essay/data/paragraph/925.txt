In the present study we were particularly concerned with the relationship between avoidance coping and alcohol consumption with respect to how university students cope with a high academic workload. It is widely acknowledged that university students represent a group of individuals who have unique drinking patterns (O'Hare, 1997). Drinking is a large part of university culture, and heavy or problematic drinking among students represents a major public health concern (Ham & Hope, 2003), with young adults aged 18-24 showing the highest rates of alcohol use and having the greatest percentage of problem drinkers in the population (Rabow & Duncan-Schill, 1995). However, at the same time university students are frequently confronted by stressful periods when they have a large amount of work to do, with assignments to complete, deadlines to meet and exams to prepare for. This poses a potential problem since their generally high levels of drinking suggest that university students may be particularly likely to exhibit avoidance coping in stressful situations, and thus, if alcohol fosters the use of avoidant coping to such an extent that more adaptive coping strategies such as active problem solving are excluded, it may lead to maladaptive functioning in important life domains such as academic achievement (Windle & Windle, 1996). A positive correlation between levels of avoidance coping and alcohol consumption may therefore suggest that individuals who drink more at university are more likely to deny the importance of work they have to do, perhaps leave it until the last minute, and subsequently exhibit lower grades than those who drink less and are subsequently more able to employ more successful problem-focused strategies.
