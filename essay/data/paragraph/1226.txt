Evidence advocating the sequential line-up has resulted in the sequential-superiority effect; that is the procedure produces a higher ratio of accurate identifications to mistaken identifications than a simultaneous line-up (Wells, 2001). However, sequential line-ups are also approached with criticism. Gonzalezal. (1993) has proposed that showups (i.e. the presentation of a single suspect) may be a better method of identification as they also lead to absolute judgements, and despite Lindsay and Wells's (1985) claim that accurate identifications are unaffected in suspect-present line-ups; these identifications have been found to decrease by others (cited in Ebbeson and Flowe, 2002). In light of this, Ebbeson and Flowe (2002) have suggested that sequential line-ups, rather than initiating absolute judgements, merely raise the criteria for making a positive identification, as witnesses become more cautious of their decision. In response, Wells (2001) now claims that sequential line-ups include both absolute and criterion judgements. Regardless of the type of identification process incurred, it remains apparent that a sequential line-up would have reduced the chances of Webster being misidentified, especially as Maryland courts appear reluctant to use sequential line-ups (Willing, 2002).
