The initial important step in Stalin's eventual Premier's post was taken when Lenin appointed him to the newly created post of General Secretary to the Central Committee in 1922. Prior to his appointment as General Secretary, Stalin had been a loyal follower of Lenin and had received a great deal of support from Lenin both personally and politically. He had done important work behind the scenes for the party and was trusted by Lenin to get things done. He had been appointed to the Politburo in 1919 and again in 1920/21 and was also Central Committee Secretary during this time. Lenin became ill during 1922 making it vital he had someone managing the party in his absence; Stalin was chosen despite objections from most other members of the Politburo. He was particularly disliked by Trotsky who predicted after Stalin's appointment as General Secretary what this would eventually mean for Party politics. It appears that one of the main reasons Lenin appointed Stalin to the post, and to other important positions was loyalty. Stalin had 'lacked original independent views and wide ideas on the construction of socialism', and never waivered in his backing for Lenin, making him a safe and useful choice for such posts in a time of uncertainty.
