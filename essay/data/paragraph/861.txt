This is quite different to the research conducted by Huntley and Costanzo (2003). They found that two jurors can create different stories for the same evidence, a characteristic of the story board model, although their research is focused upon the story generation after evidence has been collected and presented to the jury. To do this Huntley and Costanzo (2003) conducted an experiment in which two participants were asked to review the evidence of a fictitious rape trial. Half of the participants were assigned the role of the prosecution and the other half the role of the defence.
