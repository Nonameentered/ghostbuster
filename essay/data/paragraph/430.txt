th century, Lynn Sagan provided an explantation on the origin of eukaryotic organelles called endosymbiotic theory. This proposed that the organelles in the cells, such as mitochondria, chloroplasts and possibly hydrogenosomes, resulted from anaerobic bacteria being engulfed (endocytosis) by a larger eukaryotic host cell and a mutual beneficial relationship eventually forming between them. The endosymbiont became specialized for its metabolic roles and was dependent on the host for its survival. Over time, the endosymbiont became incorporated into the host cell and the two became so dependent on each other that they could no longer function apart.  When first proposed, the endosymbiotic theory encountered immediate resistance; as it suggested that some of the organelles of eukaryotic cells were derived from microbes via endocytosis, which was at that time impossible. Furthermore, the rejection was because the concept of endosymbiosis defied the scale of conventional evolutionary thinking of species, with its insistence that important steps in the evolution of eukaryotes developed from within cells, rather than between species However, as the field of Molecular Biology advanced, more evidence in support of the endosymbiotic theory had been collected Inner organelles, such as the mitochondria are shaped like bacteria, with the same size, have a similar variety of enzymes, and even possess a circular DNA, like prokaryotes As photosynthetic organelles, chloroplasts also have several components, which are reminiscent of cyanobacteria, such as enzymes of photosynthesis, thylakoid membrane with chlorophyll and its kin, and the mechanism of the light reaction This ability to photosynthesise by chloroplasts is so important that it changed the Earth's atmosphere by converting it from anaerobic to oxygenated atmosphere and continues today, by driving the global carbon cycle  As photosynthesis is essential for the existence  Widespread among all eukaryotes, the number of flagella and cilia of eukaryotes, commonly referred to as undulipodia, were found to be distinct from bacterial flagella, which have helical filaments.
