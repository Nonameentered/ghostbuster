The positions Stalin held within the party were of such importance in handing him the power he required. There was Stalin's position as communist party General Secretary in 1922 which Lenin had supported and which allowed him control over the bureaucracy. He was also in control of the TsKK Secretariat; giving him the power to control those organisations which were essentially mediators with the press. Stalin's control of the unit distributing culture and education provided him with potential to fashion the parties opinions to his designs. He was Chairman of the Supreme Council of the National Economy (Vesenkha) allowing him control over the necessary apparatus in terms of economic and industrial reform. With experience in handling the Comintern and membership of the expanding Politburo, in a few years Stalin had placed himself in a position where '...power could pass to him without bloodshed...'.
