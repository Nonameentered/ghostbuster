This exclusion of women can also be traced in the area of midwifery. Until the twentieth century midwifery was viewed as a female responsibility, being viewed as inferior to other areas. Although from the 1700s onwards there were several man-midwives, they did not deal with routine births, stepping in only if there was a problem; their role was similar to that of a surgeon (Donnison, 1993). However post-1730's their role changed, and they became increasingly involved in routine births, especially with the upper and middle classes. What was seen as 'a problem birth' was redefined, for example prior to this time breech births were regarded as normal, and female midwives considered able to deal with them competently, but as they came to be seen as a problem, male surgeons began to participate in an increasing number (Oakley, 1984).
