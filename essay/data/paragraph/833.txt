Popularity is an extremely difficult concept to measure as popularity is variable across cultures and ages. Characteristics defining a child as popular at the age of 8 may not be the same characteristics which define a child as popular at 14. Another problem arises distinguishing friendship from popularity. A child may be perceived as unpopular but still have a few close friends, and it is important to consider this when looking at psychological development because popularity is multi-faceted as opposed to one dimensional. It has been shown that unpopular children are more likely to have psychological difficulties such as schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, mood disorders and criminal behaviour (Kupersmidt, Coie and Dodge, 1990). Because of this, an important issue when looking at the effect of popularity on psychological development is cause and effect. This issue is covered extensively in the essay as it is valuable, yet difficult, to try and determine whether being unpopular causes problems with psychological development, or whether underlying psychological difficulties cause the child to behave inappropriately and become unpopular.
