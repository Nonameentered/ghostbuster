Ultimately, it can be seen that a varied combination of changing social and political factors led to the development of feminism in Japan. Through increased political awareness and changing structures within the government, women were able to challenge their position for the first time. In the national struggle for increased economic and military power, gender identities were redefined in order to benefit the state. Women were arguably used in this process before being liberated themselves. Thereby, 'in the process of refusing subordinate status [as a nation], Japan constructed a new womanhood as a demonstration of its equality with the West and as a means of proving its civilised status'.
