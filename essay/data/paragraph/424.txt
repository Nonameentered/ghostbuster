Part of the endosymbiotic theory states that the eukaryotic undulipodia, which is the eukaryotic motility organelles: flagella and cilia may have arisen from endosymbiotic spirochete bacteria Both cilia and flagella are made of microtubules and they are involved in mobility of the cells, for example in sperms or in moving fluid past the cells: ciliated epithelial cells that line our air passages and move a film of mucus towards the throat The basal bodies from which eukaryotic cilia and flagella develop would have been able to create the mitotic spindle, is therefore involved in mitosis. Cilia have many short microtubules and flagella have very long microtubules. Their movement is created as the microtubules slide past one another and the energy for this movement comes from ATP These undulipodia are made up of a cylindrical array of 9 evenly spaced microtubules, with motor molecules of dynein linking the adjacent microtubules together. The microtubules consist of several closely related proteins called tubulins As these whip-like undulipodia are common in eukaryotes but are not found in prokaryotes they are thought to have derived from still another group of free-living bacteria, the modern spirochetes This is, however the most controversial and most argued past of the endosymbiotic theory. According to Margulis, the undulipodia may be derived from bacteria through motility symbioses and this suggestion was referred to as the exogenous hypothesis. Even though the details of the argument are complicated the evidence supporting this hypothesis lies in the biology of the organelles themselves, their distribution, and the occurrence of related and analogous structures. On the other hand, another suggestion proposed that undulipodia originated internally as an extension of the microtubules, which are involved in mitosis, in a hypothesis referred as direct filiation or endogenous hypothesis, which is the non-symbiotic view of evolution that emphasises the role of various types of mutations in the evolutionary separation of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells
