The work of Simmel on the discipline of sociology is an attempt to construct a sociological system based on the individual standpoint. Simmel argued that society is composed of 'forms-of-sociation' (Simmel 1971a: 22), which are a reciprocal relation between two or more social actors, essentially based on a tension between opposite drives within each individual actor. This separation of form and content gave Simmel a useful tool to understand the intricacy of social interaction between individuals. Furthermore, Simmel has been criticised for his strict reductionism and focus on the microsocial aspects of social interaction, leaving out the external social force of society over the individual. Nevertheless, his work is important in that it stresses the "humanistic coefficient" of social interaction, and provides an immediacy to the sociology of everyday interactions.
