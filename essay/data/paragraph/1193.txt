Despite the presence of these components of perception in neonates, clearly behaviour still has a great developmental trajectory beyond birth. Newborns initially show a vague sense of size constancy but begin to focus more on the size and 3D aspects of objects. At 6 weeks infants focus on the incomplete shape of a partially hidden object, and even at 4 months infants have some sense of object permanence (Elkind, 1962, in Spelke, 1990). By 10 months their ability to represent objects in mental images has improved significantly and spatial relationships can be inferred from the 2D array (Diamond & Carey, 1984).
