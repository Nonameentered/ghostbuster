Radkey's claim is valid. The Civil War in Russia between the Reds and Whites was ultimately overshadowed by the struggle between the Bolsheviks and the Greens, a popular movement led by the peasants. The Bolsheviks relied on workers to run production and the railways, many of whom were members of the Greens, meaning they could revolt and cause serious damage to the Reds. The Greens consisted of anarchists, peasants, workers and nationalists and often revolted to gain political freedom, food and more control of their land. They would enlist the aid of soldiers for their cause. The Bolsheviks attempted to introduce the New Economic Policy in order to reduce the peasant uprisings and although it failed, it illustrates the power of the popular movement. The Bolsheviks relied on propaganda to keep the people of Russia in line however there were still many strikes and protests indicating the threat posed by the Greens was strong. The Bolsheviks had to make changes to appease the people, showing the war between the Bolsheviks and the peasants was a struggle against popular opinion. The White Army, although powerful, was ultimately divided and poorly organised and lacked the communication network the Reds had. A victory against the Greens was unlikely and it was the threat of popular opinion that gave the Reds control over the people of Russia after defeating the White Army.
