Gary K. Waite has remarked that certain aspects of Davis's work is brilliant, but that it has become "bogged down by personal animosities and the lack of fresh interpretations" In particular, the fault line between Davis and his other historians seems to be a heated argument between the 'Ranter' concept and 'Ranter' mythology. Davis denies the existence of the 'Ranters', even though many of his contemporaries contest this. His primary argument is that the existence of the 'Ranters' as an organised subversive sect, as theorised by Christopher Hill seems, in his words, an "imaginary seventeenth-century religious and cultural phenomenon". Hill ; Christopher Hill has suggested that the 'Ranter' core was a fusion of two strands of antinomianism-Coppe and Salmon- and a later radical attempt to demonstrate as clearly as practicably possible that Christ was the only Lord and law-giver.' While Davis contends that the phrase "all shalbe Ransome's" was ambiguous and not sufficiently precise in locating a specific group, he fails to take into account the 'ground-horn' effect the phrase had, referring to popular 'Ranting' (and near-hysterical) behaviour. Hill maintains that the same phrase was also used by Coppe and showed that the "somewhat flexible boundaries between the Ranters' and other radical sects" and demonstrates the lack of a distinguishing feature between them. Davis's failure to differentiate between 'Ranter' myth and 'Ranters' is blinding him from seeing the evidence of links between Coppe, Salmon and Webb, of which Hill has been a persuasive advocate.
