The final factor to consider in this question are the effects of Hitler's 'charismatic rule' on the resistance movement. With the Fuhrer so popular and the extent of his backing so seemingly unscalable, one would be forgiven for denying the existence of any notable resistance during Hitler's reign. However, resistance from individualists and Marxists, both from within and outside Germany existed, though in small doses, and were largely ineffective. This resistance can be explained to stem in part from the totalitarian state, as well as the authority of the Fuhrer. According to one historian, the 'Hitler Myth' deteriorated as Germany suffered successive military defeats, and a fall in Hitler's expansive promises. There was amongst some sections of society, a realisation that the Nazi dictatorship would eventually lead to disaster, and only more suffering and economic hardship. This disillusionment also paralysed certain elements, who were then inclined to 'Keep themselves out of anything that might land them in trouble with the Nazis.'
