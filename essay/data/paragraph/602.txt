The reasons why the revolution of 1905 did not bring about an overthrow of the Tsar can be split in to two categories; those which were caused by the regime and those externally dependent factors. One of the key arguments made by historians in understanding why the Tsar was not overthrown in 1905 is that he still had some support from some sectors of the populous. By introducing a number of reforms (including the October Manifesto) along with a somewhat stiff upper lip in the face of extreme humiliation, the Tsar was able to retain some of his subject's loyalty. Arguably it could be said that those with whom the Tsar retained support were of a higher social class which many Russians would not identify with. Nonetheless, support was support, and with the likes of the Church, capitalists, and the educated middle class still in the Tsar's corner, a lot of people could be still won back. Historians such as Christopher Read emphasise the Tsars ability to 'blame' people other than himself for the current state of unrest; for example the famous 'ministerial scapegoating' and blame of the Jews for all of Russia's misfortunes allowed him to remain impartial. These scapegoats were often those of a lower social class, and thus more easily abused from a political point of view; creating a somewhat supportive climate of "Russia must remain united". Various other causes given for the 'failure' of 1905 include economic depression (with some areas heavily dependent upon particular market presence) and the attitude of the army who essentially remained loyal to the Tsar throughout
