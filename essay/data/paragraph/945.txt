The 1971 Stanford Prison Experiment was a classic demonstration of the power of social situations to distort personal identities and long cherished values and morality as normal healthy males internalized situated identities in their roles as prisoners and guards. This psychological condition was clearly demonstrated in a particular episode with the prisoners. Prisoners were told if they wanted to leave the prison, they would have to go through a parole hearing. When the prisoners were asked whether they would forfeit the money they had earned up to that time if they were to be paroled, most said yes. This proves that the money was not a factor in their obedience. However when the hearings were ended by the parole officers telling the prisoners to go back to their cells while their request were being considered, every prisoner obeyed, even though they could have obtained the same result by simply quitting the experiment. Why did they obey? Because they felt powerless to resist. By this stage, the prisoners were immersed too deeply in their restrictive roles to realise that the officers had turned down their request as prisoners but not as a free human being. Their sense of reality had shifted, and they no longer perceived their imprisonment as an experiment. The participants were deindividuated and recognised their status only as prisoners, not as paid experimental participant. This led to their blind compliance and unquestionable obedience to their orders.
