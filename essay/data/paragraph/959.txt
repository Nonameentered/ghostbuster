A method that is similar to systematic desensitization is In Vivo Exposure. With In Vivo Exposure the patient is subjected to the actual anxiety-producing situations. The patient is slowly put in the situations starting with the least feared one with the help of their therapists. Eventually, the patient will have to physically face their fear and feel anxious about and anxiety. This is effective as there is a constant sense of reality throughout the treatment. In addition, it allows the patients to gradually get used to their fear and anxiety. A problem with this method is that unless the patient is willing to let themselves be in their feared situation, it is very difficult to implement this method. It is also a lengthy process and patients may not be willing to follow through with all the required sessions. (Atkinson, R. L., Atkinson, R. C., Smith, E. E., Bem, D.
