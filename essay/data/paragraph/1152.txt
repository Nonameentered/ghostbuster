The results showed that those with higher f-scores were more likely to be anti-Semitic and less tolerant of minority groups. This led Adorno to the conclusion that these individuals possess an authoritarian personality.  The authoritarian personality theory has been criticised in recent times on various levels. Firstly, due to cultural diversity the theory has been accused of being too culturally bound. Eysenck (1966) suggests that authoritarianism is governed by genes, and therefore country of origin should not be significant. He advocates the use of biological rather than cultural explanations.  The second major criticism is the acquiescence bias which is seen in the f-scale. Gabennesch (1972) found that those who said “Undecided” to a number of questions were consistently better at problem solving than those who had strong opinions. This suggests that high f-scale scores may not represent authoritarianism but instead may just be an indication of a narrow world view or an inability to think freely.
