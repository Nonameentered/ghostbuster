In order to establish the role low self-esteem and having to integrate a new peer group has to play in fuelling eating deviancy, the present study used a between subjects design. It explored whether first year university females had significantly more disordered eating than a control group of non university females of the same age. Two universities were recruited for the experimental group: Queen Mary and the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts. As the University already sets up a peer group for their students a control group living in the local area was not used for the purpose of the experiment. The control group were females of the same age as the experimental group recruited from a university open day. This approach was taken as it was felt participants would be more likely to story accurately when responding to questionnaires on eating habits, body satisfaction and self esteem as they were not aware of the aims of the study.
