Linked to the Postmodernist agenda, class has also come under scrutiny from political historians, such as Frank Parkin. They claim that Marx's triadic society of classes, particularly the two 'great hostile camps' of proletariat and bourgeoisie, outlined in the Communist Manifesto, were historically over-simplified abstractions and it is impossible to locate precisely the politically relevant line of cleavage. This argument has gained momentum in the light of recent political claims that 'we are all middle class' The working class, severed from the symbolism of old labour movements and increasingly a white-collar composite, has been absorbed into the middle class. This is emblematic in John Prescott's opinion that he is 'anything else than middle class now' However, in spite of this, class remains a valuable dividing line. Firstly, concentration on headline reductive aspects represents a perverted reading of Marxist class theory. In the Eighteenth Brumaire, Marx recognised the existence of other classes but simply felt that 'of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the proletariat alone is the really revolutionary class' Secondly, it is possible to locate lines of cleavage in modern social structures, even if it means abandoning previous Marxist reductive forms. For example, the emergence of a new Super-Class, born in the financial world of London, and a new underclass, living in a permanent state of dependence, are indicative of a reconfigured class structure. Although it is arguably harder to identify, class remains a useful measurement of social hierarchies.
