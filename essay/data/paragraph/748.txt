The effects of the Black Death on the church were great. There was a decrease in pilgrims, which meant a fall in the funds of religious institutions and also a decrease in 'jury services, tithes, bequests and fines' Parsons were unimpressive and 'ecclesiastical discipline slackened' There was a decrease in church attendance, besides special religious services. For example, in the years before 1340, at least 24,000 people flocked to Tournai cathedral on Good Friday. Only 800 was this number present in 1350.
