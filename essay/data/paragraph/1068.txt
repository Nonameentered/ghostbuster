The second and arguably the most pertinent issue in this debate is the existence or otherwise of the 'Ranters'. This brings us to the heart of the matter-Davis denies the existence of the 'Ranters' whereas the the other historians, such as Hill and Aylmer, assert that they did exist. Hill places 'Ranterism' in a broad historical context and links it with Anabaptism and Familism, drawing similarity between the three, such as the emphasis on immediacy, an otherworldliness regarding conventional ethics and a "clandestine or semi-clandestine character" Davis on the other hand, denies the existence of the 'Ranters' despite the sporadic evidence that points towards their existence. He is in particular, prejudiced against seventeenth century pamphlets, making the valid point that very often these pamphlets were written as propaganda to consolidate support for the different sides in the longdrawn Civil War. Nonetheless, these pamphlets can be used as sources of information of what was believed by historians as well as contemporaries. Both sides agree that there is a lack of evidence as to the practices of the 'Ranters', yet Hill and Aylmer are predisposed to trusting those sources that speaks of 'practical antinomianism' such the refusal to pay tithes and engage in illegal marriages, whereas Davis treats these sources with extreme scepticism.
