The observation that infants possess some comprehension of other people's thoughts and intentions prior to language development, must imply the existence of other mind-reading abilities, for instance, the understanding of behavioural intentions. A study by Amso & Johnson (2006) looked into this idea, by using a 'climbing apparatus', an infant friendly tripod apparatus. The experimenter initially used the apparatus to climb legs firstly over a gap and then underneath it and these actions were repeated four times with two different lures. By measuring the latency to crawl over and under the apparatus it was found that 13-month-olds had a greater tendency to crawl over the gap when the experimenter had done this compared with when she had crawled below it. This discrepancy indicates the infants were making judgement about the goal of the adult in the experiment thus inferring her intention, which suggests possession of a rudimentary 'theory of mind'.
