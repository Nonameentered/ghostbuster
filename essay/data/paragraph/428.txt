Reduced genome size The genome of the original symbiont reduces over time, as it transfers gene information to the nucleus of the host cell This transfer of the gene is a major confirmation of the endosymbiotic theory, as this gradual shift in the gene content of the bacteria is seen in many different organelles compared to related free-living bacterial genomes, and another major characteristic that supports the endosymbiotic theory is the close similarity of presequence from the organellar DNA to those present in bacteria, although this similarity is not always conclusive evidence Furthermore, although the organellar DNA codes for some of the proteins, the majority are coded from the nuclear chromosome Passage of small substances The endosymbiotic relationships between the host and the organelles can be demonstrated by the transport of small substances The processes of protein and nucleic acid transport and many enzymes, such as ATP synthase, require the passage of small molecules, which are known to be mediated by specific transport proteins. The transport of small molecules is much greater in mitochondria, where most of the other enzymes are located The presence of porins is another confirmation of the endosymbiotic theory and is the ending of both internal and external membrane of the mitochondria and chloroplasts. Porin channel protein allows all molecules 100 Da to pass through them, which explains why ATP, for example, can pass through the internal membrane of mitochondria Other evidences, such as the presence of cardiolipin, which is a diphosphosphingolipid found only in mitochondria, support the endosymbiotic theory. Cardiolipin is not found in either the nuclear or the cytoplasmic membrane of eukaryotes, showing that, as mentioned earlier, the inner membrane of mitochondria is evolutionary very ancient. Other evidences The evolutionary trend which all photosynthetic organisms use within chloroplasts is known as the Z-scheme, which consists of two photochemical steps: The light dependent reaction and light independent reaction (The Calvin cycle). This type of photosynthetic electron transport chain, first found in cyanobacteria, is not present or used by any free-living bacteria, let alone any photosynthetic archaea, which is another supportive evidence for the endosymbiotic theory Additionally, a further similarity between mitochondria and chloroplast to their respective bacterial relatives is the use of F-ATP synthetase, which is present in prokaryotes, and comprises of F (FO) and V (V-ATPase) domains, but absent in the cytoplasmic part of eukaryotes. This again supports the idea of endosymbiosis
