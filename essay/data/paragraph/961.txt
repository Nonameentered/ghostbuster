Modeling is another effective means of changing behaviour. It is the process by which a patient observed someone's behaviour and learning and imitating it. Perhaps one of the most evidentiary supports for this method comes from a study by Bandura, Ross and Ross in 1961. They did a study on transmission of aggression through imitation of aggressive models. It was concluded that humans learn from imitation and therefore it provides grounds for this method to be used. An advantage of this method is that as the patient is watching someone else in the feared situation, they are being exposed to it without being actually in the situation. They are not physically being hurt unlike In Vivo Exposure. A disadvantage is that the patient may be comfortable watching someone else in the situation but may not be able to handle being in the actual situation themselves. Additionally, this method is basing on people who are easily influenced into imitating. If this patient has a very strong sense of self, they might not be so susceptible to this method. Furthermore, if there is a reason for this fear and feel anxious about and anxiety, it might have cognitive reasons behind it and by not addressing it, this form of therapy might merely be suppressing it.
