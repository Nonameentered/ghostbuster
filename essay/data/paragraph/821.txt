It may be therefore that what this study shows is that moving away from home for the first time, and having to integrate a new peer group, may not be cause for disordered eating pattern, but that it acts to increase existing problems individuals may already have. This is suggested by the moderate negative correlation between EAT and SERS (19.98% shared variance, r = -0.44) for the experimental group. This may show that individuals already have low self esteem, which does contribute to disordered eating behaviours, although it may be that moving away from home heightens this feeling and as a result increases the disordered eating.
