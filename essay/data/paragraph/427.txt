The double-membrane structure and genetic evidence in present-day mitochondria and chloroplasts are very convincing arguments supporting the endosymbiotic theory As these organelles are surrounded by two membranes, the outer membrane is akin to the Gram-negative bacteria and the inner membrane is somewhat similar to the Gram-positive bacteria. This double membrane formation (Figure 4) can be explained by the endosymbiotic theory that a eukaryote engulfed one or more Gram-negative bacteria (others propose a Gram-positive) which later became surrounded by a second membrane (forming the inner membrane) to give some protection and maintained their size and shape as the eukaryotic membrane began to form the outer membrane
