Stem cell research is being investigated to develop technologies to grow, differentiate and use stem cells in medicine to cure a variety of different diseases and medical conditions as was first suggested by Thomas in 1979 (1). With features such as their potential to proliferate without limit and their plasticity allowing them to form different cell types, such studies are generating keen interest and making tangible the potential of cell-based treatments.
