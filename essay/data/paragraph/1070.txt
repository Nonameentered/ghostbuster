It is not my intention to decide who is right in this debate, but rather to try and bring some understanding of the issues at hand. While it is clear that Davis disagrees with Morton and Hill on many counts, we should not write off Davis's hypotheses off as baseless. There is, however, much inconsistency in Davis's own arguments which weakens his standing in the debate, for example, his accusations of using theory to construct history and presenting facts as evidence of theory can be equally applied to him. Davis's distaste for the labelling of the 'Ranters' as a collective and his belief in separate individual identities sheds light on his conception of the 'Ranters' as a sect-as opposed to a movement-as well as hinting as to his own conception and beliefs about how society should be ordered and function. As Roger Thomas has pointed out, Davis's own view of ""the fragmentation and atomisation of Ranter association", has its own resonance in the sense of atomisation of individual experience and interest within contemporary society.
