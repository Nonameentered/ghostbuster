Evidence exists which negates the need for concern over aggression shown on films and television. Savage (2004) highlighted the problems that arise when one is too quick to blame the media for aggressive behaviour in children. While she admits that research has shown links between violence on television and violence in real life, she believes many of these links to be correlations rather than causal effects. Savage argues that children with aggressive tendencies prefer violent programmes, and states that effects of television are hard to measure. They can occur in subtler ways in later life, which may be difficult to observe in overt behaviour. Finally, she states that the role of the child's parents, peers and school life as well as biological factors are more likely to be the overriding factors that contribute towards displayed aggression. Savage places the effects of media low on the list. Jenkins (1999), supports this, and states that real life will always have a more profound effect on behaviour than television will. Hodge and Tripp (1986) believe that television can not be solely blamed for aggressive behaviours in children, and that it is imperative to consider socio-economic status and situational factors, challenging the somewhat reductionist social learning approach. They reason that children perceive television as a mode of entertainment, not as a source of information about the world. They argue further that what a child views is not infallible - it has the ability to be corrected and put into context by others, namely through socialisation with parents and peers. Hamilton (1998), supports this view, stating that television only exacerbates other more influential factors, rather than having its own direct effect.
