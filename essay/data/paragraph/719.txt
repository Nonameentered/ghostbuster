Whilst Lombroso's theory provides a basis for Wilde's descriptions, Lombroso believed that such criminal traits were in-born and innate, a result of a past century environment. Therefore in order to create an end to the story with both a sense of culpability and of demise, Wilde required to expose his character to a progressively decaying environment after his initial wish for eternal youthfulness. Sybil Vane's death and the growing despair of Gray, as he views his portrait, determine the ultimate conclusion- suicide. Having painted the atmosphere rather than the physicality of Lombroso's beliefs into the denouement, Wilde creates a fall from grace much more realistic from the standpoint of a modern reader.
