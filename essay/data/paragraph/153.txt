The first traces of the humanist movement can be discerned in the works of Petrarch. An Italian scholar and poet, Petrarch considered the works of classical writers such as Cicero to be the essence of a Christian life, a life which should be 'well spent and guided by faith'. Similarly, Erasmus' own humanist pursuits concentrated on correcting the pedantry of medieval teachings - a project which was to lead to its own reformation. While Italy was an important center of humanist activity, among other places, Germany had its own flourishing tradition of humanistic scholarship. The most notable figures of this German academic movement were Ulrich von Hutten and Conrad Celtis. Hutten was a poet who praised the German language and its past; Celtis, in addition to contributing to the national anthropological discourse, was also a prolific scholar, teacher and publisher of books. The works of both authors formed an important part of the national humanist legacy which Germany bequeathed to the reformation movement.
