In order to replicae and cause disease the bacteria must take numerous steps to traverse from the atmosphere to the alveolar macrophages of the host. In order to do this, The bacteria must utilize the energy of movement and proteins to traverse mucins and other host cell proteins to enter the host cell and infect. A particular virulence factor important of this traversal is the In order for the bacteria to gain entry into the alveolar macrophage it must attach itself to the macrophage and uptake must occur to initiate an infection. The characterised ankyrin-repeats found in the region of amino acids 2-137 (Cotter & Barry, 1998) have a role in uptake.
