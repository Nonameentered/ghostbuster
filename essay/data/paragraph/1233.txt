Selective attention is a cognitive process that involves the focused selection of relevant information and the ignoring of distractions. It has been widely suggested that ageing is linked to a decline in this ability, with numerous studies providing evidence for this (Salthouse, 2000). Studies of visual search also support the presence of age-related alterations in the ability to filter out irrelevant information. visual search tasks require participants to locate an object with specific properties (e.g. colour, shape) within a visual array that comprises targets and distractors. It has been found that age differences occur in the search times for such tasks, with older adults taking significantly longer than younger adults with similar abilities (see to Kramer, Hahn, Irwin & Member, 1998). This pattern is generally attributed to the difficulty older adults have in inhibiting irrelevant information, as they have less control over their attention.
