The increased incidence of Legionnaires' disease in recent years is primarily due to the increased need to store water in large quantities and the development and increased usage of aerosolizing technology for example whirlpools, showers and air conditioning systems. With inadequate cleaning and the stringent water treatment policies implemented by many countries, many pathogens are not removed from such water systems and instead find themselves in the perfect niche for colonisation and transmission.
