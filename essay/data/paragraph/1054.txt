Imperialism was often the exclusive prerogative of a small group of elites, but when the issue of national pride was at stake, and rivalry ensued, the public could often be aroused into supporting imperialist policies (clearly seen in the example of France.) Germany's aggressive 'Weltpolitik' (World policy) to secure her 'place in the sun' was an extension of the Anglo-German rivalry towards the end of the nineteenth century. Perhaps it can be suggested that, the above arguments regarding economic and cultural aspects were merely the manifestation of the broader concept of European rivalry. Linked to this concept is the theme of nationalism. The situation in Europe was balancing on a knife-edge after the unification of Italy and Germany, and the outward movement of expanding into a vast territory of unconquered plains was profitable not only as a safe outlet for the consumptive force of nationalism, but also to maintain the balance of power in Europe (Africa as the periphery of Europe).
