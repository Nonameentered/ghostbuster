In this report, researches were done on the types of engines that are usually used for racing. The four types of racing engines discussed are formula, rally, sports and motorcycle racing engines. The Report discussed and compared the four different engines and their individual performances and parameters. The report also discussed and compared the past and future development of the engines. The past developments of the Wankel Engine and Supercharging Techniques were discussed and new technologies were also mentioned such as turbocharging and cooling systems that can be added to the racing engines to increase performance. Finally, the report discussed the materials used in the engine components and how they can affect the performance of the engine. In conclusion, the report discussed the types of engines used in racing and their individual performances. It also discussed the past and future development of these engines, as well as the materials used in them that can affect performance. According to the report, the performance of the engine can be improved by using turbochargers, supercharging techniques, cooling systems and using light weight materials for the engine components.
