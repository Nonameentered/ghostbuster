Although ultimately recognising, as Clifford Geertz laments 'what we call our data are really our own constructions of other people's constructions' Indeed, there remains a vast sum of non-researched information relating to air strategy in the 1920s and 1930s waiting for the historian in the archives. Arguably, what our fighter discovery shows above all is that literature on air strategy in the 1920s and 1930s has itself become a too entrenched 'matter of faith'. It is thus the job of the air historian to revise further the subject, particularly the years 1938 to 1939, in greater detail.
