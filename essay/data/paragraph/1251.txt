objectives of the experiment. The first objective of this exercise is to understand the relationship between linear and rotational versions of Newton's second law, and how this links with the equation for the moment of inertia. The second objective is to gain experimental experience with the moments of inertia of objects. From basic motion equations, the linear and angular versions of Newton's second law shall be deduced. The form of the equation needed to calculate the disc moment of inertia shall be constructed using this knowledge. The relevant equations found for the calculatory procedures will be clearly identified and explained.
