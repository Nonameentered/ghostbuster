Natural selection is a key factor in evolution. Darwin believed that the species have the ability to change and adapt under environmental pressure. Darwin's idea that species change was in direct opposition to the biblical narrative which stated that God had created each species to be 'perfect and unchanging' In his 'On the Origin of Species' Darwin wrote that 'If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight, modifications, my theory would absolute break down' This is Darwin's way of addressing the church's beliefs directly. In his later 'Descent of Man' he concluded that there had not been ' one single determinate act of creation' Darwin's idea of evolution refuted established beliefs of the Church. It was 'not just a scientific theory but a cultural revolution along the lines of the Protestant Reformation'
