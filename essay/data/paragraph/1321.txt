The interviews themselves followed the favoured PRA technique in that they had no rigid structure. The records made from those interviews were poor because they were often unstructured, messy and sometimes incomprehensible. They are shown in appendix A. No attempt was made to collate the information recorded logically leaving the information fragmented and dislocated. This rendered much of the interview discussion worthless.
