It is true to say that the Civil War was not fought against the Whites only, but rather the struggle was with the Greens. They were the main threat to the Bolsheviks because of their sheer numbers, familiarity with the land and the political support. The Greens had spontaneous uprisings and rised in many of the cities, they managed to obtain arms and supplies and could fight the Bolsheviks for their own cause. The Reds had a lot of tactics, such as propaganda and military power, which were effective against the Whites, but did not work against the Greens. The Reds had to make concessions, introduce the NEP and there was much fighting between 1920 and 1921, especially in the countryside which had been affected by War Communism, before they were successful against the Greens. The Greens reject any Bolshevik power and wanted a democratic republic run by their own. Radkey says 'the greatest threat to the stability of the Soviet state after the defeat of the White forces came from the social revolution of the people." Therefore, the Civil War was not just Reds and Whites, but Reds and Greens and the terms in which it was fought changed dramatically.
