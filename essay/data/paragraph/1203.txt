It has been proposed that this pattern of memory deficits are a result of decreased efficiency of the medial temporal structures due to their structural deterioration (Alexopoulos, 2003). Their inefficient metabolism leads to a disruption of the thalamo-cortical loop; the resulting neural damage impedes the encoding of new memories, as well as its recall from the hippocampus (Alexopoulos, 2003). In cases of AD, this appears to be one of the main difficulties, thus it is common practise to assess one's memory when diagnosing dementia and when assessing disease progress (Morris, 1999).
