The emotions shame, guilt and embarrassment are psychological responses to specific situations where an individual perceives a sense of failure or an inability to cope. Although these words are often used interchangeably, psychologists have discussed the differences between these emotions and distinguished between them (Tangney, 1996). shame involves a stronger, more lasting sense of humiliation and worthlessness, often caused by more traumatic failures, such as lying to someone close or not meeting expectations, whereas guilt is not as distressing but still causes regret and worry and is more often used to describe a milder sense of regret about a particular incident or situation (Tangney, 1996). Embarrassment, unlikely to be caused by a serious incident, is felt in situations that require social attention or conformity, and can occur from forgetting someone's name, tripping over or speaking out of turn (Glass & McAuliffe, 1999).
