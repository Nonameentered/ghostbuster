The theory of preventative check is based upon the Malthusian idea that poor living standards were thought to be responsible for unrestrained fertility. Wrigley and Schofield's research set out to provide evidence on the links between fertility, living standards and mortality rates. The authors were keen to show the release of fertility control due to the rise in real wages during certain periods of the early modern period and the fluctuating mortality rates. The decline in fertility during times of low living standards were termed the restrictional check, whereas the rise which ensued upon reduction of mortality and the availability of food was termed the preventative check. Thus Wrigley and Schofield's research demonstrates a close correlation between real wages, fertility and mortality, concluding that the long lag theory (a fifty year gap between changes in real wages and fertility) was correct. This would suggest that the preventative check of fertility was the most important and relatively dominant factor in these population trends.
