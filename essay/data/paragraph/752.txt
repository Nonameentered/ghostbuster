The Black Death did, however, have a number of long-term effects on the social structure of Europe. In certain areas of England, for example, there were longer terms changes to the inheritance of property. Before the plague, before a son inherited from his father he was expected to acquire a share of the property of the mother's family as well. After the Black Death this matter was ignored and the rules of primogeniture- inheritance by the oldest son- were widely adopted. The concept of family changed due to the Black Death as people were less likely to marry and have large families. Surplus male population was absorbed into the army and private life became more self centered as it was no longer necessary for sons to stay at home to help with the family business. Maybe due to greater freedom, as well as the religious and economic changes of the time, there was a greater focus on individuality and personal accomplishments.
