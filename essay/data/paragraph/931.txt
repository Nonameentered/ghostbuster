The standard deviations are, with the exception of 'planful problem solving' and 'tension reduction', higher for heavy drinkers than light drinkers; however, for the most part the difference in standard deviations between the two groups is not large. Heavier drinkers thus simply appear to be slightly more variable in the extent to which they use particular coping strategies.
