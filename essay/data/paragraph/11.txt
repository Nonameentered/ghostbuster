In conclusion racism, which can be defined as an ideology which categorises people as inferior according to their race, and is put into practice through many policies and actions, which seek to exclude non-whites from many areas of society, can still be seen in today's society. There are three reasons for this. Firstly the culture of colonialism and the belief that the 'Other' is inferior is still apparent in our society today. Secondly these beliefs are reinforced through the economy, as capitalism exploits ethnic minorities, and ensures that they are viewed as less skilled, and finally racism is embedded in our political system through the policies of political parties and the links they make between non-white immigrants and social problems. All of these processes work together in contemporary society to ensure that racism still continues, and non-whites are excluded.
