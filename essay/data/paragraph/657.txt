In many ways Piaget's four stages have dramatically changed the form of education today, from school structure to curriculum. His ideas of the ability of children has influenced what is taught to children, for example division would not be taught to a five year old as Piaget says they lack the concept of reversibility, (Dricoll, 2000). In the pre-conceptual stage children cannot focus on more than one task at once, therefore a teacher will usually move children explicitly from one task to another, whereas a seven year old might be expected to listen and work at the same time. The general idea of stages can be seen used in a great many areas in life. Firstly in terminology; children are often categorised according to age, e.g. toddlers, infants, teenagers and adolescents. Secondly stages are used in commercial products including medicines, clothing and toys, where a toy might be labelled for seven to eleven year olds. Most importantly these stages are used in the schooling system, where children of the same age are taught the same material and classes are formed according to age, then grouped into infants, juniors or seniors. This system has worked well for many years and children can be seen to progress much as Piaget implied, however a fault of stage theories can be that children should be grouped according to ability not age, as some children are being taught at an inappropriate level and many are being slowed in their learning by one or two members of the class who think or behave at a lower level.
