The Green movement was made up of mainly peasants. Some Bolsheviks, particularly Trotsky, supported the Greens and wanted to improve the ill-treatment of the peasants, however, Lenin's view of the peasantry was 'the labour of the peasants was necessary and that rebellion was to be crushed." War Communism was institutionalised in July 1918, designed to crush and absorb the popular movement into the Bolshevik party. Assessing the strength of the popular movement is very difficult, as often the peasants who joined it did not state a clear aim. Kerensky argued that 'the chief front of the civil war was no longer that of the Reds against the Whites but between the Leninist-Bolsheviks and the peasantry.'
