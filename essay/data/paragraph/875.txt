Much of the Bolshevik strength lay in the land it held. The Reds held highly populated areas, including industrial Petrograd, which they could use for military equipment production and land where railways were already laid, making communication between troops easier. Conversely, the Whites were dispersed across Russia. However, the Reds relied on workers for production and railways, many of whom were members of the Greens. Therefore the Greens could pose a serious threat to the Bolsheviks if they revolted in these areas.
