The failure of the Church and the clergy to comply with the wishes of the laity led only to a 'discontent' or at least an inadequacy with the papacy; the demands of reform were more vocal in the 15 The inability (or at times, unwillingness) of the Church to fulfill this role, due largely to the lack of moral superiority of those in power, as well as the general laxity of administration, and this dissatisfaction with the functioning of the Church persisted throughout Europe through the fifteenth century. As might be expected, the reformers were not exempt from these criticisms. The fact that these criticisms were widespread could be interpreted in two ways: firstly, that the problems of the church had worsened over time and that the Pope, as a moral leader, had lost its authority; or alternatively, that the ever advancing regime of education amongst the clergy and laity has increased the expectations and sensitivity towards the ecclesiastical affairs, thus creating the impression that the Church was becoming more inadequate and irrelevant.
