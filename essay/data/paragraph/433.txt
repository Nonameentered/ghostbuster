In summary, the endosymbiotic theory was proposed by Margulis in the late 1960s This theory proposes that mitochondria, a type of bacteria, are descended from aerobic prokaryotes that were endocytosed by a primordial eukaryotic cell similar to the modern amoeba, and that the chloroplast originated from cyanobacteria The theory is supported by the presence of similar organelle structures, bacterially derived genes in the nucleus, own ribosomes, antibiotic specificity of these organelles, molecular phylogeny and double membranes in the mitochondria and chloroplasts. Furthermore, the evidence that the eukaryotic motility organelles, flagella and cilia may have arisen from endosymbiotic spirochete bacteria adds strength to the argument
