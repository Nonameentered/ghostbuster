An experiment was carried out to find out whether speech as background noise disrupts verbal processing more when it is semantically related to the task than when it is completely unrelated, as predicted by Geraci and Franklin (2004). This was done by measuring ability to learn words using short term memory whilst hearing either related words, unrelated words or no noise through headphones. Results show that noise served as a general distractor during the test phase and impaired memory significantly, however semantically related words over headphones also impaired the learning process significantly more than unrelated words. Table 1 shows that the mean score for the related condition was 1.4 words fewer than for unrelated words, whilst standard error for unrelated words was far lower than for related words. These results tell us that hearing background noise that is related to the task can interfere with the verbal processing which occurs when trying to learn a list of words. It is clear that the differences were not produced by interference during recall or storage, as no noise was experienced in the test phase, but that the speech impaired the encoding process of short term memory.
