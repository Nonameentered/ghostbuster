The more recent Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) scale (Altemeyer, 1996) claims that it has fixed the problem of acquiescence. This scale uses cognitive theory to account for authoritarianism instead of the psychodynamic approach that is used in the f-scale. The authoritarian sees the world in black and white terms, being unable or unwilling to tolerate cognitive ambiguity. In other words people with a high RWA will have a different cognitive set to those with a low RWA. It is based on the idea that authoritarianism is a personality trait consisting of three covarying components, Conventionalism, authoritarian submission and authoritarian aggression.
