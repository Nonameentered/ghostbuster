They either use fuel injection or carburetors to feed the fuel-air mixture into the combustion chamber. Motorcycles used for racing are mostly four-stroke engines with multiple cylinders. The power of an engine depends on the number and sizes of its cylinders. Therefore, increasing the sizes and number of cylinders in an engine would increase its power, i.e. increase the engine's displacement.
