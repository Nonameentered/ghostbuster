In conclusion, stem cells are a unique population of cells found in both adult and foetal tissues, which have the ability to renew themselves, to remain undifferentiated and to respond to specific signals, triggering differentiation. Pluripotent stem cells (such as those obtained from embryos) have generated much interest due to the theoretical ability to differentiate into any cell type in the body and hence act to repair tissues damaged by disease or injury. The use of stem cells in medicine looks to become more well established in the near future and therefore this review has demonstrated the potential of stem cells in tissue regenerative therapies with specific reference to diabetes, muscular dystrophy and to the tissue engineering of skin grafts. Finally, the ethical and safety issues associated with stem cells have been discussed and it is clear that in order to fully use the tremendous potential of stem cells in medicine much research needs to be undertaken to examine all the above factors in greater detail.
