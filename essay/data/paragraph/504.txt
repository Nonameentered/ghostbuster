Experiment to Determine Isoelectric Point of Casein, Haemoglobin and Cytochrome c  Introduction  The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the isoelectric points of casein, haemoglobin and cytochrome c. The isoelectric point of a molecule is the pH at which the net charge of the molecules of a substance becomes zero. The isoelectric point of a molecule will be affected by the electrostatic forces between the molecules, determined by the 'R' group side chains present on the molecule. It is this which governs its ability to bind with other molecules and form different bond configurations. This laboratory session aimed to investigate this phenomenon by identifying the isoelectric points of casein, haemoglobin and cytochrome c. Method
