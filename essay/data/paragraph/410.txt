After considering the ecological and physical restraints found within the eukaryotic cells of organelles, Lynn Margulis proposed her endosymbiotic theory in 1967. The theory states that some organelles found in the eukaryotic cells were once free-living prokaryotes that were taken up by a larger host cell, called the endosymbiont (Figure 1). The position by Margulis states that the engulfed bacteria could have formed mutualistic associations with the host cell and with each other, resulting in a complex and beneficial relationship, which is co-evolution. This theory proposed that the organelles are descendants of free-living prokaryotes, mitochondrial fission and fusion, nuclear exclusion from cytokinesis, and gene transfer and exchange between the endosymbiont and the host cell were strong indications of their descent from prokaryotes. Furthermore, studies of the endocytosed bacteriaâ€™s physiology and ecology revealed that they were anaerobic predators or "facultative aerobes", which are either anaerobic or aerobic and are capable of living with or without oxygen. These prokaryotes might have become the ancestoral form for mitochondria and chloroplasts (Figure 2). The symbionts e ukaryotes had two powerful advantages over the free-living prokaryotes : they obtained oxygen and the increased surface area provided by the larger host cell endosymbiotic theory, this being the first of a proposed evolutionary event which lead to the rise of Eukaryotic cells.
