The meeting of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in Paris in the summer of 1844 marked the beginning of an enduring friendship and cooperation between two leading political and social thinkers. Marx and his family had come to Paris from Germany after their home country had closed its borders to revolutionary activity. Like Marx, Engels was looking for ways to make a social and political revolution. Soon the two formed a friendship and a mutual admiration and respect for each other's writings and beliefs.
