Method The study used qualitative methods with semi-structured questionnaires. Participants (10 undergraduate students) were asked to give three examples for each emotion, of when they would experience them. Further background information was requested such as gender, age and course of study. The questions were open-ended and few constraints were placed upon this, allowing participants to answer freely in their own words.  Results and Discussion
