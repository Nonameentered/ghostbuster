Since this paper is interactive in type, and wishes to contrast old and new source material, we will start by examining post-war air strategy during the tenure of the Chief of the Air Staff, Lord Trenchard. The economic backlash to the war had radically curtailed the Royal Flying Corps' ambition to become a fully stream-lined competitive fighting force. We therefore wished to examine service expenditure since the Great War to gain an appreciation of the financial impediments that Trenchard encountered. This data was taken from a 1921 Air Ministry Memorandum (Appendix 1, reproduced in Figure 3 below).
