These ideas are supported by Reiser (1963) who reported that hypnosis increased the amount of wrong information recalled. As hypnotic suggestibility involves post event information acceptance (Kirsch &Lynn, 1995), even information verbally implanted during the interview could produce false memories. Indeed, hypnotic post-event information has been found to increase false memories more than nonhypnotic post-event information (Sherman, et al., 1997). Within police interviews the closest analogy to hypnosis is extreme and lengthy concentration, and so if this is combined with leading questions and misinformation, false memories can occur. Indeed, regression techniques, in which the interviewer begins by asking questions about the event before the actual crime, have particularly been found to accompany false memories (Pezdek & Wodarski, 1993). Also, a hypnotic state can be created by requiring the witness to stress the importance of detail (Loftus, 1997) and also by leading questions such as "I want you to try to remember". Consequently, it appears likely that these type of interviewing techniques would have meant Mayes was convicted even without hypnosis.
