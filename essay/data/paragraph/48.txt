Patriarchal ideology prescribes particular behaviour for marriage and reproduction; the idea that marriage is based upon heterosexual relationships and that having children is the next natural step (Gittins, 1993), meaning that many women see getting married and having children as a natural progression through life, even in modern society. This is reinforced by strong historical discourses that link femininity with motherhood, claiming that 'true womanhood' is not reached unless women have children, or see having children as their biological and ideological goals (McDaniel, 1996). Culture dictates that it is natural for women to be mothers, and prescribes the number of children that is seen as respectable within our society (Schneider and Schneider, 1995, cited in Schoen et al, 1997, p335). Religious, political and scientific leaders stress that it is only through motherhood that women can be fulfilled, and Gillespie supports this, highlighting the way in which motherhood is seen as natural in modern society; 'the idea that motherhood is essentialist, deterministic, fixed, inevitably fulfilling and central to feminine identity is firmly entrenched in industrial, urban and rural societies' (2001, p141).
