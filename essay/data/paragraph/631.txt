In conclusion, despite the problems with Wrigley and Schofield's methodology and evidence the population trends they map out are plausible and the best figures historians have to work with. I have suggested however that in many ways their interpretation of the causality of this trend is flawed. The judgement that living standards and wage rates determined nuptiality and therefore fertility, or that 'marriage is the hinge upon which the demographic regime turned' is inaccurate. Family reconstitution provided data on fertility which was unreliable and unrepresentative. However, even accepting these methodological limitations the figures then seemed to be moulded to fit a Malthusian framework of preventative check homeostasis. The 'long lag' theory used to justify the lack of direct correlation between fertility and real wages over simplifies a very complex phenomenon whilst simultaneously relegating other important factors to mere conditions or circumstances rather than causes of population change. The fact that we do not know enough about marriage patterns, non-church marriages, or the parental influences over children of every day people makes the long lag an unsustainable claim.
