Another point of criticism that has been brought to the fore, is the way in which sociology, in Simmel's conception, occupies a place merely as the study of the microsocial, which comes out of the distinction between and form and content as the only purely human element in social relations (Abel 1959: 476). It is, furthermore, a point of inconsistency between Simmel's writing on what sociological studies should consist of, and his actual sociological treatises. For example, when Simmel describes the social form "secrecy" as 'a formal means of boasting and of subordinating the others' (Simmel 1950: 332), this definition is much narrower than his further expansion on its role in associations, and the physical-spatial element that secrecy often involves. Hence, it can be said that the Simmel's descriptions of the content often go beyond what he himself characterised as the elements that make up a society. By focussing on the microsocial element of society, Simmel failed to appropriate the external force of society over the individual, arguing, contrarily to Durkheim, that 'with every growth of new synthesising phenomena [...], the same group becomes "more society" than it was before' (Simmel 1971a: 27); that is - society is the sum-total of all microsocial interaction.
