There has also been great success in the production of autotomous transgenic autographs derived from pluripotent stem cells. Such cells have the potential to differentiate challenges as those derived from animal models can easily be rejected when transplanted into humans due to the presence of animal specific antigens (15).  In conclusion, stem cells offer a great potential for treating diseases such as diabetes and muscular dystrophy. However, there are still many challenges that need to be overcome before pluripotent embryonic or adult stem cells can feasibly be used in clinical practices including the ethical issues surrounding the production and transplant of embryo-derived stem cells, the safety of such cells and the complexity of directed cell differentiation.
