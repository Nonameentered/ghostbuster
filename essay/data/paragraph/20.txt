The fact that the statistics can be the state's tool also means that problems with reliability and validity can arise as those with power are likely to choose a method that produces the most favourable outcomes (May, 1997). Informants may also be less likely to provide accurate information if they believed that the state was using it, something which could cause problems as statistics depend heavily on accurate responses (May, 1997). This view of official statistics paints a very different picture to that of the posivitists as instead of just having problems with reliability and validity, the methodology and decision making processing involved in the production of the statistics actually make us question the veracity of the results, rather than just the process.
