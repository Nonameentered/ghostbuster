A survey was carried out to investigate the causes and occurrences of the emotions shame, guilt and embarrassment. Ten participants were asked to cite three examples of occasions when they would feel these emotions. Responses were then looked at for general trends and categorised as to the type of situation or response given. It was generally noted that embarrassment was a more public emotion than shame or guilt, and that shame and guilt were brought about by similar situations. These results are discussed in terms of the meanings of these three emotions and the nature of social consciousness.
