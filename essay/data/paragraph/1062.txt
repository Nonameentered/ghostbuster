Amongst the other factors that contributed to the outbreak of the revolution, Hobsbawm He explains that the bankruptcy of the government and the resultant need for tax reforms gave the aristocracy and the parlements a chance to barter with the government. In exchange for the tax reforms, the aristocracy wanted an extension of their privileges, and this led to the forming of the assembly of notables and the calling of the Estates-General (a feudal assembly which last met in 1614). Hobsbawm concluded that the revolution thus began as an aristocratic attempt to recapture the state, but it underestimated the sovereign ideas of the 'Third Estate', and the socio-economic consequences of its political demands. What made the 'Third Estate' a force to be reckoned with was the fact that they not only represented the interests of the middle classes, but also of the urban poor and eventually, the revolutionary peasantry. In my opinion, the socio-economic context of revolutionary France was just as, if not more important than the influence of the Enlightenment. The fact that the revolution broke out in 1789 and not any other year was partly because of the bad harvest in 1788/9, which was reinforced by a particularly harsh winter. The severe economic consequences and the resulting industrial depression drove the urban and rural poor to desperation. The impact was heightened by the fact that in the preceding years, conditions were improving and things were turning out for the better. The expectations of the people were raised, and it came crashing down in 1789. Hobsbawm also suggested that the campaign of propaganda lent an added political dimension to the grievances of the people, and united them behind the deputies of the 'Third Estate'. Once the bastion of monarchical suppression and power (the Bastille) had fallen, there was no turning back.
