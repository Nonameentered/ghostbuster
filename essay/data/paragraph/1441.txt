From a component-by component point of view, the item that will need upgrading/replacing sooner than the rest will be the turbine and generator. There is already significant leakage from the seal joining the two halves of the turbine, and any repair is compromised by the substantial corrosion of the studding and bolts. The state of the turbine blades inside will be compromised by debris flowing down the pipe. While this has been addressed at the damn end, the snifter valve has been left open for debris to fall into it. The MDPE pipe should last out for 50 years, should it not suffer any significant damage, which is unlikely given that logging in that area was only recent.
