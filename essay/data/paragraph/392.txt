In plate 6, the recipient quadrant of the plate showed growth even though both the donor and the recipient (the parental strains) were counter selected. This is due to reversions, which is a form of point mutation that is capable of being reversed so that the original sequence is restored and thus, is resistant to nalidixic acid and can grow without threonine. However, reversions can only take place for certain classes of mutations thus, several different types of mutant alleles are required to test for a reversion.
