Alzheimer's disease is a form of degenerative dementia, first described by Alois Alzheimer in 1907. Roughly 5.3 million people in America alone suffer from AD which is expected to triple over the next 50 years (Schneider et al., 2001). According to the World Health Organisation (2001), AD is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for over 50% of all cases, hence it is particularly important to understand the psychological effects of dementia in order to help sustain and improve the quality of life of not only the patient but also of the primary carer.
