A secondary concern is that viewed aggression will cause violent behaviour, in line with the work of Bandura (1973). Research has tended to focus on the general effects of viewed aggression on real life aggression (Wood, Wong and Chancere, 1991), establishing general links between media violence and increased aggression in the child's unconstrained social behaviour. However, other research uncovers the influence of individual differences such as gender, socio-economic status and personality traits on how young children perceive aggression on television and in the media, and how they subsequently act. This research helps to dispel the vague claim that all children's lives are always influenced by televised aggression - this is not always the case (Carruthers and Taggart, 1973; Drabman and Thomas, 1994; Jenkins, 1999). It examines what can specifically make viewed aggression demonstrate itself in behaviour. For example, research has been conducted on the relationship between trait aggression and viewing aggression on television and in films. Bushman and Geen (1990), studied 50 children aged seven to fifteen years-old. They were given personality questionnaires, and viewed a series of violent film excerpts on which they were asked to comment. Children rated high on measures of irritability, proneness to verbal hostility, and in screening or blocking out aggressive stimuli made more violent comments than children who were rated low on these items. In addition, children consequently behaved in a more aggressive manner. This demonstrates that whether or not violent images produce violent tendencies can be contingent on the traits of the individual child.
