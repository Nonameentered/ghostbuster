Behaviourism operates on the idea of cause and effect - stimulus in leads to behaviour out, and is seen as one particular school of psychology. It is not concerned with the internal thought processes or mental states of an individual but instead looks at their observable behaviour. Skinner believed that people's actions were entirely governed by their environment and said that psychological problems were the result of incorrect learning, caused by environmental contingencies, and so are solvable on a behavioural level. This has encouraged therapies to be developed which attempt to alter forms of behaviour in order to solve a problem.
