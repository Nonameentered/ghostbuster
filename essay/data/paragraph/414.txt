Chloroplasts (Figure 5) are green coloured, photosynthetic organelle found in plant and algae cells They are double-membrane bound organelle, similarly to mitochondria and they are larger and have different shapes from each other Chloroplasts also lack sterols and are usually large in size (1–5µm) They house their own DNA and their own ribosomes, similarly to mitochondria and hydrogenosomes The chloroplasts contain thylakoid membrane system, which is involved in the primary photochemical processes of plant cells, in the biochemical conversion of light energy into chemical energy via photosynthesis
