Firstly, it is important to understand that madness, in all its various forms, was seen as a female illness. Femininity became inextricably linked with hysteria, along with neurasthenia and anorexia nervosa. The main reasoning for this is to be found in the prevailing misogynistic understanding of female sexuality in nineteenth century England. Women were viewed as emotionally unstable as a result of the functions of their reproductive organs, the precise workings of which received limited medical investigation. The popular theory put forward by physicians claimed that madness was caused by 'the action of the reproductive organs on an unstable nervous system', This was a reductionist view of madness, using biology to ascertain causes of the illness rather than analysing social and cultural factors relevant to the women affected. In this view, female biological functions were seen as the cause of madness, namely the onset of menstruation, pregnancy, childbirth and the menopause. From this it can be seen how madness was viewed in a feminine context, confining women to the subject of psychoanalysis throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The primary origins of women's madness were considered a result of their diseased sex organs, insatiable sexual desire, sedentary lifestyles and inferior minds.
