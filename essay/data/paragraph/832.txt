In conclusion Psychology is the study of the phenomena of behaviour and mental processes. An advantage of using qualitative methods is that we can study behaviour in the context of which it occurs which leads to a greater understanding to the meaning behind the behaviour (Billig, 1997). Providing measures are taken to ensure the quality and trustworthiness of the analysis of data collected, the qualitative method of studying psychology is highly valid and reliable when defined in relation to its own methodology.
