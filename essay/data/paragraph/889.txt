During the war the Soviet Union needed large numbers to fight and work in industry. The government forced men to join the war effort and drafted young men into the army. This had less of an effect on the country as a whole than expected as only 8 million out of a population of 170 million were in the army. The government severely punished those who did not defend Russia. For example, 'For everyone captured deserting or returning home without permission (the punishment) was shooting." This severe punishment was to ensure that Russian soldiers would fight harder in order to avoid execution. The civil population could also be punished for not defending the nation; some 200,000 people were arrested for 'defeatist activity." Even though the thirst for new recruits was desperate, there is still some respect to be given to the Russian people's effort as many individuals wanted to join the war effort voluntarily. Men volunteered so that their families could move to the rear and enjoy better accommodation; many actively sought to join the war effort. It is clear that the people had a strong desire for victory, for the most part people were glad to serve on the frontline; many saw it as a patriotic duty. This provides an indication as to why the defeated the Germans.
