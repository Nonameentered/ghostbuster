'Economically, Florence was in the position to lead the way, for it was the wealthiest of the Italian cities' It was a banking centre with the rich merchants being able to finance major works of art and commission buildings that were unaffordable to other cities. The wealthy citizens also offered their patronage to artists. Wealth was of major importance in the city. The wealth of Florence had its roots in the trading of spices, cloths and metals and also in its banking business. Florence was the pre-eminent banking centre in Europe and boasted such wealthy clients as Pope Urban VIII, the King of France and the Emperor Charles V. Within Italy, Florence successfully managed to acquire two of the most powerful and influential families as their patrons, the Albizzi and the Medici. The Albizzi family, who had been creditors to the Popes, had a good relationship with Urban VIII, who borrowed money from them to pay for the expensive renovations to St Peter's in Rome. The Medici, on the other hand, controlled the vast wealth of the papacy after their acquisition of tax farming rights from the papacy. Lorenzo de'Medici was 'immensely wealthy' Cronin has commented that 'it was the bankers and merchants such as the Albizzi and Medici, who conducted the gastly business of usury and taxes, but were able to utilize their wealth for the benefit of artistic patronage'
