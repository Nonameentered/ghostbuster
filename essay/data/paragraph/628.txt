In their study of Mid-Wharfedale parishes in 1623 Moira Long and May Pickles also found that evidence of 'crisis mortality' was often a part of early modern life, if not in the form of full blown famine certainly in the form of 'crisis months'. Victor Skipp found considerable regional variation in occurrences of famine and shortages which might conceivably have led to their relative invisibility in the small sample of Wrigley and Schofield.
