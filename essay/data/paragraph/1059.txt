The philosophes (Rousseau, Voltaire, Montesquieu, d'Holbach, etc) provided a language and an ideology of political criticism that was so sorely lacked before the Enlightenment-one that questioned Christianity, statecraft and aimed to foster arouse critical spirit among the people. Rousseau's Discourse on Political Economy (1755) was one of the most radical works, and it proposed a social contract between individuals and their government, in which a special 'general ' will replaced the power of the monarch. He also asserts the idea of the sovereignty of the people - a doctrine that would become a central feature of the French Revolution. Rousseau's Social Contract (1762) was another striking work, in which he concluded that 'the people's will is always right . Thanks to Voltaire, rationalism and critical spirit gained currency, even though some critics (e.g. Roger Chartier) regard Voltaire and the philosophes primarily as erudite litt√©rateurs rather than committed philosophers. Other works such as d'Holbach's 'Dictionary of Atheism and System of Nature (1770) and the celebrated Encyclopedie (1751-1772) furthered the cause of the philosophes, imparting a vocabulary of criticism and a thought-context to the people and thus facilitating their participation in public debate.
