The diagram above shows a generalised structure of an amino acid. Most amino acids consist of an amino group (-NH2) and a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) joined together by a carbon atom known as the alpha carbon. Both these groups are attached to a unique side group which determines the particular properties of the amino acid. The properties of an amino acid depend on the side group, and can range from nonpolar to polar, acidic to basic and hydrophobic to hydrophilic. The varying properties will also depend on the pH of the environment, with the side group gaining or losing charges depending on the pH. The overall charge of the amino acid and therefore whether it is an ion at any particular pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (pKw=14.7).
