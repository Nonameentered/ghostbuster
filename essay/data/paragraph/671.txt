Method  Ten participants took part in the survey. Their age ranged from 18 to 26 years old, and both genders were present. All the participants were asked to cite three examples of occasions when they would feel shame, guilt or embarrassment. They were asked to specify events and situations rather than vague generalisations. Their responses were then divided up into categories to compare the three emotions against each other. These categories were: active events (events the participant had chosen to do) versus passive events (events out of the participants control), one-on-one/private or group/public situations, and those involving a personal relationship, versus those involving strangers or public. Answers were also looked at to assess how detailed they were; whether they described an actual event, or just a general situation. There was no control group in the study.
