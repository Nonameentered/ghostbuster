As well as expanding eastwards, Europe also gained an extremely valuable advantage above Asia through Columbus' discovery of the Americas in 1492. Acquisition of the New World supplied the West with new food products, a territorial outlet for an expanding population, and resources such as coal. In terms of food, the Americas provided protein-rich fish from the Caribbean and alternative staples to wheat such as maize and potatoes. The Spanish introduced cattle to Latin America, which meant that Europe was able to import beef as well. Asia did adopt maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes and peanuts from the New World into their diet, which increased the land under cultivation by thirty five percent between 1660 and 1760, as these new products could be grown in drier conditions than rice. However, these lands were a lower yield than the paddy fields, and deforestation to plant the new crops caused soil erosion and flooding into the low lying, fertile areas. As Bayly concludes, the New World was of most benefit to the west because it provided 'new, nutritious varieties of food...(which) spread across the Old World in the wake of the Spanish and Portuguese "discoveries", improving fertility and resistance to disease' Better diet enabled a stronger workforce, conducive to increasing production.
