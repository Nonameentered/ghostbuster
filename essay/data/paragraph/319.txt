Karl Marx's name is synonymous with the concept of class. He states that men were always constituted by the antagonistic class relations into whom they are cast 'and the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles' This assertion was seen to not only have a capacity to unmask the structure of capitalist power, particularly in its inequitable and exploitative guises, but also to change the political terrain irrevocably. However, it is significant to note that he gives class no precise definition. Using his work, later Marxists developed what they saw as a duality to class. In an 'objective' sense, they spoke of a class 'in itself', which was no more than a form of collective identity. This grouped people together by their shared economic characteristics, principally in their relationship to the means of production. In a 'subjective' sense, there was a class 'for itself', which describes the process by which these aggregates become politically and consciously transformed, aware of themselves as a class. Others later took up the torch. Led by E P Thompson, the British Marxist historians present a history of class 'from the bottom up'. Thompson attacked the tendency of historians to see class as merely a structure or category and in doing so 'obscure the agency of the working people' He began to recognise the prima facie relevance to other emerging social identities, such as feminism, thereby relinquishing Marx's economic 'determination in the last instance'. Despite this, to the Marxist, class remains primarily the anvil on which history was formed.
