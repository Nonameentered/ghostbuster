British men's fascination with 'other' cultures was partially driven by the racist idea that Imperialism was justified by the Englishmen's right to rule over people deemed too uncivilised or immoral to govern themselves. There is an apparent contradiction in the Victorian fascination with the 'primitive'; whilst it was looked upon as something to be feared for its uncontrollable nature, at the same time it was viewed as an opportunity to transgress the rigid boundaries of their own society, to the point where the Englishmen could regress to a 'baser' state (Jaeggi, 2018; 116). This apparent paradox was exemplified in the works of Kipling, wherein he repeatedly portrays the Englishman as the austere and civilised other amidst the backdrop of wilder, 'native' people and landscapes (117).
