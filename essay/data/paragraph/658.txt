Stage models of development have been criticised over the last three decades for several reasons; biological models of development have been developed to explain the complexity of the brain, and account for biochemical and genetic changes as well as the physical maturation of the structure of the brain itself. Secondly, transition between stages can be much slower than assumed, or even occur in reverse sometimes, as not all children develop at the same rate so a gradual continuum in development may be more accurate. Thirdly, many stage theories concentrate on age as a marker for development, rather than an understanding of the actual learning process, (Kilpatrick, 1992). Fourthly, fluctuations in performance within one age group and different levels of attainment in each child within one age group suggest that stages may be too restrictive and that a continuous form of development may be more accurate. Finally, stage theorists are criticised for ignoring other influences such as gender, social background or regional influences, which have also been suggested to play a part in development. All of this has led to a decline in acceptance of stage theories in recent years in favour of connectionist or information processing theories, such as those of the Cognitive Science Network, (Kilpatrick, 1992).
