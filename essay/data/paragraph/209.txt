Another point of view insists on the juxtaposition of democracy and liberalism, positioning Rousseau in a radically democratic framework. Liberalism can be taken at an individual level, stressing the removal of any constraint on human action (negative liberty), and placing theory in wider context, that of the body politic (positive liberty). 'Man is born free; and everywhere he is in chains', he argues, 'One thinks himself the master of others, and still remains a greater slave than they'. Here we find the distinction that Rousseau makes between a narrow form of personal interest and a wider, more coherent form of enlightened interest, being the best for the community, and thus, indirectly, each citizen's actual will, as it secures the best-considered proposal and enjoys general support of the citizenry. Subordination to the law subsequently only becomes an exercise of one's liberty.
