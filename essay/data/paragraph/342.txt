Simply this demonstrates a strategic move from parity bombers to strategic bombers. The source supports what we know, that policy-makers attempted to increase bomber strength and impose deterring parity with Germany, so 'by 1938 Bomber Command had achieved strategic balance with the Luftwaffe'. The continued emphasis of bombers runs in tandem with existing historiographical understanding, which postulates that this period saw the growing belief that bombers could achieve political objectives largely through the production of fear and intimidation, leading to 'blitz diplomacy', or the deliberate targeting of civilian populations and armament factories. It also obliquely suggests that policymakers neither had faith in the capability of fighters to turn the tide of future wars, nor the economic capacity to mass produce them in any great volume.
