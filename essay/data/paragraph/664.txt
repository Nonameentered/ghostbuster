Behaviour modification and other training therapies have been much criticised for appearing patronising and for essentially denying any form of free will. It has been pointed out that many of the techniques used have been successful only in a controlled environment and are not indications of real-life behaviour. Of course, no real life situations have a limit to their duration or provide the rewards that the patient needs. There is a need for real life application of learned skills and for the patient to want to effect a real change in themselves. Without this belief any changes learnt through behaviouristic therapy will be only temporary.
