Furthermore, criticisms of clerical poverty and ignorance still plague the church. The shallow education of the clergy was, however, instigated by the Church itself, with the fragmentation of educational Institutions into separate faculties for Theology and Law, in the twelfth century. It is also pertinent to note that there was a degree of continuity with regards to the type of persons enrolled in the Church. Swanson rightly points out that "the pattern of recruitment among the higher clergy was not all that different on the the eve of the Reformation than it had been at any other time." Improvements in the level of education of the Clergy was most notably seen in the 'Reform Popes' (famous for commissions for the reform of taxation and Church appointments) who sought to remedy the situation. Moreover, the papal decrees listing the qualifications needed by candidates to be appointed to benefices, and the implementation of 'visitation rights' (for bishops to examine church discipline) also pointed to a concerted effort of church reform on the eve of the Reformation.
