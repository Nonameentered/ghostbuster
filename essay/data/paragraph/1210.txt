From the evidence presented above, it appears that many of the cognitive effects of dementia have profound psychological effects on the patient, which in turn can directly or indirectly affect the caregiver. Two of the most common features of dementia include disorientation and disturbances in behaviour (Morris et al, 1988), both of which have significant implications for the lives of the patient and the caregiver. Disorientation and confusion, induce uncertainty in the patient's ability to make sense of the world around them, resulting in fear, paranoia and agitated behaviour. An inability to reorient and correctly interpret the environment implies a lack of judgement, thus endangering the patient, for example instability and the risk of falling. This confusion and disorientation is extremely distressing and frustrating, both for the patient and the caregiver. It could also lead to behavioural changes in the patient such as irritability, aggression and restlessness (Morris et al, 1988). These behaviours could be the cause of the increased levels in violence, suicide and other health relatd problems reported in caregiver's of dementia patients (Morrissey et al, 1990). Medication is often the most effective form of treatment for these behaviours but such treatments can often have an apathetic effect (Stokes and Holden, 1990), which may also be psychologically detrimental to the patient.
