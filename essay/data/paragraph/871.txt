Overall both approaches to understanding jury deliberation processes, the story board model and the social decision schemes, have produced much evidence that can help us understand the jury. Pennington and Hastie's (1992) research demonstrates that stories are being created to help a juror generate a verdict, and other research (Huntley and Costanzo, 2003) demonstrates that individual schemas and assumptions can divert a story into different directions. It can be assumed that these stories are then entered as part of the deliberation process when the jury is trying to reach a unanimous verdict. The social decision scheme model conversely, provides an effective predictive tool to assess the probability of a particular verdict, given the initial preferences of the jurors. To make this an accurate predictive tool however it is necessary to take into consideration all the facts of the case, as any slight change may alter its accuracy (Parks and Kerr, 1999). Lastly it is important to note that neither of these two theories alone is sufficient for demonstrating the jury deliberation process and that it may be much more complex than this. It may also be the case that the jury deliberation process is not the same for all case types, and that social decision schemes must take into consideration many other circumstantial factors.
