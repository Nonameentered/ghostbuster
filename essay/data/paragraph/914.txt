Blackmore provides a number of such examples of behaviours that are mimetically adaptive but biologically unadaptive (Cook, 1995); for example, she claims the rise in the use of birth control, whilst not genetically advantageous, means women who have fewer children will have more time to spread their own memes, including memes for birth control and the pleasures of a small family. These are the women whose success inspires others, and who provide role models for other women to copy. Furthermore, whilst adoption may be viewed as a mistake from the gene's point of view, for memes the benefits of adoption are obvious. As far as memes are concerned, the time and effort expended on an adopted child are as valuable as that expended on one's own offspring. All that matters is that you can pass on your memes to people who will be influenced by you and subsequently imitate your behaviours and beliefs. Genetic relation is of no importance. In both of these examples there is a battle between memes and genes to take control over the machinery of replication (Blackmore, 1999).
