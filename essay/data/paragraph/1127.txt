Oligodendroglia cells are held in the sheath of Schwann, which covers myelin and provides insulation to the neurons in the central nervous system. The axon of each neuron is protected by a myelin sheath, this ensures the transmission of signals and allows nerve impulses to be propagated to the next neuron. This mylelination has a strong impact on behaviours as it profoundly increases the velocity of nerve impulses and thereby affects the temporal order of events in the nervous system (Biological Psychology, 2002, p. 69). Normal transmissions are so fast and automatic that it is hard to accept a delay between a thought and a muscle contraction. The speed of nerve conduction due to the presence of the oligodendroglia cells is up to approximately 260 miles per hour (Psychology 5 The myelin sheath around the axon is made up from 2 principle proteins, the myelin basic protein and the proteolipid protein.
