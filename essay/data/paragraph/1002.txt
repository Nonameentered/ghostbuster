2. Supercharger - A device to force air into the engine's cylinder, operated with the turbine in the exhaust manifold. By doing so, more air than normal could be supplied into the cylinders, hence more fuel could also added to the cylinder. This leads to the more force being applied to the pistons and eventually boost the power of engines (Figure 8).
