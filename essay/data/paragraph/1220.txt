However, although it is suggested that recall increases under hypnosis, accuracy does not (Dinges et al., 1992), as suggestibility to leading questions and post event information has also been found to increase (Dywan & Bowers, 1983). State theorists would claim that as the witness in the case was placed in a dissociative state when recalling the perpetrator, her cognitive processes and hence, reality monitoring (i.e. distinguishing between memories of real and imagined events) would decrease, and so she would have been unable to source monitor any suggestions placed in her mind. However, non state theorists would argue that the detcective's authority increased the witness's acceptance to suggestions, as research has shown misinformation acceptance to increase with the perceived authority of the source of that misinformation (Toglia, et al., 1992). Also, when badgered by an official interviewer, witnesses become rattled and tend to change their memory recall (Wright, 1995, as cited in Wright & Loftus, 1998). It was also alleged that the detective particularly wished for Mayes to be convicted in order to provide information on an unrelated homicide. Therefore, during hypnosis the detective may have implanted the false identity, or at the very least, utilised leading questions.
