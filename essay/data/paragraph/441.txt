Here conjugation will be investigated in In This experiment involves conjugation between an Hfr (high frequency recombination - the F factor is integrated into the chromosome) strain, the donor, and a F- strain, the recipient. The E. coli chromosome is circular and transfer always starts from the same point, the F factor integration site, which allows time of entry mapping to be carried out: As soon as the two strains are mixed mating aggregates will form and transfer of the chromosome will start from a fixed site and in a fixed orientation. If the mating pairs are physically interrupted at intervals, mapping the time of entry of genes from the donor into the recipient can create a genetic map of the chromosome.
