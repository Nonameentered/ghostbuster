Although a hydro-scheme is installed at the site, the stream that is used by Nick Mills has not had flow rate measurements taken on it. Therefore one must develop an idea of the flow characteristics of the stream by looking at characteristics of a nearby river, i.e. the Ystwyth. Using the same exceedance data from here (Figure 1), one can scale it down by the difference in rainfall between the two rivers' catchment areas, and the different catchment area sizes (Appendix 1). This produces the data shown in Graph 1, which shows the exceeded flow rate for a given percentage time of the year.
