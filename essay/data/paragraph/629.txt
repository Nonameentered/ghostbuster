Throughout this essay so far, I have tried to emphasise the continuous links between mortality and fertility during the early modern period; it is this essential inter-linkage which I wish to look at more explicitly now. There were interconnections between disease, migration, death, birth rate, price and wage, amongst others; in practice of course the nature of and the strengths of these links varied, nevertheless they did exist. The incidence of famine whether long or short term affected disease rates, fertility rates and migration rates as well as affecting prices and wages as the population lessens. Likewise, high fertility could force prices up, wages down, encourage migration and make disease more probable. It seems to me that the circular nature and knock on effect of all these factors combining to shape each other and the population would be better described in terms of a set of dominoes rather than as a hinge which suggests not only the Does not the very reality of high fertility demand low levels of disease and plenty of food? And does not the very reality of famine demand high levels of population? As Laslett suggests 'each part of our subject is also our whole subject...the fund of food was obviously related to age at marriage and numbers marrying.'
