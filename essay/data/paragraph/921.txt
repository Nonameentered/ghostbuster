Broadly speaking, coping is traditionally divided into two categories; problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping. Problem-focused coping is defined in terms of managing specific external demands or internal sensations, with one's efforts being focused primarily on problem-solving processes. Emotion-focused coping, on the other hand, is seen as involving regulating the emotional responses to a stressful situation so as to minimise distress. This may include strategies such as avoiding, denying, distancing, blaming or accepting blame, as well as using cognitive and behavioural strategies to manipulate subjective and objective appraisals of the situation (Folkman & Lazarus, 1986; Finkenauer & Engels, 2002). In general, problem-focused coping is regarded as a healthier style of responding to stress than emotion-focused coping. Those who employ emotion-focused coping are typically viewed as engaging in maladaptive behaviour and avoidant patterns of reacting (Folkman, Lazarus, Gruen & DeLongis, 1986). It is widely assumed that heavy reliance on avoidance coping leads to poorer adjustment, greater vulnerability to stress, and poorer physical and mental well-being (Moos & Schaefer, 1981; Pearlin & Schooler, 1978; Wills, 1979).
