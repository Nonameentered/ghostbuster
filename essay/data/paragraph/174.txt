The strength of Simmel's works lies in his concept of forms-of-sociation, which may be used to examine sociological phenomena from a distanced yet deep angle. These forms can then be seen as the inevitably interactive element of deliberately exercised and unintentional forms-of-sociation between two or more social actors that work in tandem on the social level. Simmel further claims that the primary focus of this 'grammatical' approach to society should be placed upon 'the psychological element in the relation in so far as it has a necessary function in the formation of social forms' (Simmel 1971a: 34). This allows for a democratic, interactive, and primarily humanising approach to the study of society as a collection of individuals, which transcends the traditional Durkheimian approach of a static social system and its 'primary and secondary forces' (Durkheim 1955).
