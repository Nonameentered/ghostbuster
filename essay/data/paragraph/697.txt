Possible problems in the design of the study could account for odd results, although no firm conclusions can be made. Although the within subjects design removes between subjects variance, here the within subjects design may have affected the recorded response times. Practice of the opposite worlds test will clearly increase ability, so that even with counter balancing, the more practised second condition may lead to outliers in some cases. Other problems include the type of distraction - in this case a children's cartoon. It might be that cartoons appeal more to boys than girls, leading to greater distraction, and that another sort of distraction, such as a friend entering the room or a conversation starting, may distract girls more. The choice may also be criticised for its irrelevance to the road-crossing scenario, where a friendly conversation might be more appropriate. It should be noted, however, that the test of everyday attention, which was used as the stimulus, has been investigated by psychology professionals and is thought to be both reliable and valid, with high test-retest reliability and significant correlation with other measures of attention, suggesting that results can be generalised to various measures of attention performance (Robertson, Ward, Ridgeway & Nimmo-Smith, 1996).
