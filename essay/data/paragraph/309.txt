Bhaskar argued that whilst laboratory experiments may produce observable regularities (or 'constant conjunctions'), these regularities cannot be taken to be causal laws (Bhaskar, 1975; 16). Bhaskar's justification for this assertion was his differentiation between 'open and closed systems'. 'Closed systems' are not naturally occurring in nature and require human intervention to exist (such as laboratory experiments); in a 'closed system' any intervening causes which may prevent a causal mechanism from having its normal effect are excluded (Bhaskar, 1986; 27). Bhaskar showed that the extrapolation of causal laws from observable regularities is predicated upon viewing reality as a 'closed system'. In contrast to this Bhaskar advanced the view that reality is an 'open system' in which causal mechanisms (like gravity) interact with other causal mechanisms and can interrupt their causal effects, therefore the manifestation of effects at the empirical level is contingent upon the interaction between unobservable entities.
