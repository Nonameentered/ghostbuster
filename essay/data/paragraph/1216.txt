It was alleged that the prosecutors had severely disrupted the children's memories through extended interviews (e.g. 4 hour pre-trial interviews). This could be due to the fact that a child's memory is far less consolidated and due to the interviewer's bias, in which the verbal/nonverbal cues they give could serve as powerful postevent misinformation (Lewis, al., 1995). Also the children were continually shown a video of the teacher so that the children would take action if necessary, instead of merely saying what happened. Therefore, it appears that the children's memories were, not only distorted through suggestive questioning, but also through verbal/nonverbal cues, and post-event information.
