plates 2 (lacking histidine) and 5 (lacking proline) both showed growth for the first time at the samples plated at 60 and 120 minutes respectively. Due to the differences in growth levels between these plates at times later than 60 minutes it can be speculated that the proline gene would have transfered first probably within the first 60 minutes and the histidine gene nearer to the end of this period (120 minutes).
