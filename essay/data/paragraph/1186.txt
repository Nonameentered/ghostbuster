The presence of early imitation could also be taken as evidence of an innate predisposition to communicate; it has also been seen as a way of learning new behaviours (Piaget, 1962). Meltzoff & Moore (2002) concluded that imitation was simply a 'primitive means of understanding and communicating with other people'. This suggests that even from birth we are aware of other peoples' minds, which we can then use to aid our knowledge of the world. Therefore, even prior to language development, newborns have already established a direct link with other people.
