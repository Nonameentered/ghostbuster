The discrepancy between East and West led to a state attitude of control towards essential resources, namely water. Water was arguably the most important resource in developing agricultural production, and East Asia had to cope with regular flooding and consequently regulation of their rivers via construction of dykes was necessary. In China, the disastrous floods of 1612 led to the resignation of the Grand Eunuch Gu Magi; this event signified the start of a more methodical approach to control. By 1667 the Chinese ministry of works had taken control of maintaining rivers with the 'Great Canal' being completed ten years later. Even then, completion of the Great Canal was not solely for the custom of trade: its object was to provide a means for transporting troops quickly between the East and West of the country.
