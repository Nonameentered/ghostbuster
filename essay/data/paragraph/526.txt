The first phase (the lag phase) occurred in the first thirty minutes of the investigation. This was the time period when the cells in the culture were getting ready to enter the active growth phase and therefore had to synthesis all the enzymes needed for transport and metabolism of the available nutrients, and for the production of new cell products. Although the data we collected showed this phase to be quite inactive, if we had collected data for protein concentration for example, this phase would have shown quite the opposite result. The second phase shown in our results is the acceleration phase (phase two on the graph). The absorbancy in this time period increased as some of the cells began to increase in size and divide. Although the growing cells at this point are growing at the maximum possible speed, the increase in absorbance is still quite slow. This is because due to the natural heterogeneity of the population some of the cells are still in the lag phase and therefore haven't started to grow and divide at this point.
