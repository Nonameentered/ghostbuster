As the title of the question suggests, what is being commemorated is not the historical event (Nazi holocaust), but rather, ideological interpretations of it. Films (such as Holocaust the television series, Schindler's List, The Pianist, Life is Beautiful etc.) in particular fuel such interpretations of the holocaust, and by trying to recreate its likeness, is in a sense trivializing it. There is not one nazi holocaust, but many versions of the real thing. Despite the attempted homage to the holocaust, the necessary dramatization of the real event in order to make it more palatable for Mass Culture is perhaps a sacrilege to the memory of the holocaust, because it distorts how one perceives it. However, this is not to deny the fact that 'such cinematic dramatizations of the holocaust have helped to shape memory of the Holocaust in the popular consciousness' The films raised awareness amongst the generations that had no connection to the Holocaust, and as without knowledge there is no memory, memorialisation of the Holocaust is a necessary evil.
