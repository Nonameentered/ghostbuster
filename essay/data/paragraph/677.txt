An experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of background noise that is either semantically related or unrelated to printed word lists, which must be learned in one minute then immediately recalled, in relation to Baddeley's phonological similarity effect study, (1966). Correctly recalled words from visual lists were counted after participants experienced either related spoken words over headphones, random, unrelated words or no noise at all during the study phase. It was found that participants showed significantly poorer short term memory after experiencing background noise that was related to the study lists than unrelated, and that both noise conditions resulted in significantly fewer words recalled than the control condition, showing that background speech impairs the learning process and that semantically related speech impairs learning and memory more than random speech. The results are discussed in terms of their implications in learning environments and in everyday conversation.
