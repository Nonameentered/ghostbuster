There have been a number of different interpretations on how significant an impact the Black Death had on the history of Europe. The population and commercialization of Europe was already in decline and 'continued deterioration... would have been likely, even if... [the Black Death] had never occurred' It was a catalyst for events such as the Peasant's Revolt, the Reformation and the fall of manorialism, but was not a direct cause. It appears that 'the Black Death did not initiate any major social or economic trends but it accelerated and modified- sometimes drastically- those which already existed'
