Once the casein had been added to each buffer solution it was left for thirty minutes. After this period of time each sample was centrifuged, resulting in a supernatant liquid and a pellet of casein which had precipitated from the solution. Absorbency readings of each sample were then taken and the degree of precipitation calculated. These readings were then plotted in the form of a graph with pH on the x-axis and absorbency on the y-axis
