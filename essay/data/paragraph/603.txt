Perhaps more importantly, as mentioned earlier, the population was incredibly and significantly diverse; and this meant that there was no real clear unified goal of the Revolution. Consequently loyalty to the Tsar was still in place. 'The mass of the Russian people in 1905 still nourished a genuine veneration for the Tsar...even sympathisers with the liberals and democrats were loth to reject...the autocrat symbol of their nation". It seems that this loyalty was to the Tsar as his people's protector, rather than absolute admiration of Nicholas himself, and could work with the Manifesto provided that it was seen as an act of consideration by a Tsar acting on behalf of his people. 'Tsarism, which seemed so strong in 1905, had some potentially fatal weaknesses.' Much of its power was derived from its people's loyalty; support for it was not as robust as could be thought at that moment. That at least some sections of the population had not voiced overwhelming support for the government, increased the chances of some democratic changes taking place.
