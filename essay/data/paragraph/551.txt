In order to ensure safe therapies are developed from ES based treatments, a number of safety checkpoints need to be satisfied. The first is to ensure that the cells derived from ES appropriately target the cell or tissue which requires regeneration. This needs to be considered especially for cel transplants as those cells which are not specifically targeted by the transplanted ES derived compatibe cells are at an increased risk of an immune response against the tissue. As such, for particular immune mediated diseases such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis, high antigenic cells are not suitable as transplants and it is thought that cells similar to those derived from ES before they have been triggered to differentiate may be better for therapeutic use as they are not recognised as foreign by the immune system (2). Therefore for pathological conditions such as diabetes, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) may be the most suitable option as much of the own body's immune rejection is avoided.
