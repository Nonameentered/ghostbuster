It has been found by Coie and Dodge (1983) (as cited in Asher, 1990) that rejection is a stable process and once you have been rejected you are likely to stay rejected for at least the next five years. This is why it is important to look at the implications for this on the child's psychological development as it is likely the child will remain in their rejected situation until at least adulthood. An important aspect to consider with respect to this is labelling theory and the self fulfilling prophecy. When cause and effect are taken into account a child may remain unpopular because they believe themselves to be unpopular and therefore act in a way appropriate to the label they have been given. Also children are very aware of building alliances to secure their own popularity and if one child is labelled undesirable other children may not want to be associated with the labelled child thus securing their own alliances and popularity.
