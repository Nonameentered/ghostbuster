The switching costs associated with light rail systems are more likely to occur during the operational phase than at the establishment phase. Changes in technology could lead to considerable cost if an operator was to swap from one light rail technology to another. For example, a shift away from diesel-electric propulsion to electromagnetic would require considerable expense. The same would apply in the reverse direction.
