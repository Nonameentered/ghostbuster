In addition, hypnosis is an extremely powerful tool and so should only be used in extreme cases, and most importantly, when it is guided by someone of equal authority and than the authorities. It must be performed by someone with expertise in the area and following a set of standardised steps (Gudjonsson, 1989; APA, 1985) as research has suggested that unsophisticated participants make greater errors than experienced ones (LaPorte et. al., 1991). Approved hypnotic techniques must also be used and the hypnotist should only question about topics he knows will produce correct responses (Ofshe, 1992). This stresses the need for the authorities to find an appropriate hypnotic practitioner; as this case, as well as others, would strongly imply that the Detective was neither, and it is likely that his influence induced the false memory.
