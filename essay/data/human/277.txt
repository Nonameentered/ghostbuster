Judicial review represents Essentially, the concern for a reviewing court is whether the power exercised/decision reached by a public body has been done so both within the limits of the statutory or prerogative powers conferred on the body (thereby ' A decision-maker falling foul of these requirements is liable to have their decision quashed Developing this, in the seminal GCHQ case
The scenarios depicted in this problem question require exploration of each of these grounds, including the recently developing doctrine of proportionality. It should be borne in mind, however, that this area of law is by no means clear-cut, having been developed pragmatically and somewhat unpredictably by the judiciary over many years, thereby leaving the system of judicial review shrouded by a degree of uncertainty. As we shall see, the stringency of judicial review and the availability of protective substantive/procedural guarantees for individuals affected by decision-maker's actions appear dependent on the circumstances of the case in question to some extent. Nevertheless, in the following paragraphs, I shall endeavour to identify, explain and discuss the key issues raised in each scenario, with the aim of reaching balanced and informed conclusions based on core principles of administrative law and relevant cases, so as to give reliable advice to the aggrieved pupils.
The availability of judicial review is dependant on the satisfaction of two key requirements. The applicant must have "a sufficient interest These are not contentious issues in our given scenarios since each student is directly and personally affected by the decision of ABC College which itself, as a state-sponsored body, is susceptible to judicial review of its decisions in these circumstances.
The hearing-panel's refusal to consider X's medical report could well provide the basis for a successful challenge of the decision to expel him. Firstly, X can contend that the decision panel had neglected to take into account a matter of fundamental relevance to his hearing. It is well established that a failure of a decision-maker to take relevant considerations into account can render a decision void As a rule, for a court to invalidate a decision, it is not enough that considerations have been ignored which Broadening this requirement somewhat, it was also held that Exemplifying this, the decision of an inspector conducting an inquiry into a compulsory purchase order to refuse to hear evidence relating to the owner's conduct as landlord was quashed since the evidence was considered so
In our present scenario, while we do not know the exact statutory framework in place for determining the panel's discretion, it is clear that the evidence provided by X was highly relevant to the outcome of the hearing, since the panel's ability to make a decision is wholly dependant on the establishment of a second positive test. Thus, one can strongly contest that the panel was under an obligation to consider professional evidence which highlighted the possibility of that test being redundant, and by ignoring it the panel acted unlawfully
X might also argue that in ignoring the possibilities highlighted by the medical report, and therefore by basing its decision on rebuttable evidence, the panel made an error of material fact. The House of Lords has established a ground of review based on mistake of fact amounting to 'unfairness' The presence of these factors in X's case is evident, and so I submit that a strong challenge to the school panel's decision can be made on this ground
The arguments against the policy of automatic expulsion, however, may be less likely to succeed. An aggrieved individual challenging the rationality of a policy faces the exigent task of convincing the court that it satisfies the As commentators note, the test was Accordingly, this route would be unlikely to yield success for X. It would seem well within the boundaries of reason to automatically expel a pupil for twice committing an offence noted for its gravity and "
However, the doctrine of proportionality, having developed under ECJ and ECtHR jurisprudence, has infiltrated British law over recent years Whilst there is a degree of overlap between In cases where fundamental rights are being impeded by a public body's decision, this amounts to the courts having to balance the importance of the objective pursued, and the means used to accomplish it, with the right of the party to which their decision is addressed
In our case, the balance to be struck is a difficult one. A decision to exclude a child permanently from school has been noted as being perhaps The school may argue, however, that the policy of automatic expulsion provides a necessary threat to deter drug use by students, so as to achieve their objective of I would submit that, balancing these arguments, considering the abovementioned scope for error in the initial hearing, and acknowledging the Court of Appeal's indication that the decision to exclude should be
Y's concerns in this scenario are in effect allegations of procedural impropriety against the school panel and this necessitates an exploration of the rules of natural justice in accordance with Lord Diplock's direction in the aforementioned GCHQ case.
In administrative law, Exemplifying the court's pragmatism in this area, case law has demonstrated that this is essentially a question of the degree of formality in the decision-making process as to how stringently natural justice rules might be imported to regulate the decision-maker. The seminal decision in Ridge v. Baldwin
When dealing with allegations of bias, the question to consider is whether  While, historically, the judiciary seemed more reluctant to find against a decision-maker on this ground, recent decisions indicate a greater willingness to do so We should nevertheless bear in mind Lord Woolf's stipulation that "the evidence [regarding bias] must be compelling" While a direct pecuniary interest automatically disqualifies a decision-maker For example, a coroner's decision not to resume inquests into the deaths caused by a sinking ship was quashed due to his description of the bereaved parent's as "unhinged" and "mentally unwell" In another case, an adjudicator's statement that he would have been a "traitor to his position", as a member of a strict temperance sect, if he had voted to grant a license, meant the order of refusal was quashed by the court Statements of this kind therefore seem sufficient as compelling evidence in demonstrating bias to such an extent as to render the decision void by a reviewing court.
However, in Y's case we know not of any statements made by the teachers from which bias might be imputed; Y's allegations relate to (i) a previous unfavourable course of dealing with one teacher and (ii) another's anti-drugs inclinations. The first, it can be argued, would be unlikely to cross the requisite threshold for a finding of bias since it has been held that even where the parties concerned had previously been engaged in litigation against one another, this was not sufficient to invalidate a decision Nevertheless, in an analogous case, the Administrative Court found it objectionable that a teacher who had, in a previous affair, decided against the applicant pupil, was later allowed to sit on a hearing panel dealing with the pupil's exclusion
Given this apparent room for inconsistency in case-law, it is useful to refer here to dictum of Lord Woolf for clarification, who, indicative of the court's pragmatism, states: This conceivably raises Lord Hope's threshold and, considering the apparent lack of "compelling evidence" of actual bias in the form of statements or otherwise, Y's argument thus seems destined to fail on this count.
Regarding the anti-drugs campaigner, Y's allegations of bias could similarly be held redundant. The courts have frequently indicated that an adjudicator who has demonstrated that he holds strong views on some relevant matter might not be disqualified from making a decision, provided a fair trial is given Illustrative cases include one where licensing justice was not disqualified even though he was a devout teetotaller The decision that Lord Hoffman's attachments with Amnesty International precluded him from adjudicating over the extradition of a former head-of-state in Pinochet While further information is needed as to establish whether the aforesaid fair trial requirement was met and all evidence was considered in Y's case, given these precedents, the pragmatism of the courts and Lord Woolf's requirements of compelling evidence of actual bias, the teacher's anti-drugs affiliation would appear an unlikely ground upon which to successfully challenge the panel's decision.
The final allegation in Y's case is a more clear-cut example of procedural impropriety and one likely to enable a successful challenge of the decision. The teacher's unconsciousness during the hearing meant his/her presence was effectively negated and therefore the panel, Exemplifying this, the Court of Appeal decided that a hearing by a tribunal which included a member who appeared to have fallen asleep did not give the appearance of the fair hearing to which the party was entitled, and so the decision was set aside
A possible limitation on this right has, albeit on few occasions, found favour in the House of Lords. In  However, Y could strongly argue that she has a case of substance, given that her suspension from school comes at an extremely untimely period of the GCSE year, coupled with the fact that the length of suspension, a whole term, is arguably disproportionate to the offence of using cannabis - a low-class substance which should arguably result in the minimum penalty of a weeks suspension. It might also be argued that she had a legitimate expectation based on assurance given to her by the school that her case would be heard by three teachers. With one having been asleep, the panel therefore failed to give effect to this, causing unfairness in Y's hearing.
The allegations made here are essentially that irrelevant considerations and improper motives were taken into account by the hearing panel which wrongly influenced their decision to expel Z from school.
There is a well established doctrine in administrative law that Regardless of any such distinction between the grounds of review pursued
When considering whether an irrelevant consideration has been taken into account, a great deal depends on the extent of discretion afforded to the decision-maker. For example, where education authorities had the power to require the dismissal of teachers on 'educational grounds', they acted But where they had an unrestricted power of dismissal, they were held entitled to dismiss teachers simply because they were house-wives and deemed less satisfactory and less in need of employment than single women, so as to achieve their statutory purpose of 'maintaining efficient schools'
Turning to our hypothetical scenario, it is difficult to ascertain the breadth of discretion afforded to the school panel in deciding upon the appropriate penalty for a positive drugs test. We know they were entitled to consider both what class of drug was found and also the ' This could be interpreted as giving it wide discretion, and therefore the consideration of Z's poor grades may have been within the ambit of the school's decision-making process However, this is arguably restricted by the next clause which limits the definition of If this was the case, then both the consideration of his grades and the alleged financial motives of closing the specialist course could be considered irrelevant, thereby making the decision
Attention must, however, be drawn to a crucial caveat to these rules. Case-law demonstrates that " It was argued earlier that the reasonableness requirement would appear to be satisfied in these cases of expulsion for drug-use. Furthermore, considering the seriousness and illegality of consuming Class A drugs, the need to base the decision to exclude on anything else would appear entirely precluded, and thus Z's arguments would not, in my opinion, lead to a successful challenge through judicial review.
The availability of a right of appeal against the decision-making panel might deter the courts from interfering through judicial review. Case-law has produced a crop of judicial statements supporting the principle that an applicant However, as Wade notes, Lord Oliver indicated that to exclude judicial review on this ground was
To comprehend how the courts come to balance this evident tension, I turn to the Applying this statement to our hypothetical scenarios, this essay has argued that in X's and Y's case, but perhaps not Z's, the panel acted improperly to a considerable extent so that judicial review might be appropriate regardless of their right to appeal. However, considering the fact that the defects in all cases could easily be 'cured' by appeal
