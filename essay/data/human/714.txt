The laboratory session was carried out to find the moment of inertia of three metal discs of different sizes. The laboratory was carried out in groups of two and used a method to find the time taken for the provided weights to travel down a distance of the height of the stand provided with different sizes of discs. Multiple readings were taken for time to make it more accurate and this was an easy procedure to carry out because there were two members in the group to do different activities simultaneously.
Two graphs were drawn for each disc and the theory used for this method used is further described below.
Below is the theory used for the calculations done and for taking the readings:-
And,
(Note: )
Therefore:
and
Therefore:
(but , )
Therefore:
The above equation is the main equation used to calculate inertia of the each disc and the graphs are plotted in accordance with the equation to make it easier to fit the values derived right in to the equation.
For the graphs to be sketched the  value was required, the table below shows the  values for the maximum and minimum timings for each disc;
Then two graphs (a maximum timings graph and a minimum timings graph) of mass  'm' versus  are plotted for each disc;
The graphs of small disc;
The graphs of medium disc;
The graphs of Large disc;
Then the gradients () of each line (min and max) was found which is equal to .
Then by substituting these values in the main equation the inertia of the discs are found;
For the small disc (min);
For the small disc (max);
For the medium disc (min);
For the medium disc (max);
For the large disc (min);
For the large disc (max);
(All the calculations done and the answers obtained carry certain degree of uncertainty due to the rounding off of numerical data and due to the errors mentioned in the '4.0 Results and possible errors' section.)
The maximum values and minimum values of the inertia for each disc matches with each other to a certain extent showing that the experiment was successful, even though some values obtained are slightly deviated. All the graphs plotted have a similar linear shape with most points fitting close to the best fit lines with a few deviated points.
