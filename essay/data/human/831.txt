On physical examination, it is important to look for a postural drop in blood pressure readings. A full cardiovascular examination should be carried out to determine any arrhythmias such as Atrial Fibrillation for which Loss of skin turgor and dry mucous membranes will help to determine whether

History and examination confirm some the initial possible diagnosis of A review of his medication is required, although the change in systolic BP between lying and standing was not significant. Arrhythmias seem an unlikely cause as nothing was noted on examination but an ECG will rule out any cardiac abnormalities. There was nothing else to note of significance on

 He has on occasions hit his head as he has fallen and as he continues to fall he will find himself becoming less confident about walking and become less mobile. It is important to minimise his risks of falls to help

Instability, the principal feature of which is falls, is a common feature of elderly people. 20% of 65 to 69 year olds have had a fall in the past 12 months, 40% of people over the age of 80 (1). Falls have important implications both on the personal level and on the level of the cost to the NHS; a large burden of care is placed by people falling and needing inpatient treatment, not to mention the considerable morbidity and mortality suffered by this group. Roughly 50% of falls in the elderly follow a trip or an accident, with a mere 5% caused by dizziness. 5% are accompanied by loss of consciousness, 10% are a result of the legs giving way for no known reason. The remaining 30% are unexplained. (1)
The reasons for increasing rates of falls and morbidity associated with falls in the elderly are broadly based on:
poorer motor responses, with some abnormal gaits, such as that of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease being more common in the aged
poorer protective mechanisms - where the elderly fail to put out their arms to save themselves, leading to reduced upper limb morbidity but increased damage to other structures
loss of fitness, as a result of disuse, often as a result of society's expectations
Cardiovascular causes of falls include:
Postural hypotension: - secondary to intercurrent illness aggravated by chronic venous insufficiency - age associated autonomic neuropathy - drugs (diuretics, nitrates, tricyclic antidepressants, sedatives hypnotics and neuroleptics)
Arrhythmias: - Age associated idiopathic fibrosis of conducting tissue may cause sino-atrial exit block, sick sinus syndrome, paroxysmal AF or heart block.
