In the recent case of This statement continues the tradition in this jurisdiction of precluding any system of law that does not derive from the sovereign power of a state to be referred to by English choice of law rules. More specifically, Shariah law does not constitute a choice of law for the purposes of article 3 of the Rome Convention. However, the issue in
In this paper, we first look at the current position in England before moving on to make an in-depth analysis of the issue. This paper identifies a middle-way between outright acceptance and outright rejection of We argue that non-state commercial codifications that are neutral, internationally recognized and capable of being uniformly applied worldwide should be recognized as a possible option for choice of law rules to refer to.
In The defendants accepted that the sole governing law was English law, but contested that this should not preclude the possibility of the application of the Shariah as legal principles. Potter LJ held that English law was the sole governing law of the contract. There could not be two governing laws in respect of the agreements and according to the Rome Convention
There could be no doubt that the English legal system does not recognize the choice of non-state norms. Article 1(1) of the Rome Convention expressly stipulates that the Convention governs the 'choice between the laws of different countries'. 'Applicable law' is recognized as 'the law of a country' in various articles.
However, it must also be noted that although choice of law rules do not recognize non-state norms, there are various mechanisms in place that give effect to such norms. One is the doctrine of incorporation, which allows parties to incorporate specific rules, including those of non-state rules as terms of a contract.
Another mechanism is the transformation of non-state norms into laws. Other mechanisms may include transformation of non-state law into facts, transformation of non-state law into subordinated law and recognition of arbitration awards.
Against this background, we begin our assessment on whether there should be exclusion of the choice of a non-state body.
We start by looking at the principle of 'party autonomy'. This is a fundamental concept in conflicts of laws.
However, the principle of party autonomy is not without limitations. Limitations may involve priority of protective laws, connection to a foreign law and substantial relationship to the chosen law. The legitimacy of such infringement turns on the weight of the justifications for denial. A proper balance should be struck between the two competing principles. Given the importance of the freedom in question, substantial reasons must be given to justify its violation. Only if these justifications could outweigh the importance of the freedom of choice should non-state norms be rejected.
A pragmatic concern for allowing recognition of non-state norms is related to the difficulty in identifying the precise content of non-state norms. One cannot blindly assume that all non-state laws are solid and complete. This is true for certain documents produced by several well established international non-governmental bodies such as the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT) and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). However, it is doubtful whether other non-state norms apart from codifications, such as the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts (the UNIDROIT Principles), enjoy such certainty and predictability. The principles of the Sharia were described as 'controversial religious principles' and doubted whether they were principles of law by the judge of first instance in As can be seen, there are considerable practical issues to be solved before recognizing all non-state norms as applicable law.
Another correlated reason for refusing application of non-state laws is the infringement of public policy. Concern for protecting parties with weaker bargaining power is expressed in various provisions concerning consumer contracts and employee protection. This has been illustrated by the pervasive role clearing-house rules plays in the field of bank deposits and collections according to Article 4 of the Uniform Commercial Code.
A reason Proponents for non-state norms accuse the state monopolizing the law-making process. Recognizing non-state norms as applicable law would undermine the state's authoritative position as the monopoly on law-making. By acknowledging non-state norms and denying them the status of law at the same time, the state 'immunizes' itself against non-state norms.
A main reason for the skepticism in choice of law rules is centered on the fact that non-state norms are privately made, 'with all the attendant consequences. Certainly, this is the view taken by the European Commission in Proposal for a Regulation on the Law Applicable to Contractual obligations.
There may be a case for choice of law rules to fulfilling the parties' will to choose a system of law that does not derive from the sovereign power of a state that governs their commercial contract. As pointed out above, non-state laws are usually already acknowledged through indirect means and refusing the application of non-state laws may at least achieve some certainty in the law. Although there are suggestions that the need for legal certainty excludes the operation of a more dynamic notion of the law, it is arguable whether domestic laws connected with greater legal formalism provide such certainty itself.
As we have seen, it is fair to that although the current position in England and Europe excludes the choice of a non-state body of law, non-state laws are given effect through various alternate mechanisms. Our balancing exercise was weighed against this background and we found that although there are certain obstacles that are in the path of outright acceptance, the justifications for infringement of the freedom of choice are considerably diminished when we consider the arguments in the business context. We identified obstacles such as difficulty in identifying the precise content of non-state norms and the possibility of infringing public policy. Although legal pluralism argument loses strength after close scrutiny, democratic legitimacy is not required in the commercial context. However, allowing parties to choose a commercial code that is neutral, internationally recognized and capable of being uniformly applied worldwide (such as the UNIDROIT Principles) would nevertheless avoid unnecessary conflicts and boost the impact of the parties' will. This view is supported by the change of attitudes in Europe and America.
