The present study sought to evaluate some methods of analyses of fruit and vegetables, as well as determining the ripeness of green and yellow bananas, the tomato content of Heinz' ketchup and the peanut content of Snickers and Galaxy candy bars.
A lower starch content was found in the yellow banana, signifying greater ripeness. The tomato content of Heinz' ketchup was determined at 212.5%. And a high content of peanut was found in the Snickers bar. The reliability of the peanut test however, was found to be inadequate in this study.
The results of the banana analyses are shown in Table 1. As would be expected, there is a higher AIS percentage in the unripe banana than in the ripe banana.
The analysis by flame photometry found a 212.5 % tomato content in Heinz' tomato ketchup (See Appendix for details of the calculation).
The Rapid Antigen based test for Peanuts found that there was a high content of peanuts in the Snickers bar. There were no results for the Galaxy bar.
The three analyses in this study established the tomato content of Heinz' ketchup, the approximate peanut content of Snickers chocolate bar, as well as supporting previous findings that the starch content of banana dissolves as the banana ripens.
An significant finding of the study is the importance of precise technique when carrying out food analyses.
