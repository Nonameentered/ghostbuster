The manufacturing of motor vehicle industry in the England can be considered to be in a rising star stage with respect to the market adoption graph. Market adoption of motor vehicle is still increasing. According to sales figures from EIU (2004) the production of non commercial cars have been rising steadily since the 1980, except for a slight slump at the year 1992 that could be attributed to external factor such as high pricing or interest rates.
Nature of the product for Peugeot is mainstream cars that appeal to middle class consumers. The product life cycle for Peugeot typically last between 5 to 10 years during this time they will provide services and parts. Revision to design of cars is generally done on a yearly basis. Based on this fact, Peugeot will only have a certain degree of control over the price of their new cars, and it will also depend heavily on competitor's reaction. They however do have a high level of control over the price of replacement parts and services.
Based on the barrier of entries, market performance and market conduct this is the suggestion for a new entrant.
In conclusion I would recommend acquiring the Peugeot. This will give us a competitive start to compete with the rest of the firms in the industry. This is based on the fact that the barrier of entry into the market is too huge for a new startup. As the market is already saturated with more than 500 automobile companies, consumers tend to look for established brands to base their purchases on.
To further satisfy the market needs, we can instead create a sub branding under Peugeot to cater for new product line such as minis. This gives consumers confidents on the new product, and does not distort the current Peugeot's product lineup and focus.
