The design of this programmer is based on removing the clutter of all the buttons and sliders. Only the buttons which may be frequently used are placed on the front of the display. The number buttons and cursor are placed on the front because it would be inconvenient to have them placed anywhere else. The main input system of the programmer is the touch screen display. The touch screen will mean that many different buttons can be placed on the screen and removed as when needed. This will aid the user in pressing the correct buttons for the correct situation. The user will be able to change settings by accessing the main menu. All of the features from the previous programmer will be accessible through these menus. The menu system will have to be designed very well to have an effective programmer unit.
