Fraud is increasing dramatically with the expansion of modern technology and the global superhighways of communication, resulting in the loss of billions of pounds worldwide each year. Although prevention technologies are the best way to reduce fraud, fraudsters are adaptive and, given time, will usually find ways to circumvent such measures. Methodologies for the detection of fraud are essential if we are to catch fraudsters once fraud prevention has failed. Authorisation and Validation of online payments has always been a week process. In this project, my aim was to design a new model to carry out online transactions in a most secure and user-friendly environment. It includes strong authentication and fraud detection capabilities aiming to detect fraudulent transaction at early stages. It also provides a transactional management system aimed to provide transaction management features to merchants.
