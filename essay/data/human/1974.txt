As shown, conservation research takes time and money if it is to be effective. The four-step programme presented identifies the main areas of work that will need to be carried out. It also highlights the importance of genetic analysis - in assessing the health of the populations, identifying if there is more than one species, choosing the right individuals for translocation and sequencing the whole genome. RAPD analysis, with PCR, using DNA collected from feathers would be the most cost-effective technique. A summary of what should be carried out on each island is provided in table 2.
