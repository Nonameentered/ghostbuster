Prior to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, the doctrine of privity "had long been a central, albeit controversial rule of English contract law",
In order to determine whether there is a need in today's contract law for the doctrine of privity, it may be useful to trace back its historical development, analysing the character of contract law before the existence of a doctrine of privity as we know it, and considering the conditions in which it took root, until it finally developed into what was considered a fundamental principle of English law.
We are told that in the 16 Thus, in
It was only with the development of the doctrine of consideration that the right to sue came to be regarded as depending upon the plaintiff showing that he had provided a sufficient reason for him to enforce the promise. "During the early years of the 19 In fact, Wightman, Crompton and Blackburn JJ all appeared to base their judgements on the rule that a stranger to the consideration cannot enforce the promise; this eclipsed the need to explain the result in
For a number of years, no doubts were expressed as to the correctness of the decision in In In the second leading case on the doctrine of privity before the 1999 Act, more than 50 years after His views were reiterated by the House of Lords, in
However, the doctrine of privity was not left unchallenged; in
According to Greig and Davis, the 'historical perspective' of Lord Denning is unacceptable; since According to Windeyer J.,
A significant challenge to the doctrine of privity was made in 1937, when the English Law Revision Committee recommended its abolition in its Sixth Interim Report. In "So on the facts of the case no injustice was done and it was not necessary for the House of Lords to create an exception to the doctrine of privity in order to give the widow the remedy which it was thought she deserved." However,
Clearly, the evolution of the doctrine of privity is intricately bound with the doctrine of consideration, certain aspects of it in particular. Viscount Haldane L.C.'s assertion, in
The view that the doctrine of privity is part of the doctrine that 'consideration must move from the promisee', and that they both perform the same function, is shared by Salmond, J. and Williams, J.,
However, a number of scholars do not agree that privity is just a part of consideration, because both the requirement of consideration and the requirement of privity must be satisfied in order for the plaintiff to enforce a contract; in this sense, it is possible to regard privity as merely a procedural rule, which comes into play only
Greig suggests that "In many circumstances, there is no practical difference in result between applying the doctrine of privity or demanding that consideration move from the promisee",
However, the two doctrines are more easily distinguishable in cases where a contract is made with joint promisees, for example, where X promises to pay a In the event that Y carries out the repairs, but X refuses to pay Z, then, if privity is no more than an aspect of the doctrine of consideration, Z would be unable to enforce the promise, for although Z is a party to the contract, he has provided no consideration. If however, the two doctrines are distinct, Z would not be "debarred" by the doctrine of privity. In a sense, privity and consideration would constitute two separate hurdles for Z to surmount and not one. This concept is reiterated in  Though the "High Court was divided upon the construction of the agreement, four of the judges were of the opinion that if, on its true interpretation, the wife was a party to the agreement, she was entitled to receive the royalties payable after her husband's death even though she personally had given no consideration for the company's promise." This example affirms that though the two doctrines very closely converge and seen to be similar in certain situations, they can be separated, and
This distinction is apprehended by the Law Commission in its Consultation Paper No 121, This disrelation reinforces the argument that a reform of the third party rule does
The Law Commission also considers the somewhat ambiguous maxim, "consideration must move from the promisee", and remarks that it may be interpreted in two ways; firstly, "it can be taken to mean that to be binding a promise must be supported by consideration", i.e., gratuitous promises cannot be enforced; it is essentially in this sense of consideration being a necessary requirement for a valid contract that the maxim was used in the Consultation Paper. The more common interpretation, however, is when it is used to mean that, "even though the promise is supported by consideration, the consideration must move from the plaintiff", i.e., the party seeking to enforce the contract must have provided the consideration. "Used in this sense one cannot, even at a formal level, reform the privity doctrine while leaving untouched the rule that consideration must move from the promisee. A reform allowing a third party to sue would achieve nothing, or almost nothing, unless there was also a departure from the rule that a plaintiff could not sue on a contract if it has not provided consideration. Used in this sense, the rule that consideration must move from the promisee and the rule of privity that only a party to a contract can enforce it are so closely linked that the essential dispute is whether they are distinguishable at all; whether, in other words, there are two rules or one." The Law Commission proceeds to suggest that this "dispute ultimately turns on what one means by 'a party' to a contract where the contract is supported by consideration rather than being made under deed",
It emerges that privity and consideration are not synonymous either in terms of origin, historical development, scope, effect, or legislative intention; this, however, has not prevented the occurrence of situations where the two doctrines interact with each other, or overlap, in such a way as to cause undue complexities in the law, spurring the use of various artificial and uncertain exceptions and subterfuges to avoid injustice. Such unsatisfactory conditions are created as when the right to sue for breach of contract and the loss which it causes become separated, or when the promisee
This situation was remedied in November 1999, and new rules for the twenty-first century were created, with the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999, which reformed that part of the doctrine of privity under which a contract was prevented from conferring rights upon anyone except the parties to it. According to s.1(1) of the Act, a third party may in his own right enforce a term of the contract, if the contract expressly provides that he may, or if the term purports to confer a benefit on him. If this were to be applied to an existing case, it appears that Mrs Beswick would have a claim in her own right under s.1(1)(b).
The Law Commission "does not appear to have had much doubt that the privity doctrine was ripe for reform", The second argument is non-conditional, and "focuses on the injustice to the third party."
This suggests that the doctrine of privity is not entirely devoid of use; despite the many limitations of the 1999 Act, (such as the difficulty of identifying the intention of the contracting parties for the purposes of s.1(1)(b) when it is not expressed, the problems consequent to the assignment of the rights of one of the main parties to a third party, or the requirement of the third party to be expressly identified or described in the contract), the reformed doctrine of privity certainly does offer a number of advantages, not the least of which is the instilling of greater freedom in English contract law.
To conclude, our present question may be answered in two parts; though the doctrine of privity has contributed to its share of injustices in the pre-reform years, it is difficult to dismiss it as strictly unnecessary. The doctrine of consideration, however, cannot be held to perform the same function, for though they share an intimate relationship, both doctrines are separate and distinct, and fulfil different roles in the law of contract.
