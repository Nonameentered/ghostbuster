The development of modern case law has questioned the suitability of consideration and intention to create legal relations as essential elements of a contract. This essay will consider the validity of their purposes; their accordance with the themes of contract law (e.g. freedom of contract; public policy), their consistency; and the impact of developments on the future of the doctrines.
Gratuitous offers will therefore not be enforced because there must be a bargain, and so the parties must have acquired either a benefit/detriment. However, this must merely be sufficient, and thus by not considering their 'comparative value',
The assumption is that anything of economic value is sufficient. However, Lord Reid in the majority decision deemed them sufficient because Nestle had good commercial reasons for requesting them.
Thus a detriment can be established 'legally' even if not in 'fact',
However, there are contracts in which a 'legal' benefit/detriment is not required. In The recognition of a practical benefit in the former but not the latter seems to be based on public policy. In It seems however that this distinction was quite artificial and that the courts were actually recognising the practical benefits of purchasing a public duty. They were however weary of accepting this as they were concerned with the impact policy issues such as duress and the inability of some to afford a public duty could have on future cases.
In It has been criticised for not recognising the 'defendants' right to performance under the original contract." Furthermore, it was argued if consideration was deemed necessary then future parties would have less incentive to seek a modification. Yet this does not take account of the fact that consideration need only be sufficient. Thus it has been suggested that it should be the responsibility of the doctrine of economic duress to deal with fears of coercion. However at present the doctrine is unstable and, 'as Nevertheless there are already circumstances in which the courts have to determine the probability of whether an event occurred and hence it seems that more consideration should be given to the fact that at present the doctrine is incapable of dealing with economic duress without undermining the true intentions of the parties.
Furthermore, the doctrine does not seem to be a strict requirement and is emphasised by the variation in its need (i.e. the remedy of promissory estoppel) and interpretation. McKendrick noted, for example, that there will always be a practical benefit in a part-payment of a debt, yet this was not recognised in
The intention to create legal relations is one such doctrine. Contracts, in the words of Lord Stowell,
However 'serious legal, administrative and economic problems could result if, in every dispute concerning a contract, an intention to create a legal relationship had to be proved." Therefore the courts have made the presumption that if agreements are made in a social/domestic context then there will be no intention, and the reverse will be true in commercial contexts. However, these presumptions may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary.
It is rare for these presumptions to be rebutted in commercial contexts. Furmston suggested that this may be because the rules of offer, acceptance and consideration already deal with intention. For example, the distinction between an 'offer' and 'invitation to treat' already considers whether it was intended to be legally binding.
The doctrine of intention is also important in social/domestic contexts, because the presence of offer, acceptance and consideration will not always amount to legal intent. For example, in The courts recognised that in an agreement between husband and wife 'the terms may be repudiated, varied or renewed as performance proceeds or as disagreements develop." It also makes economical sense because otherwise the 'courts ... would have to be multiplied one hundredfold'.
However, some have argued that it is too narrow as it does not reflect the agreements in a modern family. Freeman argued that the development of the family, as one that is concerned with its own private ordering, in terms of property, money and disputes about children, should be reflected in contract law. However, the fact that this presumption can be rebutted gives the doctrine enough flexibility so as not to ignore the intention of parties who really do wish to create legal relations. For example, in Furthermore, the presumption can also be rebutted if parties rely on an agreement to their detriment, as was seen in the case of Therefore, by not ignoring the facts of individual circumstances, the courts are still able to deal with these situations without having to create an unbearable burden on their limited resources.
It seems therefore that the doctrine of intention to create legal relations plays an important role in the law of contract and should not be dismissed as 'superfluous.' Its role is further emphasised by the widening interpretation of consideration. Thus the doctrine of intention must also develop in its own right so that contract law is of practical use in the commercial world.
