I visited Dudley Zoo on 27 I chose chimpanzees as I plan to study this species for a longer research project in the future. I observed the activity budget of an eight year old adolescent exhibiting full tumescence. She is one of two adolescents in the group, which is also home to her mother. I wanted to assess the amount of activity, analyse the types of activity, the substrate where activity took place, whether the presence of visitors would increase the amount of activity and whether the activity was social or self-directed.
It was a clear day, and the chimpanzees had access to both an indoor and sizeable outdoor enclosure. After an hour of unrecorded observations, I noticed that the outdoor space was rarely utilised, so I decided to watch the chimpanzees in their indoor enclosure.
The enclosure is a long way from the zoo entrance in the opposite direction to the other exhibits. I personally found it to be a confusing layout and poor signing. There were not a large number of visitors to the indoor chimpanzee enclosure in the time I was there (a total of four hours). I noted the presence of visitors as I was making observations.
I spoke to the primary chimpanzee caregiver for anecdotal information and to learn the facial and bodily differences needed to tell the individuals apart. I identified one adolescent, and also learned the identifying features of her mother.
I utilised an instantaneous point sampling method on the focal animal. At every one minute interval for 45 minutes I noted behaviour according to an ethogram refined from Bettinger (2002), Kingal. (1980), McLennan (2003), McQuitty (1970) and Nishidaal. (1999) ( I added further details on behaviours in an 'other' category, along with any external factors such as the presence of a keeper or visitors. Altmann (1974, p213) suggests that focal animal sampling may exclude acts directed at the individual by others, so I also include the presence and interactions of others in the 'other' column.
