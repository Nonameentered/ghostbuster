Both Ostensibly worlds apart, many thematic similarities emerge between the texts, leading us to question how and what we define contemporary. Religion, gender and identity have remained prominent concerns across the ages and each author is unique in their depiction of how these issues impact on their contemporary society. But, the limitations of language often force the writers to resort to increasingly innovative strategies of rendering these concerns.
Religious ambivalence permeates both texts. In Stealing 'His' McEwan supports this believing; 'The modern novelist sees man making his own world." Existentialism seems to engender spiritual and physical liberty; 'Salif Keita sounded so good in the sunshine I stuck out my arms and started spinning round slowly." Movern appears most positive when communally external and submerged in nature, angered and distressed only when others impose on her world Nature imparts the freedom and exhilaration she seeks, literarily making her feel high; 'The land was flattening out I was getting so high up and a hot haze had appeared in the clear bright light,' March's belief that Warner's; '..youth culture is not the downtrodden city youth..but the ebullient resistance to such as a position,' Outside it was daylightish.'
Like language in the contemporary world, nothing in the novel has one stable meaning, a principal faucet of much post-structuralist and post-modern thought. One strategy used by Warner to reflect this is making all images and acts explicitly subject to manifold interpretation, a motif encapsulated by the dismembered corpse. On one level, 'His' interment implies there is no God, but severing the unified body may also be demonstrative of contemporary religious multiplicity, as many reject the notion of one God and draw spiritual guidance from various religions. Religion, like the symbolic purpose of the body, is multiple. Ripping 'Him' apart may also illustrate the destruction of patriarchal dominance. Repeatedly referring to her dead boyfriend as 'He,' appears to mock the anachronistic insistence on obeying a man like a God. 'He,' is denied an identity and consequently an existence, which suggests that masculine and religious hierarchy have become obsolete in the contemporary world. If so, society may be in need of establishing new ideological frameworks. Movern's buoyant optimism when burying 'His' dissected remains, could be read as a celebratory rejection of imposed hierarchical masculine inflexibility If so, libratory free-choice in both life and religion seems to be the key to freedom and contentment.
It could be argued that Warner utilizes the variability of  The fluidity of an Mengham's description of the novel as a; 'stylistically delirious and telepathic account of contemporary social derangements,' Repeated images, places and phrases create a cyclic structure that opposes stereotypical male linearity
Movern's inconsistent femininity leads me to agree with Anderson that; 'writing about women does not necessarily make a writer 'feminist.'' Although the novel is laced with anti-patriarchal nuances, Movern remains reliant on a man, as it is her boyfriend's money that liberates her. Repeated descriptions of Movern's underwear sexualise and somewhat reduce her to the position of a fetishized object; 'I licked my fingers to roll the stockings up.'
This last point is contestable as Movern is seldom a passive female; she elects her sexual partners and controls the action; 'I reached down between my legs to move his fingers correctly.' Returning home pregnant with the; 'child of the raves,' But, as the father's identity remains undisclosed the male again appears insignificant, thus reinforcing the permeable implication that men may be unimportant in the future.
Gender in contemporary society is hugely nebulous; how it is represented often proves as problematic as how it is defined. Butler argues that now; 'There is no proper gender,' Discourse is a highly formative part of this performance; while Movern's routines are explicitly those of a female, Accepting Humm's belief that; 'gender is constructed through language and is visible in writing style;' A similar conflict emerges in the
If language is an essentially masculine medium from which woman is excluded, Such comments confirm Mills' belief that; 'We are still trapped within the notion of woman's language being deviant, powerless and submissive." If so, women must find and create their own language. Interpreting stealing 'His' voice as an empowering reversion of female subordination challenges Mills, yet, it conversely supports hegemonic notions of language as masculine, as only through a male voice, that of Warner and her boyfriend, is Movern ever heard; 'His name on the first page of that novel: By Movern Callar." Without graphological speech marks to accompany her words Movern is essentially silent, I'm taciturn." But, this is complicated by also expressing male speech without quotation marks. The reader is therefore led to question whether an author can or should appropriate the voice of another person. If a male writer can employ aspects of the Supposed 'male' and 'female' language are no longer straightforward binaries, as both Warner and Movern are published in spite of 'stealing' the voice of another sex. The relevance of authorship therefore becomes debatable, The literal death of the author prefigures symbolic death of authorial control; the originating conscience of the creator no longer exists making Movern's plagiarism questionable, as technically no one owns the text.
Movern concurrently rejects both moral and linguistic codes. Ignoring established grammatical rules allows her to narrate in her own sociolect, one comprised of compound neologisms, syntactic inversion and unique phonetic spellings that foreground the thematic centrality of manifesting one's identity, see; 'her mouth seeming right deep and darkish cause of the whiteishness of faces.' Dismantling and restructuring language enables those like Movern who are outside of the dominant discourse, to articulate their 'story' with realism and authenticity. This demonstrates both the mutability of language and importance of marking Scotland out as devolved from England, a prominent concern for contemporary Scots. Exposing the supposed cosmopolitan antithetical Londoners as inarticulate and inept, demonstrates the equal value of Scottish discourse as they; 'talked so constant you found their blethers made less sense than locals back in the resort.'
Eliot's contemporary moment was also dominated by conflict. Lanbaum asserts; 'No poem seemed to express more of its time than Adopting a cultural materialist reading of the poem seems unavoidable as much of its structure and imagery is utilised specifically to capture social disjunction. Amalgamating assorted metrical and rhythmical patterns generates an intentional chaos that reflects the uncertainty and insecurity following the First World War. Abrupt syntactic shifts convey the turbulence of an era characterized by sudden change and decaying social constancy. Fusing varied poetic forms may be representative of the difficulty inherent in establishing the desired European unity craved by many. Modernist writers began to pioneer new strategies that enabled them to express the unique concerns of the post war world, a new era unlike any other where previous literary forms began to seem inadequate. The poem's ostensibly random assimilation of images rejects order and boundaries, reflecting the zeitgeist of writers and painters engaged in a similar process. A; 'heap of broken images,' The difficulty of deciphering complex allusive networks enables the reader to undergo a crisis of understanding that engenders a sense of humiliation. The overwhelming impossibility of understanding the allusive context of each image allows the reader to share the futility and failure plaguing the characters and age; 'We who were living are now dying/ with a little patience.'
Cyclic images convey the repetitive ennui plaguing; 'crowds of people, walking round in a ring." The poem's lack of structural progression suggests there is no escape from this perpetual psychological wasteland. Entrapped in the eternal present, past and future become indecipherable. April is the; 'cruelest month,'
Pathetic fallacy animates the murky gloom shrouding a capital dominated by pessimism. Mass urbanization appears to have deprived workers of their identity and humanity, leaving them apathetic and isolated; 'Sighs, short and infrequent, were exhaled,/ And each man fixed his eyes before his feet.'
Man's emotional paralysis is exposed through Eliot's perturbing portrayal of relationships. Even when seemingly united, characters remain alienated. Alternate rhyming couplets provide a surface impression of harmony between the typist and clerk, but as the rhyme's mechanical predictability becomes apparent, an impression of monotonous indifference is created. 'Hardly aware of her departed lover', Characters often appear imprisoned in their minds, doomed to continual misunderstanding in being unable to use language effectively. Ornate, decorative language in the 'Game of Chess,' generates an artificiality that exposes the essential emptiness of modern life. The woman is; 'troubled, confused and drowned the sense in orders,' The omission of inverted commas in the man's responses and absent question mark in; 'Speak to me. Why do you never speak,' The position of women here lacks the ambivalence of Disturbing allusions to Philomel imply male dominance, as refusing to speak gives the man power to prolong the woman's anxiety. Philomel is; 'so rudely forced,' Movern can be deemed as equally subservient if her voice and actions are seen to be subject to masculine regulation. To an extent, like Lil she is trapped by pregnancy, although Movern's life is not devoted to fulfilling the sexual needs of a husband who; 'wants a good time." Ascertaining how much the position of women has changed is highly problematic; although they appear stronger in
Nameless and faceless characters pervade No central voice dominates narration; continual changes in pronoun and tense leave the reader doubting each character's gender, nationality and perspective. Warner also depicts fragmentary characters whose personalities are often encapsulated by their nicknames. Chameleonic identities and the limitation of subjectivity are often seen as more post-modern concerns. Bertens claims; 'the..stable subject of modernity has been replaced by a postmodern agent whose identity is largely other-determined and always in process,' What we define contemporary again becomes contestable, as certain dilemmas are not new or exclusive to one era. Jain contests this to a degree, interpreting the poem's hetroglossic pollyvocality and dislocated vocalization as demonstrating that;
The infiltration of foreign languages supports this by creating a sense of displacement that reflects the absence of European geographical stability.
Ironically, the more languages and voices used in the poem, the less understanding seems to exist. Discontinuous, depersonalised voices often merge, as dialogue, monologue and fragmented streams of consciousness coexist confusingly. Language almost becomes a barrier that prevents communication;
Structuralist theory supports the notion that language cannot convey meaning; As in many of the relationships depicted, verbal interaction appears pointless, as ascertaining a definitive sense of what someone else means through their language alone seems impossible. Experimental strategies such as objective correlative and sensory manipulation therefore become paramount in evoking elusive states of mind that language alone cannot convey. Auditory descriptions such as; 'drip drop drop drop drop,' Drawing our focus to only the aural properties of water make it a physical sound alone, like the deluded traveler we can only hear it as; 'there is no water." Certain inexpressible emotions are fundamentally vague and can only be realistically depicted through obscure methods such as imagery. Nature becomes a metaphor for contemporary humanity, 'sunken' and 'limp,' Infinite death appears to replace the promise of eternal life. The response to the unanswerable question; 'Who is the third who walks always beside you?" is formed by a figurative image of the grim reaper; 'There is always another one walking beside you/ Gliding wrapt in a brown mantle, hooded." Powerful visual images become a substitute for a language that is unable to articulate the horror of a modern world where hope is nonexistent.
Tobain supports this argument; 'For Eliot, these visions of contemporary society are inseparable from the loss of faith. Man no longer believes." But this is contestable if we believe the thunder offers a way forward, as the poem's focus on religious futility may be an attempt to capture a moment of extreme potential. Change is desperately needed; in unifying Buda and St Augustine As is possibly implied in the novel, nature may hold 'the key' By leaving the decision to follow or reject the thunder's advice in the reader's hands, Eliot refuses to provide a conclusive resolution, a common feature of Modernist writing. The sinister repetition of; 'London Bridge is falling down falling down,' The poem purposefully lacks closure; ending without a full stop implies that there is no one solution to the problems presented. I believe Murphy encapsulates Eliot's intention effectively;
As in
Particular dilemmas continually affect humanity making it appear as though nothing is new, a key component of post-modernist thought. Both texts to an extent support Monteith's belief that; 'contemporary fiction is a barometer of the nation's intellectual health,' Certain questions remain irresolvable as no author or age appears to have the solution, an unsettling implication that forces the reader to address the inadequacies of both man and language. The one thing seemingly set to change are the strategies used to manifest these concerns, as both Warner and Eliot show language to be as unstable and mutable as our concepts of identity, gender and religion.
