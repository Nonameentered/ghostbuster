The most likely cause of Osteoarthritis is a disease of the synovial joints characterised by loss of articular cartilage and periarticular bone response (osteophytes, bone cysts, subchondral bone sclerosis). By the age of 40 90% of all people have some degenerative changes in the weight bearing joints [1] and the prevalence of OA increases with age. OA can affect many joints with the hip and knee being the major cause of disability.
Signs to look for on examination to support a diagnosis of OA are tenderness on palpation of the right knee joint, crepitus of the patellofemoral joint on movement and a limitation of the range of movement. The knee joint may also be unstable with evidence of effusion and wasting of the quadriceps muscles. Palpation of osteophytes along the joint line may be possible. There may also be a varus deformity of the leg depending on which compartment of the knee joint if most affected by the arthritis.
Differential Diagnoses:
 Pain from the hip joint can radiate to the knee as both joints have the same nerve supply.
Inflammatory Arthritis e.g.  Pain and stiffness is worse in the morning and can last for several hours compared to OA where the post rest pain is of shorter duration. On examination the knees are painful, swollen (due to synovial thickening) and warm to the touch. Bow-leg, knock knee, or flexion deformity may occur. On x-ray the bone appears osteopaenic compared to OA where the bone is sclerosed. scleritis, vasculitis, subcutaneous nodules
 It affects mainly the peripheral joints e.g. toes, ankle and small joints of the hand but can affect the larger joints such as the knee. Signs to look for on examination are redness, a hot joint on palpation, swelling and gouty tophi around the joints (especially the olecranon and in the pinna of the ear). In an acute attack, the onset is very sudden and so this is an unlikely diagnosis in Pseudogout more commonly affects the knee but is usually asymptomatic and therefore an unlikely diagnosis in
 The pain is usually most severe around the pelvic and pectoral girdles with the tenderness arising from the muscles rather than the joints making this an unlikely diagnosis for However, she has been diagnosed with this condition and so it should still be considered as a possible cause for her pain.
The examination supports a working diagnosis of osteoarthritis in Classical signs of OA were elicited on examination - joint line tenderness on palpation with crepitus and pain on movement, varus deformity of right leg. Flexion was also limited in the right knee.
On examination there was no redness or swelling of any other joints and no temperature difference between the 2 knees. There were no gouty tophi or rheumatic nodules present on examination and there is no known family history of such conditions. Such findings make the diagnosis of gout or rheumatoid arthritis less likely.
No abnormality could be found in There is no recent or past history of trauma as a possible cause of pain in the knee.
Radiological examination will confirm the working diagnosis of OA. Classic signs to look for are:
Osteoarthritis can be graded according to the severity of cartilage damage, however this is only possible during arthroscopy or at the time of surgery:
Grade 1 - Softening
Grade 2 - Fibrillation
Grade 3 - Fissures
Grade 4 - Denuding
Physical - Despite
Social - The decrease in
Psychological - Until recently, However over the last 3-4 months the pain has increased in severity and
The knee joint is one of the commonest causes of disability from OA with the medial compartment most commonly affected. The pain and limited movement experienced by patients with OA imposes a huge physical disability to the individual. This can reduce a patient's quality of life and lead to further morbidity.
The main principle in the treatment of OA is to treat the patients symptoms and disability and not the radiological appearance of the OA. The aim should be to alleviate pain, improve function and decrease disability. The patient should also be educated about OA and its management.
Treatment:
 This helps to improve the stability of the joint and reduce the pressure placed on it. Pressure on the joint can also be relived through the use of walking aids.
 If the pain is still severe, intra articular corticosteroid injections can produce short-term improvement in joint pain [2]. A gradual decrease in the effectiveness of such injections indicates an increase in severity of the disease. Limited evidence has shown that intra articular glucocorticoid injections into the joint reduced pain for 1-4 weeks compared with placebo [3]. However, studies have also shown that overuse of corticosteroids can lead to progression of the disease [1]. Hyaluronic Acid injections may offer a longer more durable response with improvement in pain and function when compared to Corticosteroids [2]. The public sector has been overwhelmed with publicity regarding the effectiveness of Glucosamine in the treatment and prevention of osteoarthritis. Previous reviews have shown that Glucosamine taken for 6 weeks decreased pain and improved function in people with OA [4]. However, poor quality of trials and publication bias has questioned the reliability of such information. Further research and clarification in this area is needed and may help to optimise future management of OA.
1) Tibial Osteotomy - can correct the varus deformity of medical compartment OA and adjust the line of weight bearing so that the healthy compartment takes more weight. The operation is not always effective and the patient normally requires a TKR at a later date [5]. This option was not indicated for
2) Low Femoral osteotomy - for patients with a valgus deformity of > 10 degrees and wearing of the lateral compartment.
3) Hemi arthroplasty - Lateral and Medial components of the knee joint are replaced (femoral and tibial surfaces).
4) TKR - All three compartments of the knee (medial, lateral and patella) are replaced. The articulating surfaces are replaced with metal and plastic prostheses to provide a low friction interface. Evidence has shown that TKR provides patients with pain relief, increased function and an improvement in quality of life [6].
The surgery performed on Good or excellent outcomes were reported in 89% of these people [7]. The pain Unicompartmental knee replacements are possible, indeed one RCT found that unicompartmental knee replacements were more effective than tricompartmental replacement at 5 years follow up [8]. However, A total knee replacement was therefore more suitable for
In the healthy knee, the Posterior Cruciate Ligament acts as an anterior constraint for movement of the femur on the tibia providing the knee joint with posterior stability. A total knee replacement aims to reproduce movements of the knee and the stability of the joint, therefore retaining the PCL will obviously assist with this. At present the decision to retain the PCL depends on its degenerative status, the type of implant used or just personal preference [9]. A possible area for research would be to investigate the advantages/disadvantages of retaining or sacrificing the PCL in a total knee replacement.
Approximately 30,000 TKR are carried out in England and Wales each year and it is estimated that the need for all joint replacements will increase by approx 40% over the next 30 years [10]. One of the main reasons for the prospected increase is the growing size of the ageing population. It is thought that the average total knee replacement lasts for approximately 15 years, however this depends on a number of factors relating to the patient including their age, level of activity and weight.
Knee arthritis is slightly more common than hip arthritis, in women over the age of 74 the incidence is 43 per 1000 [11]. It is estimated that 20 per 1000 people in the general population would benefit from total knee replacement, however many of these individuals are not referred for surgery despite 4 per 1000 having extreme disability [11]. The management of waiting lists is major political issue; current thinking suggests that a standardised priority assessment criterion for common elective procedures such as total knee replacement should be introduced [11]. Patients will be prioritised according to a clinical scoring system, which will prioritise patients according to the pain and disability associated with their knee arthritis [10].
Complications of total knee replacement are as for all forms of surgery but also include:
 These are some of the most common reasons for re operation.
 The aetiology is not fully understood, loosening of the prostheses leads to mechanical instability and ultimately failure of the prosthesis.
 This occurs in less than 1% of patients and the aetiology is unknown. Conservative management includes anti-inflammatory medication, physiotherapy, and reassurance. In severe cases the joint may need to be replaced and if this fails the joint may need to be fused [12].
It is therefore important that patients are informed of the possible complications of surgery so that they are able to make an appropriate informed decision. Surgery poses risks at any ages but in the case of
