The phenomenon of Currency Substitution (CS) has a long tradition in economic literature The term refers to a situation where a foreign currency is utilized as a medium of exchange by agents in a particular economy (Calvo and V This phenomenon is particularly important when the domestic currency is not fully credible, probably associated with a lack of confidence in the monetary policies applied in the country.
If CS holds, agents will swap the domestic for foreign currency as the domestic exchange rate tends to depreciate. This approach has been utilized in the empirical literature on CS, where a demand for money function is augmented with the introduction of the exchange rate (Arango and Nadiri, 1981).
The econometric testing of CS with a vector error correction (VEC) model has been applied in different developing countries with diverse results. For instance, Pozo and Wheeler (2000) did not find evidence of CS in Singapore against the US dollar. On the other hand, Bahmani-Oskooee and Techaratanachai (2001) and Prockal. (2003) found evidence of CS in Thailand and Latin-America,
The objective of this paper is to test the CS phenomenon in Argentina with a VEC model utilizing a simple open-economy money demand function. As usual in the literature on VEC models, the technique developed in Johansen (1988) and Johansen and Juselius (1990) to determine the cointegration relations is applied.
As non-normalities in the residuals of the first vector autoregressive (VAR) formulation were found, the nonparametric test proposed by Bierens (1997) is also introduced. Both approaches confirmed the existence of one long-run relation in the demand for money.
Finally, the results obtained through the estimation of the cointegration vector suggest the absence of the CS phenomenon in Argentina from 1991:04 to 2003:12.
The paper is organized as follows. Section I introduces the data. Section II discusses the demand for money equation. Section III explains the VEC formulation and the cointegration analysis. Section IV briefly describes an extension to analyse the model's short-run dynamics. Section V concludes.
After the implementation of the Convertibility Plan in April 1991 The economic authorities' commitment to following strict monetary policy rules during the 1990s enhanced confidence in the domestic currency, showing a break with the unstable pattern of the 1980s Figure 1 shows the positive evolution of real cash balances during the 1990s.
The relative stability of the velocity of money during the period also reflects the improvements on the monetary side of the economy. I constructed a pseudo-velocity variable, replacing the corresponding level of prices with the nominal effective exchange rate (See figure 2). The empirical evidence on the validity of the PPP in the long run supports this assumption Furthermore, the evolution of the pseudo-velocity was plotted with the interest rate in order to appreciate the long-run behaviour of these variables.
Figure 2 shows a similar trend in the pseudo-velocity of money and in the interest rate, suggesting the existence of a long-run relationship between them. In Figure 3 the evolution of the Industrial Production Index was plotted, showing important variability during the 1990s.
The variables included in the model are the real demand for money The monetary aggregate is real M1 As a proxy of the real income the monthly industrial production index was utilized (IP). Both, M1 and IP are seasonally adjusted.  The exchange rate is the effective market exchange rate measured as units of Argentine pesos per unit of US dollars. All the variables are in logarithms, the sample period is 1991:04 to 2003:12 and the data were obtained from the Central Bank and the Ministry of Economy of Argentina.
Table 1 summarizes the descriptive statistics of the data. Non-normality in the variables is remarkable. Also important is the high volatility present in The number of observations is considerable, which supports testing for long-run relations
Following Prockal. (2003) a log-linear model of demand for domestic currency in open economies will be tested. The money demand function takes the following form:
(1)
where the only variable not defined previously is As usual, the sign of b (i.e., income elasticity) is expected to be positive and the interest rate elasticity reflected in c is expected to be negative. Finally, the sign of d (i.e., exchange rate elasticity) will depend on the existence of the CS phenomenon.
If CS holds, as the exchange rate increases (i.e., depreciation of domestic currency), agents will substitute domestic for foreign currency (Prockal. 2003, p.421). In this situation d is expected to be negative. On the other hand, a positive value of d means that CS does not hold
The cointegration analysis followed in this paper corresponds to the Johansen (1988) and Johansen and Juselius (1990) approach (hereafter Johansen technique). Among other benefits, the Johansen maximum likelihood (ML) technique is easily applicable in multivariate frameworks, but is based on the assumption of Gaussian errors in the VEC specification. For this reason, as a last step in the analysis the non-parametric Bierens (1997) test for cointegration will be addressed.
Following the empirical work on the monetary transmission mechanisms
After considered this VAR formulation with the endogenous variables defined in (1) and 6 lags, a number of empirical anomalies were found in the IRFs. Most of these non-well behaved results are associated with the broadly-denominated These
Peersman and Smets (2001) proposed focusing on certain exogenous variables to solve these problems, the discussion of this framework being the objective of the next subsections.
The CS phenomenon may have important implications in terms of monetary policy since it implies a swap from domestic to foreign currency as the exchange rate tends to depreciate. A number of empirical studies of CS in developing countries have been carried out through VEC models, obtaining results which support or not the CS hypothesis.
To analyse the CS phenomenon in Argentina between 1991:04 and 2003:12, I followed the VEC approach addressed in Prock et al (2003). In order to test for cointegration the well-known Johansen technique was followed, but several issues arose when this method was implemented.
In particular, as a possible consequence of the Argentine data's high fluctuations, the residuals of the first VAR formulation showed strong evidence of non-normalities. Since these non-normalities affect the inference in the Johansen technique, I incorporated 10 dummies in the VAR specification to obtain normal multivariate residuals. Nevertheless, inspection of the residuals of each variable indicated the possibility of further improvements in the specification.
Concerned about this problem, the non-parametric test of cointegration proposed by Bierens (1997) was introduced. Furthermore, since the results of both approaches indicated the existence of one cointegration relation and the multivariate residuals behaved approximately normally, I continue with the Johansen technique to estimate the cointegration vector.
Curiously, the normalised cointegration vector obtained with the Johansen technique does not show evidence of CS in Argentina for the period 1991:04 to 2003:12. Several improvements in the monetary policies implemented during the 1990s may explain the differences with the results obtained by Prock et al (2003) with data from mid-1980s.
Interesting extensions of this paper are postponed for further research. Firstly, the estimation of the cointegrating vector with the nonparametric approach of Bierens (1997) and the comparison of the results with those obtained by the Johansen technique. Furthermore, as a consequence of the high instability of the Argentine data, nonparametric methods for analysis cointegration seem to be an interesting avenue for future research. Secondly, it seems interesting to analyse the CS phenomenon in Argentina during the 1980s. Such an analysis may provide an important reference to compare the effects of the economic policies implemented during the 1990s on the long-run demand for money. Finally, it might be interesting to continue the analysis of the short-run dynamics of the model considering different VAR identification approaches.
 Real holdings ofmoney declined during the early 1980s, increased sharply after June 1985, ...followed by a new demonetization period withpartial recoveries in 1987 and 1988 (...)" (op cit., p.337).
 Nevertheless, when
 In particular, it is worth noting the noise in the exchange rate residuals after the exchange rate correction in January 2002, not solved with the introduction of the dummies. Furthermore, the analysis of the model considering the possibility of a structural break after January 2002 needs further research.
 The selected model is determined the first time that the null hypothesis is not rejectedutilising both, the
 Nevertheless, I decided to follow Favero (op cit., p.76), and ignore the modificationof the relevant distributions generated by the inclusion of dummies.
 I sustain, following models such as Krugman (1979), that agents increase real cash balances after a depreciation of thedomestic currency only if they do not expect further depreciations. Following this statement, it is possible to suggest that after1991:04 agents perceive exchange rate corrections as a once-and-for-all phenomena. Thus, this could be a symptom of theconfidence that agents have in the monetary policies carried out recently by the economic authorities and, indirectly, in thedomestic currency. The validity of this hypothesis is an interesting issue for further research.
 As agents tend to increase real balance holdings in this scenario, it ispossible to have a reinforcement of the original monetary shock and, thus, the effect on
