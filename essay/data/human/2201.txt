First, the three antioxidant assay (FRAP, TEAC, ORAC) procedures will be used to set up three respective calibration curves. Once this has been done, and the three procedures have been understood and verified for repeatability, they will be used to assess the antioxidant potential of a range of samples;
Each sample will be assessed for antioxidant potential with each of the procedures and the results will be done in triplicate (or five times depending upon time availability).
The samples will be prepared and then frozen so that the same sample can be tested across each of the three Assays - this will be done to try and eliminate any variation that may occur in sample preparation.
For each of the repeats a fresh sample will be prepared and again split into three so that it can be tested across each of the assays. With each of the repeats, the assays will be conducted in a difference sequence so that the same assay isn't used for the fresh (as appose to the frozen) sample on each occasion.
