100mL standard solutions were prepared by serial dilution of 0.1M NaF solution to give solutions of concentration: 10mM, 1mM, 100M, 10M and 1M. 25 mL of each standard was placed in a separate polyethene beakers labelled A to E. 25 mL of saturated solutions of each MgF
The 10 beakers were mixed well and left to equilibrate in a water bath at 25C. Unfortunately, the water baths were not functioning very well, so the temperature of each of the solutions was recorded with the EMF to be taken into account in calculations as the temperature wasn't very constant.
A Fluoride ion selective electrode was cleaned with distilled water and then placed in the first solution (A). Once the potentiometer had settled to a stable reading, the potential difference and temperature were recorded.
