Hyperfine interactions within the nuclei of Magnetite [Fe Zeeman Splitting and Isomer and Quadrupole shifting was observed in the Magnetite and Barium Ferrite samples. It was determined that both sources produced two spectra from their respective A and B sites with Hyperfine fields; Quadrupolar shifts were observed to be minor contributors to the overall spectra.
This experiment made use of a 10mCi
These rays were used to create absorption spectra for Magnetite [Fe
Upon entering the octahedral site the iron p-orbitals split from their degeneracy to form an upper pair of orbitals d
