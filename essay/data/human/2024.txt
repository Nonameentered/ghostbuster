UHT is a continuous process which involves rapid heating to high temperatures about 140
The UHT process is usually carried out above 135
It consists of 4 steps
The product is then placed in aseptic packaging that is commercially sterile and has a shelf life of approximately 6 months
(The aseptic packaging is sterilized using 30-35% hydrogen peroxide at 70-80
Prior to milk treatment the tube is sterilized by pumping hot water at 130
Safety of the product is key.

Ideally the processor would want a product that does not cause a lot of fouling, and which has little sedimentation with no gelation of the product after processing
The first aim is a major problem because of high temperatures used often result in a great deal of fouling
Steam tables are important because they enable one to establish an equilibrium temperature - pressure where the milk is heated to the necessary temperature without it boiling (Milk boils at less than 100
"The philosophy of UHT processing should be based on minimising microbial spoilage by understanding and controlling the process (Lewis 2003)."
Good quality milk should show no flocculation in 80% alcohol solution, the raw milk sample tested showed slight curdling in an 80% solution of alcohol, it was still however considered stable and the running time of the sterilizer was not shortened.
The mean freezing point depression of milk is often quoted as -0.535 (Coveney L, 1993)
Raw milk gave a value of 517m
The in-container sterilised product is of lower quality because the product heats and cools relatively slowly; furthermore the temperatures are limited by the internal pressure generated.
Selection of the optimum equipment , raw materials and processing conditions is a key factor in the success of any UHT treatment .
