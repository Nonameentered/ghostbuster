In light of the bleeding On physical examination anaemia may present pale palmar creases and pale conjunctiva. The site of the tumour can be linked to the findings on It is also common for the passage of mucus to be seen on PR in rectal carcinoma. Physical examination may also reveal a tender abdomen.
On general examination, There were no signs of jaundice, anaemia, clubbing, cyanosis, oedema or lymphadenopathy. There were no xanthelasma present in the eyes.
No palpable masses/no organomegaly
Bowel sounds were normal and present
A PR examination was not performed on this patient due to unavailable supervision.
At the time of interview Colorectal carcinoma causes rectal bleeding and stenosis, causing the symptoms of increasing abdominal obstruction seen as an alteration in bowel habit and a colicky abdominal pain. Rectal bleeding was the only presenting symptom in
Clinical examination can often be unhelpful in such cancers, as it was in this case; there was no abdominal mass palpable transabdominally and unfortunately a PR could not be performed. It is important to note that there was no hepatomegaly on examination, which is an indication of whether there are liver metastases present. To confirm this ultrasound of the liver could be performed.

In the UK approximately 35,000 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer every year (1). In England and Wales, this number is increasing by 1% every year for men (it is staying the same for women) (1). Approximately 16,000 people will die of the disease every year, making it the second most common cause of cancer death in the UK (lung cancer being the most common of all) (1). Survival rates in the UK have improved over the past 25 years; it is now estimated that half of the people diagnosed with bowel cancer will survive for 5 years or more.
Some of the risk factors for this cancer have been mentioned previously and include:
 Alcohol consumption may increase risk, especially in those with low levels of folate in their diet.
 However, there are certain families who have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer due to a variety of conditions including familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC).
The relevant risk factors for
Reducing the incidence of cancer is a long-term Government initiative to reduce cancer mortality and this is hoped to be achieved with the use or screening programmes. Where screening is possible, it is an important method of detecting abnormalities at an early stage, allowing treatment when the cancer is most likely to be curable, or in some cases, even before it develops. The National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme is due to start in April 2006
Bowel cancer is a major public health problem. It is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United Kingdom. Research has shown that screening for bowel cancer can help reduce death rates by finding and treating bowel cancer early. It is predicted that deaths from bowel cancer could drop by 15% as a result of screening. Nationally, screening for bowel cancer could save approximately 1,200(2) lives each year. Patients whose cancer is discovered early have more treatment options and a better long term outlook. The treatment of rectal cancer is usually by surgery. Radiotherapy and cytotoxic chemotherapy are used palliatively where the tumour is inoperable.
Colorectal carcinomas are relatively unresponsive to chemotherapy but palliative chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease has been shown to reduce death and progression at 12 months (1). The findings translate into a 16% absolute difference in survival and a 25% increase in progression free survival (increases in 3.7 months in median survival and 6 months in median progression free survival) in patients treated with palliative chemotherapy e.g. 5-fluorouracil alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.
The choice of operation depends on the height of the lesion above the anal verge, it's configuration, gross extent and degree of differentiation, and the patient's general condition. A colostomy may be required and this should be discussed with the patient.
Four principal operations are used:
An anterior resection of the rectum is used to treat rectal carcinoma where it is more than 10 cm from the anal verge but below the recto-sigmoid junction. It is an extensive operation since the rectum must be mobilised within the pelvic musculature. The tumour is resected with a satisfactory distal margin - typically 5 centimetres - and the anastomosis performed between the rectal stump and the left side of the colon. A protective transverse loop colostomy may be also be carried out.
Important issues raised in this case include the Colorectal Screening Programme, the issue of stigma with regards to stomas and the importance of taking thorough histories with regard to symptoms such as rectal bleeding, even when the presenting patient may not feel unwell.
The Colorectal Screening Programme is currently only set up for those patients who are at a particularly high risk of colorectal carcinoma (such as familial polyposis). With the incidence of colorectal carcinoma increasing it is important to look at the public health issue of introducing a screening programme for more individuals. The drawback of such a screening programme however is the issue of engaging individuals in sending stool samples to be investigated.
The stigma of having such major surgery and resulting in a stoma bag may also need to be addressed. Initially
The importance of diagnosing a rectal carcinoma in its early stages has been highlighted to me in this case. The importance of a correct cancer diagnosis, staging and grading is important in order to be able to make the most appropriate treatment choice. The importance of giving the patient time to recover from major surgery and adjust to a new lifestyle following that surgery has been illustrated.
