Handlling human remains seems to be a great responsibility and moral duty of making sure they are used for a purpose and they actually do provide agreat deal of important information. If we do have to 'disturb the dead' we should do that for a reason. Personally I had doubts, whether I will be able to deal with this pressure. But I asked myself a question if I had anything against if someone did the same with my remains in the future. And the answer is 'no'. But another question is if we study human remains just to learn about the past or could our knowledge also influence the future? In which case these studies would be far more justified. Despite all the theoretical knowledge we were provided with, I think the most important thing is experience, as osteology is based hugely on personal judgements, which require experience. Especially identifying pathologies seems difficult, as when someone sees a skeleton for the first time, everything looks perfectly normal, if it is not an obvious pathological change. To improve my performance the best thing to do would be looking at some more samples, to gain a base for comparison.
