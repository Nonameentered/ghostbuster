The objective of this experiment is to determine the reducing sugar content of Jam. Jam contains both reducing sugars (invert sugar) and non- reducing sugar (sucrose).
A metal dish containing sand and glass were first weighed. A minced beef sample were added and re-weighed accurately. The sand and meat were mixed and kept (with the lid off) in oven at 150 C for 30 minutes. It was allowed to cool and re-weighed.
The dried minced sample were transferred into an extraction thimble and place it in the Soxhlet extractor. A dry 250ml extraction flask was weighed and a few anti-bumping granules were added. The flask was connected and the extractor with petroleum ether (b.p 40 -60 Sufficient solvent were added to half fill the extraction flask. The heater was turned and were set , so that the solvent boils gently under reflux (2-3 drops per second). It was kept for 1.5 hrs for extraction, due to time limitations of the practical, but the proper procedures is to extract for 4 hours.
