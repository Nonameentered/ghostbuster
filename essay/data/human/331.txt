The electron is a particle that exhibits quantum complementarity. A value for the mass of the electron of 7.00x10 -31
 2.82x10 -32kg, in poor agreement with the accepted value of 9.11x10 -31kg, was obtained by using a uniform magnetic field to deflect an electron beam into a circular path, demonstrating the particle-like behaviour of electrons. Wave-like behaviour was investigated by using electron diffraction to determine the interplanar spacings of graphite crystals. Values of d 1=2.20x10 -10 
 5.48x10 -21m and d 2=1.20x10 -10 
 1.97x10 -12 were obtained, in agreement with the values of d 1=2.127x10 -10m and d 2=1.228x10 -10 m calculated using a value of the carbon-carbon bond length of a=of 1.418x10 -10m and a simple geometric description of the graphite molecule as a regular hexagon.
By passing an electron beam through a uniform magnetic field and measuring the current required to maintain a constant diameter of the beam for increasing values of the accelerating voltage, a value for the mass of the electron of 7.00x10 -31 
 2.82x10 -32kg was obtained, in poor agreement with the accepted value of 9.11x10 -31kg. The initial evaluation of the random error in i was judged to be correct, whilst the evaluation of the random error in the measurement of the diameter was judged to have been underestimated slightly. The subsequent corrected value for the error in m was still insufficient to account for the discrepancy in the value of m, and so a systematic error arising from the maintenance of the electron beam diameter was suggested.
By measuring the diameters of the first two diffraction rings produced by the interaction of an electron beam with a graphite sample, values of the interplanar spacings d 1 = 2.20x10 -10 
 5.48x10 -21m and d 2 = 1.20x10 -10 
 1.97x10 -12 were obtained, in agreement with the accepted values of d 1 = 2.127x10 -10m and d 2 = 1.228x10 -10 m calculated using a value of the carbon-carbon bond length a = 1.418x10 -10m, and a simple geometric description of the graphite molecule as a regular hexagon. The initial evaluations of the random errors in the measurement of the diameters and the value of the accelerating voltage were judged to be correct, and the possibility of relativistic effects introducing a systematic error into the experiment was discounted due to the small value of .
