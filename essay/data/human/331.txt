The electron is a particle that exhibits quantum complementarity. A value for the mass of the electron of 7.00x10 Wave-like behaviour was investigated by using electron diffraction to determine the interplanar spacings of graphite crystals. Values of d
By passing an electron beam through a uniform magnetic field and measuring the current required to maintain a constant diameter of the beam for increasing values of the accelerating voltage, a value for the mass of the electron of 7.00x10 The initial evaluation of the random error in i was judged to be correct, whilst the evaluation of the random error in the measurement of the diameter was judged to have been underestimated slightly. The subsequent corrected value for the error in m was still insufficient to account for the discrepancy in the value of m, and so a systematic error arising from the maintenance of the electron beam diameter was suggested.
By measuring the diameters of the first two diffraction rings produced by the interaction of an electron beam with a graphite sample, values of the interplanar spacings d The initial evaluations of the random errors in the measurement of the diameters and the value of the accelerating voltage were judged to be correct, and the possibility of relativistic effects introducing a systematic error into the experiment was discounted due to the small value of
