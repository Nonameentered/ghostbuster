Centromeres are essential to the accurate segregation of chromosomes during division. They are the site of cohesion of the sister chromatids and kinetochore formation for spindle attachment. Heterochromatin is a defining feature in the organisation of centromeric chromatin, and The centromeric nucleosomes have been found to contain a histone H3 replacement, CENP-A. This appears to be the foundation protein in the recruitment of other centromere-specific proteins that form the inner kinetochore. These proteins have an effect over the organisation of centromeric chromatin, and it is has been proposed that a spiral is formed, with CENP-A nucleosomes present on the poleward face, along with the associated kinetochore proteins. Many features of the organisation of centromeric chromatin however, remain unclear.
The centromere is the site found in every eukaryotic chromosome, which attaches to the division spindle during pro-metaphase.
When considering the organisation of centromeric chromatin, it is important to consider the formation of the kinetochore, the site of attachment of spindle microtubules, mitotic checkpoint signalling and the generation of molecular force to drive the movements of the chromosome. CENP-A, hMis12, CENP-C, CENP-H and CENP-I localise to a core domain of centromeric chromatin. CENP-A, CENP-B and CENP-C associate directly with the centromeric DNA. Their deletion results in chromosomal missegregation.4
The organisation of the centromeric chromatin is therefore highly dependant upon the foundation kinetochore proteins. Another important aspect to consider is the cohesion of sister chromatids. This cohesion last until anaphase, when the sister chromatids separate and move toward the poles. Cohesion is mediated by the chromosomal complex cohesin, and proteolysis destroys it when it is no longer required. One distinguishing feature of a centromere is the presence of heterochromatin, and it is thought that it is responsible for the recruitment of cohesin.
Centromeric chromatin is thought to be organised into domains that are responsible for increased chromosome scaffold/matrix attachment, sister chromatid cohesion, transcriptional silencing, hypoacetylation and differential DNA replication timing.
There is an absence of any conserved sequences within centromeres across species, despite centromeres fulfilling a universal role.
The presence of tandem arrays of satellite DNA is an organisational theme, but the subunits are simply not conserved. Many chromosomes have their own specific centromeric DNA repeats, for example chromosome 7 contains long arrays of
The determination of kinetochore formation, a key feature of centromeres, therefore appears to not be sequence dependant. For example, the secondary or tertiary structures formed through association with protein.
Centromeric chromatin has a higher order chromatin structure that is significantly different from the rest of chromatin and it is this that is proposed to mark the site at which a kinetochore is formed. There is observable conservation of this chromatin organisation, rather than DNA sequences. Centromeres contain a form of chromatin called heterochromatin, which is heavily staining, condensed, transcriptionally inactive and late replicating. It may be further defined as constitutive heterochromatin, due to its presence throughout the entire cell cycle.
Heterochromatin has several defining structural features. It is associated with a conserved protein, HP1. Pericentromeric heterochromatin, for example is specifically marked by the tri-methylation of histone H3 lysine nine and mono-methylation of histone H3 lysine 27.
The heterochromatic structure of centromeres is essential for the correct segregation of chromosomes during division.
Nucleosomes are the fundamental repeating unit of structure for chromatin folding. Histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 form a core octomer, which binds strongly to the DNA independent of nucleotide sequence. Centromeric nucleosomes however, contain a specialised centromeric histone H3, and in humans this protein is CENP-A. This protein replaces histone H3 in the octomer to package DNA into nucleosomes. Since the organisation of centromeric chromatin must be so that it can withstand the strength of the pull of microtubules, it has been suggested that the
CENP-A nucleosomes can with stand this force while the H3 variety cannot.
There is much evidence to demonstrate the replacement of H3 for CENP-A in centromeric nucleosomes. Immunoprecipitation techniques have shown a significant depletion of histone H3 in the region where CENP-A is observed to bind maximally. It also remains unclear as to whether CENP-A replaces all centromeric H3.
Histone-mediated nucleosome construction allows the formation of 30nm chromatin fibres that can be compacted into further higher order chromosomal structures. This normally involves interactions with non-histone proteins to form loops from a central protein scaffold. The
Over 25 centromeric proteins have been identified, and these proteins are highly conserved in mammals. They have various roles in centromere assembly and modification, cohesion and separation, microtubule attachment, chromosome movement and checkpoint control.
CENP-A, is the replacement of histone H3, which is involved in the nucleosomes core as discussed above. It has been found that some regions of CENP-A and H3 are homologous, as may be expected from proteins that partially fulfil the same role. The non-homologous regions are presumed to be involved in centromere specific interactions.
There is a suggestion that centromere assembly and CENP-A synthesis are independent of each other. CENP-A can deposit in the absence of the replication process, however, it is synthesised much later.
CENP-B binds to a specific centromeric DNA sequence, the CENP-B box, which occurs as discussed previously. It promotes nucleosome positioning, however it is not absolutely required for centromere functioning. Its localisation is independent of CENP-A, and it is absent in centromeres without CENP-B boxes, so its role in the organisation of centromeric chromatin may therefore be questionable. It is thought however, that it may be involved in the formation of heterochromatin, rather than in centromeres themselves, and it is only because centromeres contain heterochromatin that it is present.
CENP-C is found only at active centromeres, and disruption of this gene is lethal, with failure of the chromosomes to segregate.
CENP-D is GTP binding protein and is involved in chromosome condensation from a prophase chromosome to metaphase chromosome. CENP-E is kinesin like, and is responsible for chromosome movement and segregation. CENP-I is a protein that is not required for CENP-A localization.
Neocentromeres provide important information towards the organisation of centromeric chromatin. These are found in humans. Neocentromeres are 'ectopic' centromeres that occur at normally non-centromeric euchromatic chromatin. This again suggests a chromatin-based identification of centromeres, and no sequence specificity. When looking at the sequence organisation of neocentromeres, it has been recognised that it is AT rich, with a high density of LINEs, few SINEs and few genes. It appears therefore that CENP-A is a key feature of centromere identity.
It appears that the centromeric chromatin has a domain structure, where a centromeric core is flanked by pericentric heterochromatin. It is in the core centromeric chromatin in which histone H3 is replaced by CENP-A, and it is consequently the site at which the kinetochore is located. The pericentric chromatin is associated with the formation of heterochromatin. It may also have a role in suppressing meiotic recombination.
non-CENP-A chromatin.
Antibody staining, indirect immunofluorescence and deconvolution have begun to help build a picture the organization of centromeric chromatin. For example it has been observed that CENP-A and CENP-C co-localise on a metaphase chromosome, and that the CENP-A domain forms a cylindrical structure that covers the depth of the chromosome. The CENP-A domain is found parallel to the axis of the chromosome.
CENP-E has been found to only partially overlap, and lie external to CENP-C.
CENP-B has been found to be localized throughout centromeric heterochromatin, beneath the kinetochore.
It appears that the centromere consists of interspersed blocks of CENP-A and H3 containing nucleosomes, which each form sub-domains. When considering the linear arrangement of the centromeric chromatin, this would equate to a discontinuous arrangement of CENP-A nucleosomes. Since the CENP-B and CENP-C proteins bind DNA, they would also be implicated in a linear domain structure. Since CENP-C co-localises with CENP-A, it is proposed that it would therefore also occupy discontinuous domains. CENP-B however, binds to CENP-B boxes and does not co-localise with CENP-A so may be found distributed across the CENP-A and the intervening H3 domains.
It has been found that the size of a CENP-A region in this model, may vary widely. As of yet it is not known what the exact proportions of CENP-A and H3 are, and if their number varies from block to block.
There is evidence that suggests that the heterochromatic state of the CENP-A domain is diluted or absent. The lack of heterochromatin is also suggested since centromeric chromatin has dimethylated lysine 9 H3, shown to bind less HP1 than trimethylated lysine 9 H3 of pericentric heterochromatin. However it has been proposed that some level of heterochromatin may be required for the cohesion domain.
Combining the available data and 3D observations, has resulted in the proposal of a 3D model of the organization of centromeric chromatin as seen in figure 3. In this proposal the centromeric chromatin coils, with increased scaffold attachment. The CENP-A nucleosomes align to become outward facing for interaction with the other foundation kinetochore proteins completing the kinetochore. The H3 domains are inward facing, and may serve a role in cohesion, combined with the flanking heterochromatin.
The organisation of centromeric chromatin in mammals is complex, and yet to be fully understood. There are many distinguishing features of centromeric chromatin including Their orientation in the organisation of centromeric chromatin is in most cases has still not been determined. However, data has gradually been provided to enable the formation of models such as that seen in figure 3, and with time perhaps such models can be adapted or confirmed.
