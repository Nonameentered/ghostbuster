The oximeter is used by passing light of two different wavelengths through the fingertip. This is received and input into a computerized system to represent the oxygen saturation and pulse of the patient. Oximetry is an important device to monitor patients within a medical environment.
From investigation, we have proved that the oximeter picks up on variations in pulse due to exercise, markedly an increase in heart rate. It is vital to remember that the oximeter probe is affected by movements, and by circulation issues such as vasoconstriction. People with poor circulation to the extremities may show up differently on the computer screen.
However, the oximeters are heavily used in surgery, to ensure that a patient under general anaesthetic is receiving enough oxygen, and not going into hypoxia. The oximeter can also be used in conjunction to an ECG machine, that measures heart signals directly.
Oximetry is a non-invasive method of monitoring the saturation of oxygen in the blood, which is important in medicine to notice the development of hypoxia. It is also used during anaesthesia to ensure that sufficient oxygen is getting into the bloodstream The oximeter is a probe, which is linked to a computer, and is attached either to the patient's finger or ear lobe. In this experiment, a finger oximeter will be used to produce a graphical display of heart rate. This report will examine the differences in pulse rate as recorded by the oximeter, when the patient is submitted to rest or exercise, whilst becoming familiarized with the calculations and mechanism of the probe. There will also be a brief look at what factors affect the accuracy of the recording.
The sensor that will be used is the IPOD Oximeter finger clip. Widely found in hospitals as a basic piece of monitoring equipment, it proves to be very useful in the diagnosis and monitoring of a number of maladies.
Three sets of tests were performed by three patients of similar physical description: Male, age 18-20. This is to allow for some level of control over differences in results. All three are non-smokers, and take part in exercise on a regular basis.
Before the results were taken, the heart rates of the three patients were taken. Rich, whose apparent heart rate is 72bpm actually has a heart rate of 58. Sam's actual heart rate is 86, and Tom's is 65. This demonstrates that the oximeter has an inaccurate process for analysis. This is probably due to the spreadsheet format that it was converted into. It must also be taken into account that this device is not primarily used for measuring heart rate, but oxygen saturation.
The sample candidates were not regulated enough to maintain control. Exercise prior to the experiment may have been carried out, and the exercise during was not regulated.
It seems that this could be made into a larger and more thorough investigation if multiple candidates were used, and better control was maintained.
Other tests were briefly carried out, including the introduction of vasoconstriction to the fingertips due to cold water, and movement artifacts of the probe. On both of these, the results were severely hindered, and inaccurate. Which goes to show that the oximeter cannot be used in all medical situations, because the patient frequently has poor circulation or movement due to shivering or shaking.
Of course, the oximeter is not normally solely responsible for the monitoring of a patient. Often, it is combined with an ECG machine to directly measure heart signal electronically, as well as typical response testing to ensure that the patient is constantly under observation.
