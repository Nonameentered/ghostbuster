Prevalance - In community based studies, the prevalence of BN is between 0.5% and 1.0% in young women with an even social class distribution [5]. Approximately 90% of people diagnosed with BN are women [5].
Prognosis - A 10 year follow up study found that 52% had fully recovered and only 9% continued to experience full symptoms of BN [5]. If the illness is identified early enough, the prognosis is good.
The serotonin theory for BN suggests that there is a low serotonin level in the brains of people who are irritable, depressed and anxious. If an individual binges on carbohydrate rich foods, the level of trytophan in their blood is raised. A high level of tryptohan in the blood enables some to cross the blood brain barrier and stimulate the synthesis and release of serotonin which relieves the dysphoric mood and the individual feels relaxed [5]. This theory may explain why SSRI's have been found to reduce the frequency of binge/purge behaviours in individuals with BN [8]. Research suggests that the level of vasopressin in the brain is also found to be abnormal in people with eating disorders and OCD. The hormone is normally released in response to physical and possibly emotional stress, and may therefore contribute to the obsessive behaviour seen in some patients with eating disorders [9]. The effect of the menstrual cycle and hormonal changes on eating behaviours is a possible area for future research as
According to Lacey (1986), manipulation of eating behaviour is an individuals defence mechanism and a coping mechanism for dealing with emotional stress. Cognitive behavioural therapy focuses on the thoughts, behaviour, feeling cycle and helps to:
Eliminate behavioural patterns and develop new ones
Modify negative/irrational thoughts and beliefs
Develop adaptive responses to situations
CBT achieves full remission in 40% of patients with bulimia nervosa [10] and is recommended by NICE guidelines in the management of BN [9]. CBT has been shown to reduce the specific symptoms of BN and also improve non-specific symptoms such as depression [5].
