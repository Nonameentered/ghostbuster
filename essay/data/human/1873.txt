The diagnostic tool I will be analysing for this assignment is the thrombelastograph This is a point-of-care test for coagulation currently in use in cardiothoracic surgery and intensive care in the hospital in which I work, and which is increasingly being asked for by anaesthetists during other types of surgery, such as aortic aneurysm repair, radical neck dissection with insertion of free flap and other surgery with the potential for large blood losses or haemostatic disturbance. In these circumstances, TEG Because my clinical area does not directly finance a TEG Should this change, we would be reasonably expected to gain competence in taking samples and performing the test. Senior practitioners (such as myself) would be expected to become experienced and competent in the analysis/interpretation of TEG
In this assignment I will briefly discuss the scientific principles of haemostasis, the TEG I will discuss any evidence for its use, relevance and accuracy, and any advantages or disadvantages over standard coagulation tests, in relation to assessment of perioperative coagulopathy and transfusion requirements.

Haemostasis is the continual process by which the body controls bleeding as a result of everyday injury to small blood vessels (e.g. from mechanical stresses, trauma) and larger injury from surgical/medical interventions and major trauma. Injury to a vessel exposes blood to subendothelial collagen and substances (such as adenosine triphosphate, ADP) released by damaged cells. These activate platelets, causing them to adhere to the vessel wall and aggregate to form a platelet-rich haemostatic plug which occludes the vessel and arrests bleeding within minutes (1 Blood coagulation factors are simultaneously activated, mainly by exposure of blood to tissue factor, which activates factor VII. The various coagulation factors interact on the surfaces of platelets and other cells to generate thrombin from prothrombin. Thrombin converts circulating fibrinogen to fibrin, which stabilises the initial platelet plug, preventing secondary haemorrhage (2 Thrombin also generates further coagulation by activation of factors V and VIII, and activates factor XIII which both cross-links fibrin to increase its resistance to the fibrinolytic system and inhibits fibrinolysis through thrombin activated fibrinolytic inhibitor (TAFI). In parallel with tissue repair, the fibrin plug is then broken down over several days; tissue-type plasminogen activator activates plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades fibrin to fibrin degradation products (FDP) such as fibrin D-dimer.
Thrombelastography was first described by Hartert in 1948. A pin is freely suspended in a warmed (to 37 The cup oscillates around this through an angle of 4
A 360ul whole blood sample is added to the cup and as the clot forms the cup and pin become linked together, causing the previously static pin to rotate more as the clot becomes stronger and then less as clot lysis occurs. The rotational changes are monitored by the TEG The TEG
(See table below for definition of parameters)
Advancements in the system software now also allow automated interpretation of results. The physical viscoelastic properties of the clot are dependent on the interaction of fibrinogen, platelets and plasma proteins (Vig et al 2001), and so can be used to pinpoint any abnormality in a patient's particular haemostatic component or group of components. In simple terms, the stronger the clot formed the greater the torque applied to the pin and the wider the TEG Different traces are characteristic of different coagulopathies and in addition to being interpreted automatically by the TEG
The Haemoscope The main patient groups on whom TEG
Historically, thrombelastography was first used clinically for haemostatic monitoring during liver transplantation, as described by Kang Of particular interest to clinicians has been the use of TEG This effect had been causing difficulties in the field for some time, and the reason for it was not known. Although Harding Although the modified cups are available from Haemoscope, this variation means the positive clinical outcome in this case may not be used to support the likelihood of a similar outcome using plain/standard TEG
Haemostasis during liver transplantation, particularly orthotopic transplantation, is complex because of the major surgery involved, the anhepatic phase and the disturbance in haemostasis caused by the preoperative liver dysfunction, and is not yet fully understood (Luddington 2005). The complex nature of the disturbance of haemostatic function has not always been fully expressed or defined by disturbances in commonly used tests of coagulation such as prothrombin time (PTT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international ratio (INR) etc, (Mallett & Cox 1992) not least because of the time lag between blood sampling and production of a laboratory result, which may easily be more than an hour (Samama & Ozier 2003). Achieving normal haemostatic function is vital for the success of the transplant, and running regular TEG
The other surgical field in which TEG Patients undergoing cardiac surgery are often placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), which induces complex disturbances in the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, particularly in relation to platelet function (Mallett & Cox, 1992), because of the exposure of circulating blood to the 'foreign' surfaces of the CPB equipment. Routine coagulation tests do not assess the resulting alteration in the interactions between platelets and the coagulation cascade, merely whether platelets are present (platelet count) and time to initial fibrin formation (activated clotting time, ACT). No information is gained about platelet-fibrin interactions or physical properties of the clot, both of which are affected by CPB. Old studies (Spiess et al 1987) have shown that TEG The use of TEG Although the findings of these studies demonstrate clearly the reduction in transfusion, and are stronger than the findings in liver/liver transplantation surgery, various modifications of the basic test are used, introducing a degree of variability between assays not present with normal coagulation tests. The most common modification used is that of heparinase-coated testing cups described earlier, but other modifications have been reported (Luddington 2005). This variability causes difficulties in assessing the sensitivity, specificity and utility of TEG
In all clinical areas, haemostasis must be achieved with minimal risk to the patient. The well documented risks of transfusion, such as transfusion reaction or infection (Blood Transfusion Service 2001, SHoT 2003), have been joined in the public perception by the small but possible risk of transmission of variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (vCJD). This has had an impact on transfusion service provision in the UK, most notably resulting in leukocyte depletion of blood for transfusion (introduced in 1998-1999), which has increased the financial burden of sourcing transfusion products. In addition, the donor pool is decreasing as screening becomes more stringent and exclusive, and is only likely to become more so. Consequently, in addition to the small but possible risks of transfusion increasing, the decreased availability of products for transfusion and their increased cost demands that clinicians must find means to avoid transfusion if at all possible, whilst not compromising the health and well being of their patients. In practical terms in the perioperative field, this means both minimising blood loss and careful monitoring to anticipate the potential for bleeding before it occurs and treating the imbalance proactively and pharmacologically if possible. Thus, any tool which demonstrates an ability to reduce peri-operative transfusion requirements is welcomed enthusiastically by clinicians.
Despite the evidence that TEG Most published studies are by clinicians rather than haematologists; Samama & Ozier (2003) report reluctance from biologists to support the use of point-of-care tests and point out that none have yet been accepted by the experts of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.
Manspeizer et al (2001) found significant differences in TEG In addition, provided the clinician is aware of this potential for variability and uses only one type of sample, this should not be a problem clinically. A standard operating procedure for sample taking and processing in conjunction with thorough staff training would minimise user error and inter-user variability.
Luddington (2005) commented that several studies (Camenzind et al, 200; Vig et al, 2001, Rajwal, Richards & O'Meara 2004) have reported problems with sample stability, but these have all referred to blood that has been citrated, something that is only necessary for the laboratory because of the delay in testing. Vig et al (2001) found that a rest time of 30 minutes was required between sample taking and testing to ensure stability. When using TEG Concerns raised over variation occurring with repeat sampling from one sample of blood (Vig et al 2001, Zambruni et al 2004) are also only a problem in the research laboratory; in clinical practice, another fresh sample would be taken.
Rajwal, Richards & O'Meara (2004) were studying the use of TEG
The lack of standardization of TEG In addition, an alternative instrument called the ROTEM Consequently, when reviewing the literature it is important to ascertain which instrument was used and whether any modifications were made.
Only two studies directly comparing TEG Zuckerman et al (1981) compared the abilities of TEG This was a fairly large and thorough study, using native blood samples for TEG After statistical analysis, it was found that there was a strong relationship between the TEG The TEG Against the TEG
The second study, by Avidan et al (2004) does not directly compare TEG This used a reasonable size of patient group (102), but in addition to the TEG The study found that using a test-guided algorithm reduced blood/blood product transfusion when compared with clinical judgment alone, but found no advantage of either the laboratory-test guided algorithm or the point-of-care test guided algorithm over one another. This would seem to support the use of test-guided algorithms for blood product usage but does not provide any more information about the benefits or otherwise of TEG
It is difficult to directly compare the TEG A meta-analysis of the results of published studies would also be useful in assessing the utility of the TEG
Another issue which must be kept in mind is that of cost. I have already discussed the finance issues around transfusion, but there is also the cost of the tests themselves. I did not find any discussion of this in the literature, but it seems reasonable that the lack of processing, transport and laboratory staff required for TEG In addition maintenance of the equipment, including calibration and quality control, would be required.
There can be no disagreement that a reduction in the use of blood and blood products during surgery is needed, from a patient safety, resource management and financial concern. There is a great deal of evidence that TEG The rapidity with which a result can be obtained would be a massive improvement over the wait for laboratory tests of coagulation, which I have found in my practice can easily be an hour. With surgery such as aortic aneurysm repair, where massive volumes of blood can be lost and infusions given in minutes, by the time a result is obtained it is irrelevant, and consequently transfusion decisions are based on clinical judgment or ratio (i.e. four units of fresh frozen plasma given to each six units of packed red cells). The assertion by Avidan et al (2004) that transfusion should be based on a laboratory-test guided algorithm is not necessarily achievable in the operating theatre, both because of the time for testing and difficulty transporting samples to the laboratory. Although not yet validated, the use of TEG As a scientific test, TEG However, its sensitivity for detection of coagulation abnormalities is high (Zuckerman et a 1981) and the evidence for its use to guide transfusion requirements is strong. Conventional laboratory tests for coagulation continue to be the 'gold standard' but point-of-care tests such as TEG I believe that the use of TEG In addition, the widespread introduction of other measures such as perioperative red cell salvage, autologous pre-donation and other point-of-care coagulation monitoring (such as platelet function monitoring, activated clotting time and others) is likely to bring about a significant reduction in the transfusion of blood and blood products and thus both improve the patient experience and reduce the financial burden within the perioperative setting. The introduction of some form of guided protocol for perioperative transfusion seems both desirable and inevitable; the tests which will guide it remain to be seen.
