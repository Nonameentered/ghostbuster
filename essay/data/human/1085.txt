We begin with Amp
Set as the integration path a circle, with radius r, centred on the wire and in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the wire, with 1.1).
At each point, Also, splitting So we only need to consider
Now we can apply Eqn. 1.1 around this closed path:
Re-arranging this, we obtain an expression for the magnitude of the magnetic field around the wire:
Amp The current is flowing in this direction, so the actual current is positive, and so 1.2. The direction of positive integration is clockwise, parallel to 1.2.
The Biot-Savart Law is
We set up the problem as shown in Fig. 2.1. From this, we see that The right-hand rule for the vector product Furthermore, all contributions to the magnetic field from all elements
So now we can use Eqn. 2.1 to find the field 2.1.
So we have
i.e.
However, notice that from Fig. 2.1,
and
So from Eqn. 2.2 we have that
So
Again, notice that from
we get
So substituting this into Eqn. 2.3 gives
So
When the length of the wire, Also, when
Hence, from Eqn. 2.4, we have that
The situation is axially symmetric about the y-axis, so
Hence, at all points on a circle of radius
which is the same result as that obtained when the problem is analysed with Amp
