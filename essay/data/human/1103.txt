The classic two-slit experiment is discussed with photons. Modern variants are revealed and pose questions for quantum theory to answer. Delayed choice is introduced as a method to answer some of these questions however it raises more. The non-intuitive behaviour of quantum objects is commented upon before an explanation for the two-slit experiment is given. This is followed by various interpretations of the explanation.
