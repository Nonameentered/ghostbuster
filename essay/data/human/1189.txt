In this report a first order plus deadtime system is analysed under different parameters and control methods.
In section 2.1 analogue control is considered. The effects of system frequency and controller gain on system stability are analysed. A
Discrete control is considered in 2.2. A proportional controller with zero-order hold is designed. Using values obtained in 2.1, the final value of this system is calculated using the Z-transform final value theorem. Comparisons are drawn with its analogue counterpart.
In part 2.3 Ziegler Nichols design values are used to design a It is discretised using backward differencing and a Dahlin controller is designed; comparisons are drawn between the two.
In section 3 controllers discussed previously are simulated using the 'Sampled Data System'. Performance and characteristics are compared and examined.
Conclusions drawn are as follows;
Overshoot, oscillations and a large settling time are characteristics of the proportional only controller.
