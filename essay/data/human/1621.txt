First of all, I have drawn each static element on a paper in order to have a first idea about each shape. Then I have built these elements on SVG using quadratic curves, line, circle, ellipse, etc...using one svg file per shape. Each shape was grouped in a <g>
 element. When every shape was drawn with SVG, I have assembled them in one svg file. Each element is defined in a <defs>
 tag and instanced with the <use>
 tag in order to use it in the animation. Finally, when each element is placed in the scene, I can add the different animation in order to produce the same which is described in the story board. In this part, I will explain how each element is translate in SVG (globally) and how the animation is made, linked together etc...
I think that some elements are not very detailed. For example, every "human" are the character, with a different colour. However, I think the different zoom add to the animation "a life", like in a TV animation.
