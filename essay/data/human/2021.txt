The initial recognition and identification of microorganisms in food is a useful skill. Many of us can naturally usually tell when spoilage has occurred in some foods however identifying the actual microorganism or the extent of its proliferation in a food is another matter . The recognition of microorganisms then allows one to trace back the most likely sources of contamination or causes of excessive proliferation and take steps to avoid these in future .
A visual observation of the samples was undertaken. The liquid samples were smelled to see if any off notes could be detected .
The pH of the milk and the yoghurt was measured by dipping the appropriate pH paper directly into the sample , this was then discarded ad microbiological waste - in case it was contaminated .
A small amount of the oats porridge was mixed with purified water in a beaker
A microscopic observation of each of the foods was then undertaken .
In the milk sample , no bacteria was observed .
In the milk sample , despite the fact that the milk had an unusual smell and was overly acidic no bacteria were observed under the microscope. This demonstrates the importance of carrying out more than one test. The previous two tests definitely indicated spoilage but the extent or type of microorganism was not identified . In an industry setting , a repeat of this stage would be necessary
For the yoghurt and porridge oats the microorganisms present were clearly visible and identifiable. This shows that simple rapid techniques are effective for identifying microorganisms in foods.
