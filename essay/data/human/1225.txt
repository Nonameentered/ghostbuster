Midland Metro is one of the main transport systems in Birmingham, with 20.13 kilometres of tracks running in and around the city. Set up in 1999 with funding from a range of sources including 40 million from a government grant, 31 million from a European grant, 4 million from local councils and a 40 million approved loan, it has a planned dept lasting 30 years. This huge capital investment makes its financial analysis especially important for The Entrepreneur choosing to buy the firm or to set up a rival company.
As this company is many years from making any profit and is still fairly early in its development, it could be considered in the Question Mark stage of the market adoption graph. In 23 years time, when the various loans are repaid and the company begins making profit, there will still be large expenses on the tram system, such as repairs and maintenance, extensions to the service and keeping up with any new technology in the transport industry over the next 23 years.
Midland Metro's competition comes from other modes of transport: at the moment, cars are the biggest threat to any short-distance transport system. However, buses, local trains and taxis all pose competition to a tram system, and the tram company must keep up service and reliability if it is to remain successful. A tram system usually draws around half or two thirds of its passengers from buses and a further quarter from car users, thereby also reducing traffic congestion.
