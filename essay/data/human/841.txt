Since the end of the 19 The joint that is hardest struck is usually the hip, and accordingly research has been more focussed in this area.
A complete hip replacement is required to reproduce the kind of mobility offered by the original hip. For this, two primary components are used, the cup to replicate the hip socket, and the femur, including the ball to rotate within the socket. In practise, the ball is attached separately onto the femur replacement to allow the use of harder wearing materials, and often the cup has a lining to improve longevity and decrease friction within the joint.
The historical solution for this problem involves manual modelling, and a great deal of trial and error. Due to the demands upon these replacements, the time required for testing results in slowed development. The advance of computational methods for design and development can be utilised to minimise the extent of the required testing and hence reduce the overall development time frame.
A model will be created and a static analysis be performed. Computational methods shall then be evaluated as a tool within the design process.
