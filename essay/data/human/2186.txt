Water is present in every food, its content is of great significance in many respects, affecting properties like conductivity for heat and electrical current, density and rheological behavior, or even corrosiveness. The amount of water in food often determines its nutritive value and taste. Determine the water content of foodstuffs is important and there are four main method, oven-drying, distillation, electrical methods and chemical methods.
Plants store their surplus energy in two forms - starch or oil. Starch is stored in underground plant organs such as roots and tubers, as well as in above-ground fruits and seeds. Starch varies in size, shape, appearance of striations and the location of the hilum from different plants. We can identify the starch in plant by using the different appearance of starch.
In these experiments, we use oven-drying to determine the water in the sausage meat, and also learn how to use the microscopic to exam the starch cell in different position.
