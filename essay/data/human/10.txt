At the eve of the Versailles conference, promoters of the Polish cause immediately realised the international precariousness of their aims to forge the rebirth of an independent Polish state. Moving with caution, Pi It was only the realisation of Soviet hostility toward their new western neighbour that forced the antagonistic political forces to work together in a somewhat efficient war cabinet, though even then with the greatest difficulty and resentment. It was immediately recognised as 'a monument to anti- Pi The seed was thus planted for Pi While the direct cause for Pi
The list of problems and grievances that the young Polish state was thrust into from the early twenties was indeed impressive. While basic issues, such as the development of a political system and the role of minorities in the new state still had to be addressed, Poland was first confronted with 'a veritable fight for survival'.
National unity was far to be sought. The dominion claimed by Poland included vast numbers of minorities with loyalties elsewhere. Of twenty-seven million inhabitants not even 70 per cent were Polish, while 14.3 per cent were of other Slavic decent and 7.8 per cent of the population were Jewish, The same went for the small German minority of 3.9 per cent, whom, by conducing themselves 'in manner that was at once provocative and calculated to give notice that it regarded its status in Poland, and Poland herself, as temporary', A long struggle between Poland and her minorities persisted throughout the While it has been noted that '[n]othing the Poles did was ever right, as far as [the Jews] were concerned', On the contrary, when Poland's first president, Gabriel Narutowicz, came to be elected with support of the bloc of minority parties, he was murdered within days after his election by the Sejm. Despite the
While, to some degree, all political factions agreed with Pi This had not only racial, but also religious, economic and political reasons. Pre-war conditions of many Poles created a resentful attitude toward minorities and this made it hard to deal with the minorities in a fair way.
Politically and economically antagonistic views were from the onset a mutually enforcing problem, which caused great obstacles for the creation of a healthily functioning government. Additionally, the multitude of Polish independence parties which had formerly existed, maintained their air of secrecy and 'conspiratorial character' even when government bodies had been created, The economy, in particular, proved a disastrously antagonising force. Extreme inflation, such as in Warsaw, where food prices with a unitary value of "100" in January 1921 rose to "1298.2" in December 1922, While land reform was the way out for a country too poor to introduce any significantly contributing industrialisation, the National Democrats, with many landowning members, were reluctant to land redistribution of any real importance, This, in all, caused land reforms to be rather ineffective and certainly insufficient.
Additional to internal problems, came the issue of Poland's national security. Weimar Germany continued a revisionist policy of regaining its former Prussian areas and southeastern Silesia from Poland.
Another form of support to the new independent state which was pressingly lacking was financial aid. Having half of its roads, railways and public buildings destroyed during the Great War, The absence of foreign loans and apparent disinterest in creating political stability from the western powers might have done much to help Poland establish a parliamentary democratic routine.
The exigent situation that Poland was in did not go unnoticed. Pi Much of the PPS-cadre, frustrated with years of ineffective government and
Not just the opposition of the left had their second thoughts about the functioning of the state. In December 1925, Dmowski wrote 'if we could create even half the organization like the Fascists... I would willingly agree to a dictatorship in Poland'. University students radicalised under the prospect of unemployment and resented the apparent greater success of their Jewish peers; they formed the leadership of fascist movements that were to increase their power-base throughout the 1930s.
Overwhelmed by problems of such dimensions, historians have argued, 'some action [...] seems in retrospect to have been almost inevitable' within the Polish political landscape. An internal conflict in Pi He claimed he 'would never be a cause of trouble and dissention in the State'. Already earlier in the twenties had Pi By declining a bid for the presidency, he proudly refused 'to be enclosed in a 'gilded cage'', Rather than acknowledging his objections to National Democratic domination, he slid further back into the trappings of "moral dictatorship", hereby only united the body politic in their opposition against his rule. Thus, the peasant parties united in the Sejm to resist political persecution, While open confrontation with the initially supportive socialists became ever more discernible, Pi When, in the end of 1929, he personally came to reopen the Sejm accompanied by a hundred armed officers, Daszy The failure of Pi 'It is the basis of democracy, for which there is always place in Poland', he still argued in 1926. When eventually a number of politicians chose exile rather than imprisonment, Pi
By carrying out a While initially hesitant, the This, however, had detrimental effects on the democratic institutions and increasingly alienated many parts of society from his government. Being insufficiently successful in curbing further economic regression into the 1930s and failing to integrate increasingly militant groups of minorities,
