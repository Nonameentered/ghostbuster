Why should you always examine a slide under low power before switching to the high power oil immersion objective?
We should always examine a slide under low power before switching to the high power oil immersion see because we need to check whether the specimen is rewarding and to select an area for study or to detect motility first. Then use oil immersion objective for more definitive observation.
How many cells of Bacillus cereus could theoretically be placed side by side in a straight line across the diameter of a coin (2.3 cm)? Make use of your own estimate of the size of the cell.
From the drawing, the diameter of Bacillus cereus cell is about 3mm. As the magnification used was 1000, the real diameter is estimated as 3/1000 = 0.003mm, which is 3m.
So the number of Bacillus cereus cell could theoretically be placed side by side in a straight line across the diameter of a coin (23000m) = 23000/9 = 2555 cells.
How many protein molecules of diameter 3 nm (the size of haemoglobin) could theoretically be placed side by side in a straight line across the width of a B. cereus cell?
From the drawing, the diameter of Bacillus cereus cell is about 3mm. As the magnification used was 1000, the real diameter is estimated as 3/1000 = 0.003mm, which is 3m.

How is asexual reproduction in S. cerevisiae similar to and different from that in B. cereus?
S. cerevisiae reproduces asexually by budding. In the budding process, a new cell forms as a small outgrowth of the old cell. The bud gradually enlarges and then separates to form a new cell. B. cereus reproduces asexually by binary fission where cell elongates sufficiently to form two equal and independent daughter cells with characteristics like those of the parent cell. The two cell division methods are similar as two identical cells with the same genetic information are produced at the end. The difference is S. cerevisiae cells will only have one plain of division whereas  B. cereus will have different plains of division. Thus growth of bacteria is faster than yeasts.
On the other hand, B. cereus sometimes formed endospores inside cells and wait for suitable condition to grow, but S. cerevisiae will not form endospores.
What are the essential differences between asexual reproduction in Rhizopus stolonifera and Penicillium sp.?
Both Rhizopus stolonifera and Penicillium sp. produce spores asexually. For Rhizopus stolonifera, sporangiophores grow upright from the surface and the tip swells to form sporangia. Each sporangium contains many spores. Bur for Penicillium sp., a conidiophore terminates in three to four branched phialides and each phialide tips off with conidia. The spore-bearing structures rise above feeding mycelium. The conidia bud off in chain from the top and external to hyphae. The conidia are not contained in one coating.
