EC environmental law has been a sporadic, almost ad-hoc appendage to European competence. Initial regulation was incidental, created through measures of approximisation for free-trade purposes. Later developments became more comprehensive. I will analyse the systems operation, extensiveness, effectiveness and accessibility. This narrative cannot be an abstract debate concerning the evolution of a legal competence; it must be placed in context. Can an economically-centred union really provide a balanced approach towards environmental sustainability; will it be typically anthropocentric, restricting regulation for financial gain, an economic quantification of the environment? Or will it create a comprehensive, accessible legal order with the essential supremacy and collective resources to fight this international issue effectively?
Created from the ashes of war-torn Europe in the form of the ECSC, The 1957 EC Treaty created a more recognisable inauguration, whilst the Merger Treaty The UK joined following the Treaty of Accession. This was realised through the establishment of a new, sovereign "European legal heritage:" Directives are binding as to the result to be achieved; leaving appropriate implementation to MS's Regulations are universally applicable, automatically transposed into MS law in community form. Decisions (Article 249EC) are legal pronouncements only binding on those they address. The EC was renamed EU following the TEU,
Environmental concerns were unacknowledged in early treaties; the need to "re-organise industries and promote self sufficiency in food" Initial environmental control was incidental to regulation. Directives, entirely economic in both structure and aspiration, were used to create a level playing-field for the common-market, harmonising existing MS Whilst the EC was fertile and alive, it was in its foetal stage, operating purely within prescribed boundaries: economic development was paramount. The relatively "affluent" General responsibility was assumed under Article 2EC Early environmental legislation was invoked under Articles 94 Intended to achieve uniformity for economic efficiency, it closely linked environmental and economic policy, recognising that stricter environmental principles may limit trade, consequently condoning regulation. It yielded indirect benefits by harmonising existing, and future environmental regulation. Article 308, used for purer environmental directives, accomplished objectives that existing provisions could not realise, even if these objectives were unacknowledged in treaty provisions. Institutions had to illustrate the legal base was threatened, if so it consequently became a "catch-all" Environmental control became such an objective, thus it was assumed justifiable, particularly when affirmed by the ECJ in cases challenging the community's assumed competence.
Environmental issues became increasing apparent, yet the system's inadequacy sacrificed protection for economic furtherance, focusing on dismantling "barriers to free movement of goods, persons, services, and capital." It was reactive, operating purely within the economics that restrained it. Directives were adopted in a piece-meal fashion with "little consideration" MS's challenged the legitimacy. Articles 308/94 were unreliable and insufficient; haphazardly extending competence. Moreover, could the community's central purpose (free-trade) operate if restrained by environmental regulation? Politically the EC was still very much an economic union; MSs' were sceptical of community power and ambition. ECJ interjection was crucial to preventing regulation being "overborne by the dominant paradigm of free-trade." The ECJ however stressed Article 94's significance for harmonising and preventing "distortion;" Significantly, the case also imposes the first financial penalty relating to the environment. In Moreover, under Article 10EC It was the beginning of the "co-operation principle" It established the environmental norm of "connexion:"  It at least appeared sufficient justification to prolong Article 94/308's usage. This staggered development, whilst not ideal, did initiate a more inclusive legal-framework, the ECJ often initiating guiding principles and ideologies, e.g. polluter pays principle Yet it remained largely fragmented; divided by economic preference and imposed restrictions, e.g.
Later developments, spearheaded by a more integrated, policy-lead approach demanded Community ambitions could no longer "be imagined in the absence of an effective campaign to...[protect] the environment;" The Commission and Council created the first EAP, The first two EAPs It implored environmental principles such as the polluter-pays: "costs of environmental pollution should be borne by the person causing it, not by the community at large." Later EAPs developed control in waste (prevention, recycling, safe-disposal); air quality, and prevention of environmental harms. By creating comprehensive policy, subsequent regulation was more co-ordinated, particularly when compared to the piece-meal measures of the previous era.
Establishment of a separate, environmental Directorate-General It quickly acquired a "reputation for activism" Finally, following the 1985 IGC It was to create a justifiable, pro-active and unchallengeable regime. It introduced the principle of integration, later prioritised in the 5 The SEA recognised that MS's could adopt stricter protection above community levels (after Commission consultation), allegedly prioritising protection over free-trade. It initiated a "proactive international regime:" Pragmatically, it presents "a less rigid view of the state" "Effective environmental problem-solving cannot take place without shared environmental norms and the evolution of these norms." Its "international credibility" The EU has signed "30 international treaties since 1974."
Article 95 used QMV Co-decision procedures (Article 251) with the EP increased participation, amplifying political involvement (e.g. Greenpeace), creating a greater forum for environmental debate. The SEA (principally Article 174) affirmed further environmental principles for "formation of policy," Together with the ECJ, these have been used "as a basis for validating the parasitic legislation of environmental measures." Kramer Significant in shaping and justifying policy, I suggest they should "be welcomed"
Whilst Article 174.1 Articles 95 Article 95 centres on harmonising MS law to develop regulation within the internal-market. Article 175 allows legally binding instruments to be adopted that have direct action for "specific environmental protection," establishing purer, more targeted environmental control. The two measures created an alarming degree of misapprehension concerning the establishment of stricter domestic legislation: numerous cases arise attempting to determine the appropriate base. Traditional conflict exists between regulation and free-movement of goods (Article 28), Radically, measures against free-trade for "wider public interests" The "rule of reason" (case 120/78) may also be invoked, preserving MS rules that deviate from community principles for "overriding, wider public interest[s]," Originally only useable where "national legislation is indistinctly applicable," later ECJ development (Case C-203/96 Confusingly, potential for developing stricter legislation is dependent on the legal base invoked: Article 176 However, under Article 95(4) It presents a more willing and flexible Union better equipped to address environmental concerns, potentially at economic expense.
Post-SEA development was initially sluggish "because of political reasons linked to national sovereignty." Ultimately however, many beneficial economic mechanisms harmonising (e.g. CO2) and promoting environmental protection were established. This included the proliferation of ancillary bodies/schemes, illustrating more sustainable, two-pronged regulation: sovereign, 'top-down' legal instruments and pro-active, 'grass-roots' ground-level monitoring/development, e.g. ENVIREG, The MEDSPA programme targeted specific regions, whilst "LIFE" EEA "Likely to become more important over the next decade," I feel it would better employed as an active enforcer.
The 1993 TEU Previously, economic and developmental divergence between MSs meant achieving common environmental polices was difficult; usually relapsing to the "lowest common-denominator." Unsurprisingly, the proviso for Whilst it would be undesirable and impracticable for strict policies to simply be imposed, realistically, the EU needs to take the lead in increasing the agenda to prevent environmental calamity. MS's are too ready to promote economics above protection; presently however, the union is only as strong as MS determine through treaty negotiations. Consequently, Article 2 made modest advancement. Article 2 recognised sustainable development and non-inflationary growth. Article 3 provided for more specific environmental strategies, leading "to a large promotion of sustainable development policies," Article 174 Post-SEA/TEU development moved away from approximisation towards a "systematic framework" Founded not just on treaties or secondary law, but also international agreements, it became characterised by encouraging "'participation', 'reflexivity' and 'deliberation.'" Whilst policy is centrally determined, MS's can "implement...environmental law discretionally." Arguably, this may cause a dilution of policy. Yet the "procedures for implementation...[are] restricted," The subsequent ToA
The EU presents a "new mode of environmental governance," creating a sovereign "legal heritage" Where un-enforced "individuals or NGO's" Furthermore, it appears that "even where directives are not directly effective, individuals may...rely on the Von Colson principle:" Post-SEA/TEU development acknowledged individual's rights and obligations.  Right exists for "any legal person" Despite these provisions, accessibility is limited and societal actors are restricted: "direct and individual concern" The Von Colson principle is also restricted, as is access through MS courts by way of Standing. The system cultivated therefore places responsibility on MS's and EC institutions, to which the "ECJ must review." Is this sufficient? The 5 Effectiveness is dependant on the "political will of the MS's," "Protection policies are pointless if countries fail to keep their promises:" With restricted access, enforcement is dependant on the Commission, an under-funded, under-staffed bureaucracy better equipped to legislate than enforce. The list of breaches is "getting longer rather than shorter."
Pre-SEA measures had "weak foundation[s]." Fragmented and unreliable, it resisted real protection for economic advancement. The SEA, ECJ and EAPs sustained an increasingly decisive, policy-lead approach through principles and objectives; a dream of environmental sustainability. Finally, a consciousness exists that we cannot prolong Earth's exploitation for economic furtherance, how ironic it should come from an economic union. It fabricated a comprehensive system with "more hope, more chance, more opportunity than most people are prepared to understand or accept:" Originally staid and inflexible, the normative structure now implores "participation," Economics define the modern world. This regime can make environmental regulation intrinsic to economic advancement, realising sustainable values. Yet the "proliferation" Inaccessible, intangible and poorly enforced it is too dependent on the "political will of... MSs." The EEA needs to evolve into a regulatory/enforcement body to realise the system's full potential. The EC is the "most important influence" The UK has an acceptance problem. No longer are we supreme. We must co-operate. "No environmental matter, except possibly dog mess and litter, can be dealt with...nationally." Will we have the courage to advance, or will our history "stultify us in a...sentimental attachment to a world that is past."
