Why should you always examine a slide under low power before switching to the high power oil immersion objective?
We should always examine a slide under low power before switching to the high power oil immersion see because we need to check whether the specimen is rewarding and to select an area for study or to detect motility first. Then use oil immersion objective for more definitive observation.

How is asexual reproduction in
 In the budding process, a new cell forms as a small outgrowth of the old cell. The bud gradually enlarges and then separates to form a new cell.  The two cell division methods are similar as two identical cells with the same genetic information are produced at the end. The difference is Thus growth of bacteria is faster than yeasts.
On the other hand,
What are the essential differences between asexual reproduction in
Both For Each sporangium contains many spores. Bur for The spore-bearing structures rise above feeding mycelium. The conidia bud off in chain from the top and external to hyphae. The conidia are not contained in one coating.
