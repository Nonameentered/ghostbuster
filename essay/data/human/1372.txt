In this essay I will try to assess whether it is possible, within the current Western framework, to think of a theory of natural-nonhuman rights. Does the anthropocentric dimension of our Western civilization allow us to think of natural-nonhumans as rights holders? Can the consumptive and exploitative structure of the Western model of life, which considers development as against nature, shift to a preservationist one? The emergence of the concepts of sustainable development in international law can be seen as a first step towards this end. But these notions are still focused on the well-being of the human species: sustainable development, the conservation of natural resources and wilderness for its needs are the concern of the current environmental policies. The preservation of the environment
We need an environmental ethic based on a rational theory which thinks the ways to live in harmony with our environment. Is the language of rights the appropriate one or should we shift to another one, an environmental rationale?
The first section envisages the origins of the Western conception of nature and assesses its implications in the dominant discourse of human rights. The second one explores the possibilities of a nonanthropocentric approach of nature's rights. The third part suggests 'weak anthropocentrism' as a framework that reconcile rationality and rights of nature.
The aim of this essay was to show how possible it is to gradually change the way we traditionally think the world. I considered the possibility of giving rights to nature and analysed on what grounds. I tried to justify it on a moral then on a legal basis. I finally opted for a 'weak anthropocentric' approach which does not require the abandonment of the rational framework, essential for human thought, but its adjustment from its pedestal into a rationality that considers life in harmony with nature as a fundamental value.
