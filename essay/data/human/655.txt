Judges have the important role of interpreting statutes. Sometimes there is ambiguity in a statute's meaning, either because words have several interpretations, dispute over its purpose, or the development of a new unforeseen situation not covered by the law. Literature identifies three different aids, or so-called rules of construction, the used to interpret statute: the Literal, the Golden or the Mischief Rule.
According to the Literal Rule words are given their 'plain, ordinary or literal meaning'. The Golden Rule modifies the Literal rule by seeking to avoid any absurdity. The Mischief rule on the other hand suggests a purposive approach and allows the judge to consult working papers in order to find out the mischief that the statute was intended to remedy.
However, these 'rules are merely guidelines' as there 'is no external control on the judges.' Reddish calls this the 'all powerful judiciary.'
Judges can refer to external sources, dictionaries, textbooks, earlier statutes or even working papers as aids. In recent years we can observe a slight change in the extent parliamentary material can be considered.
The famous decision of This essay provides a brief analysis of the decision and its impact on statutory interpretation to this day.
A group of teachers at an independent public school brought this case to the courts. They were only paying one fifth of the normal fees on the grounds that their children filled up places that the school was unable to fill. The tax office argued that taxes should be paid on the average cost of the benefit and that the teachers should contribute to the general costs of the school, whereas the teachers argued the tuition fee should be the tax basis, which was considerably lower.
This case was of constitutional importance as it raised the question of the permissibility of judicial reference to parliamentary debates.

Allowing judges to use Hansard as an aid to understanding statutes can be seen positively, since if it helps them implement the Legislature's purpose. It reinforces the judicial role as upholders of the law and not lawmakers.  The court held that reference to Hansard should be permissible in order to find out the actual purpose of a statute 'to give effect to some particular EC directive." In
 The European Union style of drafting legislation is different from the British style for in the former case broad principles are laid down leaving the gaps to be filled in by judges who are required to apply the spirit or purpose of the legislation. In the latter case, every detail is provided for by legislation. A fundamental change of policy had therefore to take place!'
We can see a change 'from the purely British "purist" approach to a "purposive" approach.'
