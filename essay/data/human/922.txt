The founding principle of the NHS was equity and to remove the financial burden of medical care. Despite this service, there still exists significant, differences in health and incidence of disease within the population (Moon & Gillespie 1995). These differences are known as health inequalities.
Inequalities exist as a result of unequal social position, i.e. differences in socio-economic status, geographic location, gender, age and ethnicity and are an important issue as they can have a profound effect on people's lives. It is important we work to reduce them, because as highlighted by Mackenbachal. (2002) "they contradict values of fairness and justice and reducing inequalities will lead to better average health in the population as a whole".
What can be seen from studies into health inequalities is that there is a clear class gradient. Blaine (1997) noted that "mortality rates increase in a step wise fashion as one moves from social class I (professional) to social class V (unskilled) with the mortality rate of the later being twice that of the former".
The first comprehensive report into health inequalities carried out was the Black Report; it was commissioned by the labour government in 1977 and published in 1980. It suggested four explanations of social class differences in health.
The framework for achieving this has three key roles:
