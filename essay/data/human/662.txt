A company incurs additional costs when it operates across national boundaries (e.g. the costs of complying with local regulation). Hence, there must be some offsetting advantage to the MNC to produce abroad to overcome these costs and also to have some advantage over competitors already operating in the foreign economy (as suggested by S. Hymer). Dunning's 'eclectic paradigm' (1988) gives us the O+L+I framework of why MNCs might have such an advantage.
Three broad categories explain why:
FDI can be seen under many lights, one being as the result of governments who use MNCs as strategic instruments. Evidence of this can be found during the 1990s when the Eastern European governments attracted FDI by their own MNCs while the liberalisation of markets and privatisation broke down communism. In general however, MNC subsidiary motivations can be seen as capitalist movements due to market imperfections. The drive is increasingly for global profits as MNCs are in search of more revenue (the market seekers) and lower costs (the resource seekers).
In conclusion, differences among MNCs' characteristics and dynamic environmental conditions mirror the variety of different reasons why firms set up foreign subsidiaries.
Nevertheless, a strong ability and desire of an MNC to internalise its possessed O and L advantages, matched with market imperfections and high uncertainty, creates a complete atmosphere for an MNC to set up a foreign subsidiary.
