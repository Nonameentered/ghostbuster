While the two regimes of Per Both men were elected democratically, both were ousted by illegitimate army coups, both died in office (although in radically different circumstances) and both were carried into rule and supported during government by the workers, as the power of the people asserted itself in Latin America against the oligarchs, the capitalists, the 'imperialist' foreign companies and the conservative forces of politics and the military. It was the overwhelming support of the working class that defined the two governments; Per For there is more to working class allegiance than 'natural' tendencies or alternatively submission, what needs to be addressed is how these leaders gained the devotion of the working class that they undoubtedly held, but also how there is room for agency of the working classes themselves, not simply following whatever shining light is held before them or hating the capitalist phantoms that are presented to scare them but deciding for themselves what is the problem and diagnosing the solution to it.
While traditionally it might be expected of the labouring classes to orientate towards Marxist parties, that unhelpful dogma is obviously proven wrong by the Peronist working class and many worker-supported non-socialist parties through time, and therefore a more analytical explanation of the strength of the Chilean working-class left is needed first in order to prove and account for any 'deviance' from the socio-political norm that the Argentines may be. Marxists are fond of dialectics and the establishment of a strong working class identity with a left-wing ideology in Chile has the hallmarks of a dialectical development, with the 'two parallel traditions of almost uninterrupted parliamentarism and of violence, repression and militant mass struggle' While on the one hand, the bitter struggle of Chilean workers against the establishment with the miners rebellion, the repression of Ib
The Chilean experience then, with its parallel tradition, is the formative factor in explaining the strength and the trajectory of the working class left. The experience had not been good for the poorer people of this relatively resource-rich country, and the usual suspects in all Latin American countries reared their head: dependence, inflation and repatriation of profits overseas, a scourge that led to a typical 'enemies home and abroad' rhetoric from their leaders such as Allende, who was not straying from the general current of opinion when he diagnosed the problems as being because 'Chile is a capitalist country, dependent upon imperialism and dominated by sectors of the bourgeoisie allied to foreign capital' The material hardships and perception of inequity and exploitation of the poor Chileans fostered resentment, but the outraged determination necessary for revolutionary action was kindled by the enforced impotence of workers and labour in the face of successive demonstrations and strikes that were 'cruelly repressed'
Taking a specific focus on the Yarur cotton mill, significant as the first overthrowing of factory rule in an acceleration of revolution after Allende was elected, the evidence of Chilean factors in radicalising the labourers is apparent. As with workers all over the country, labour laws enacted by the Christian Democrats and previous centre-left governments had not helped enough, the employer always finding a way to circumvent the protection laws to fire a 'disloyal' employee, or control the obviously docile company union, and getting institutionalised informers to snitch on any hint of subversive activity or thought. This system of repression had been enough to tame the 'Old-timers' who had been freshly incorporated from the countryside and were deferential, but with the arrival of the 'youngsters' came a destabilising force of militancy, a new generation of educated, motivated workers who were most importantly urban, 'where the nature of neighbouring and social interactions transmitted, reinforced and consolidated a strong sense of working-class identity and social solidarity' That close-knit identity from a shared existence mirrors the experience of the whole country's working class, where 70% of the population by 1970 were in cities This was an example of oligarchic capitalism's repression coming into contact with a burgeoning working class identity that demonstrates the dialectical process in bringing about militant revolutionary activity. However the old-fashioned dialectic explained through hardship is not sufficient as a contrasting explanation with the working class' actions in Argentina, first of all because there were hardly prosperous conditions for them either and although their sporadic efforts at activity were repressed also, there was no flourishing of revolutionary rhetoric, despite having similarly urbanised labourers with shared experiences. The interpretation of urban identity compared to rural values from Argentina, in which the recently urbanised country workers with rural criollo values supported Per However, that 'hypothetical dichotomy' Therefore a reason for the differing methods of the people in the two countries has to be sought, for although there does not need to be strict correlation for economic circumstances to be a motivation in each country, there must be analysis of how they took such diverging lines of action and support.
While in Chile, working class activists had always been pushing to unionise the labourers and agitate for collective action, making one of the strongest trade union movements on the continent, in Argentina they had never held a grip in politics nor asserted much power in the sphere of industry. Before 1946 only about 20% of the urban labour force which are the vital constituency for any working class movement were organised Whether the unions were therefore invitingly weak or whether Per There is always the possibility of the deceptively (for historians unsatisfactorily?) simple answer, that the material improvements offered by Per The revisionist analysis would state that this is not a case of advantage being taken of the working classes, but rather the working classes taking advantage of a good offer, pursuing the most logical course for their self-advancement with ideological purity being not too high of a price to pay, the hopes of other more radical agitators for working class support pre-empted as a British ambassador noted "[The] immediately tangible [labour and social] benefits with which Per However, the benefits gained by Per
Per While it may be seen as submissiveness and that 'almost all the unions cheerfully sacrificed autonomy for material self-advancement' Per Because of these sticks, and the memory, or perhaps the illusion of a carrot from the benefits he claimed for them, the working classes only effective organisation was co-opted by Per
While Per There had long been a radical tendency among the Chileans, even in 1941 the Marxist parties had got over 30% of the vote It was the Christian Democrats with their outreach programs in the Any political analysis of working class allegiance in Chile however has to temper the impression of a massive surge to the socialist left with the reminder that Allende only won with a plurality of 36.3 percent of the vote, an incredibly narrow victory over Allesandri and Tomic's 34.9 and 27.8 percent respectively That election shows that the majority of the country did not vote for Allende's program, a substantial part of even the working class wary as 'the [CDP] government [had] enjoyed widespread popularity and support among workers in urban centres and in the countryside'
Despite the exceptions and disclaimers to the idea of a universal working class allegiance however, it is clear that Allende did appeal to the workers of Chile and there was vast support for 'Chile's Road to Socialism' among the unions, neighbourhood associations, peasant leagues and youth and womens groups that sprouted in the surge of working class participation. While union membership in Chile more than doubled from 271,000 in 1964 to 551,000 in 1970 It must be accounted for with a political and social explanation, with shared urban experience, as demonstrated with the Yarur mill seizing, being a formative process, but the reason for divergence from Argentina is because the Chileans diagnosed political solutions to their socio-political repression and economic austerity, and with a considerable class consciousness applied their weight to building and supporting strong political parties that worked in their interests.
The working class of Chile may not have been instilled with left-wing tendencies from above, but they were hugely influenced by the politicians that led them along the Chilean road to socialism, and as much as any social or economic reasons they supported the Socialists because they promised brotherhood and solidarity for the working class and a society free of exploitation, because they were told that 'Chilean workers must understand that they are part of this government, that they are the government' Per
The great success of Per With the symbolic integration of the working class with the rest of society it created one people, one nation that devotedly followed its head, nationalism playing the part of unifier and fostering cultural pride in the "New Argentina". Part of this success was due to the great skills of Per Allende, while appealing in his own bespectacled way to his supporters and not a bad orator himself, was arguably more ideological and less inspirational, therefore he was more divisive (as the women of the saucepan march could attest) and did not tap into mass nationalist feeling the same way as Per
A method which the two demagogues similarly exploited was the populist appeal of a brotherhood, where the working class felt like they were sharing a common identity and the perception that they were all valued collectively by their leaders shaped their allegiance to them both. While the working class could obviously have self-improving motives for supporting Allende, Per The General argued for democracy to represent the workers as a collective, not just atomised individuals in a liberal capitalist market place exploited by 'imperialists'. That may be dismissed as simply a voice through Per Per In the same way that Allende defiantly stated 'I am not the President of the dealers and the speculators' With this combination of nationalism, oppositioning and solidarity with the working class against the elite, Per

Economic circumstances and political mobilisation may be the obvious forces that shape the allegiance of the working class, but cultural movements also defined the mood of the masses, with a growing appetite for culture matching the working classes' participation in politics, and the two were linked as the main consumer of the precious spare time the working class had. While some world-renowned literary figures held disdainful views of Per In keeping with the more earthy drive of the Chilean working class was the 'New Song' of the 60's, involving protest songs, a rejection of popular commercial music (inevitably inferior imitations of the Anglo-American pop music that dominated that decade) that had a folk connection and a romantic solidarity with the humble as best sang by Violeta Parra.
The working class were not just passive receivers of protest songs along with the Marxist dialogue of their parties in Chile, nor were the Argentines taken advantage of by a leader they had blind rapturous devotion for, there was plenty of room for working class agency in the times of Per The view of Argentine unions as a submissive labour movement that allowed Per Also, it may be questioned as to whether the labourers were taken advantage of at all, since they had gained considerable wage increases and benefits that they were in no position to demand before Per However, unfortunately for the reputation perhaps of the Argentine working class as a movement, unfairly or not they are judged by their determination to achieve a fairer redistribution of income and an improvement of their standing in society, and in that test undoubtedly they did not apply themselves, whether that be because of the working class' formative process or their organisation's experience and reaction under Per
Also pursuing material gains were the Chilean workers, but they were not shy of taking matters into their own hands even though their government (literally, according to Allende) was actually promising a redistribution of wealth, it just was not fast enough for them. The seizure of the Yarur mill was a move perhaps emboldened by the election of Allende but it was certainly not sanctioned by him, and it served to kick-start the revolution into a gear that Popular Unity was perhaps not ready for. Similarly the sprouting of Although these militant industrial belts eventually rallied around the government in the face of the reactionaries, along with the activities of MIR it demonstrates how there was no tight grip on the working class' organisations in the same way that Per In fact, even with the enforced docility of the Argentine working class activists, the literally correct diagnosis would be that the working class never has any allegiance except to itself, it may throw its weight behind a political force like Peronism or Popular Unity, and once under that regime it may fall sway to the inspiring yet unrewarding populism, or it may endeavour to fulfil the ideology in spite of the regime that shares it with them, but those are all means to an end rather than a binding loyalty.
Determining the appeal of Allende's socialist agenda to a working class is not mystifying, the only question that needs to be explained is how such a road was taken so openly and how the proletariat had such a strong class consciousness that they zealously pursued it, even to the point of taking it beyond Allende's wishes. The unique tradition of Chile in part answers both those questions, as it enabled Marxist ideas to be propagated, discussed and elected into office in a democratic fashion, and it also focused the worker's ambitions on the political sphere that drove them to participate in a way that created such a strong movement. The analysis of Argentina's working class however, has always had the feeling of a post-mortem, the American Federation of Labour's quandary about the cause of death being that 'it is not certain whether the apparent popularity of President Juan D. Per However a judgement on that issue is futile because in a tactic of carrot and stick, both elements are equally vital, a more pertinent factor to be analysed is the reason behind the relative weakness of the Argentine working class' political movement, and their unions in particular, the answers being a tradition of divided but unfocused leftists in a working class that was anaemically unionised, a stark contrast to Chile's brimming left-wing scene. Both peoples were in need of a figurehead that inspired and connected with them, although Allende depended less on populist displays for his support; both were the product of an exploitative society that wanted to be counted as a collective, although the Chileans wanted to take matters into their own hands more than the Argentines who were satisfied by oppositionist rhetoric, and both were hoping to improve their own lot independently if possible, although for the Argentines it was not.
