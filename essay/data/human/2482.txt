The main objective of this experiment will be to show the performance characteristics of a 'Rutland Wind Charger' turbine (fig.1). The turbine will be assessed under set laboratory conditions in order to produce qualitative comparisons that will determine the forms of both its Coefficient of Performance vs. Tip Speed Ratio (C Tip Speed Ratio (C We will also examine the generator characteristics represented as a graph plot of the relationship between
Discrepancies that could affect results include:
