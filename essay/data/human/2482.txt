The main objective of this experiment will be to show the performance characteristics of a 'Rutland Wind Charger' turbine (fig.1). The turbine will be assessed under set laboratory conditions in order to produce qualitative comparisons that will determine the forms of both its Coefficient of Performance vs. Tip Speed Ratio (C p-), and Torque Coefficient vs. Tip Speed Ratio (C Q-) curves plotted on a graph. We will also examine the generator characteristics represented as a graph plot of the relationship between I (current delivered to the load), and  (the rate of rotation in rpm) for constant voltages E.
Discrepancies that could affect results include:
