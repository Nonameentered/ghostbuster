To accomplish a natural-sounding intonation is often the most difficult challenge for adult learners of English. To describe the intricacies of English intonation in a clear, logical way should therefore be paramount in any notation system. Peter Roach's (1991) framework, the classical choice in most classes of English intonation in Europe, will be described in section 2 of this paper. In section 3, Roach's notation system will be compared to that of David Brazil (1994), who focuses in his work on the function of intonation. The critical analysis of advantages and disadvantages of each system put forward will concentrate on coherence and clarity as parameters for evaluation.
Both Roach and Brazil claim for their books to be practical courses. There are obvious differences in terms of the volume of issues covered and the depth of theoretical detail, but these differences are entailed by the difference in the authors' objectives. Whereas Roach aims to give a theoretical background encompassing all major areas of "English Phonetics and Phonology", Brazil's goal is to help foreign learners of English to communicate with greater proficiency. It is in the light of these objectives that the frameworks discussed in this paper and their notation systems must be evaluated.
Brazil's reduction of terminology is certainly beneficial for his very applied course, and even though some of his notation lacks coherency and system, his framework is much quicker to grasp and concentrates on the vital information. Roach's notation on the other hand is a well-balanced compromise between including more information and keeping the utterances legible. In conclusion it has to be said that both course books serve the goals stated in their introductions well, albeit Roach's notation seems to be slightly more comprehensively designed.
