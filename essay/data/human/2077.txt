1) Colony counts /g or colony forming units (cfu) /g are a better indication of colony counts rather than total viable counts /g. This is because it is sometimes not possible to be certain that each colony came from an individual colony. In this case, it is best to refer to the colonies as colony forming unit/g.
2) It was impossible to calculate the lowest level of contamination (number of bacteria per gram) of mince detected by spread plating 0.1 ml of the 10 Reasons for why the colonies were too numerous to count are explained in the discussion.
However the lowest level of contamination can be calculation on the 10
3) Advantages and disadvantages of the spread plate and pour plate methods for estimating total aerobic colony counts.
4) The factors that affect the precision of the colony count are:-
5) Coliforms are gram negative, facultative rods that ferment lactose with gas formation. The coliforms include, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter and Citrobacter.
Enterobacteriaceae is a family that contains gram negative rods, which are non motile and are facultative anaerobes and have simple nutritional requirements. The Enterobacteriaceae family can be divided into two groups, based on their formation properties. The genera in the family include Escherichia, Klebsiella and Enterobacter.
6) Presumptive counts are found on the probability or assumed number of organisms. Conformation that the colonies on the VRBGA are members of the Enterobacteriaceae is shown by pink/purple colonies with halos. The purple colonies are caused by the fermentation of lactose, which cause the bile salts in the VRBGA to precipitate out. There is also production of gas during the fermentation which displaces the LSTB Durham tube and the gas is visible as a bubble at the top of the inverted tube.
