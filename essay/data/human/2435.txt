From the outset, the aim of the project will be unrealistic and not meet customer requirements.
The members of the team must not get along functionally or socially. There must not be enough time, or any plans to recruit alternative staff should the need arise.
No time will be wasted on planning. The team will not know where to start. The plan will never be updated if the project falls behind so that it becomes unachievable, thus killing motivation.
As leader, I will endeavour to be deceitful and lazy whenever possible. I shall not make goals clear, nor reward my team for any successes.
The project cannot overrun past 20 weeks. We will compromise performance and cost if necessary to reach this deadline.
Turning the above around, the things I would do to make the project successful:
The result of the consultation may not be exactly what was required. The company will take the consultants advice, and implement a solution that is not suitable or thorough.
The consultant has manipulated the company's lack of understanding, and has not asked the company for its opinion where several options were available. This could be to save the consultant time and money. The result is that the company has a less than satisfactory outcome of the consultancy, and may not even be aware of it.
The consultant must cover all the possible outcomes of the situation... unless the customer specifically excludes some options. For this to be ensured, the customer may have to do some basic research.
The consultant may delegate certain aspects of the consultancy to inexperienced staff, who do not take all the necessary steps to ensure that the company's data remains securely looked after.
Any consultant should be aware of the importance of data protection, but may choose to ignore it.
The company should demand references from a consultant's previous customers, or only choose a consultant through recommendation. Failing these, the company should use a consultant with a reputable name.
The postal rule was created to sort a problem where different communication methods took varying lengths of time to deliver a response. However, the new technological methods introduce a couple more problems:
They are assumed to be instant communication, but any number of minor technical problems could cause a serious delay. The nature of our electronic communications networks often make it impossible to place blame for this delay.
Delivery of a message does not necessarily mean it has been read. For example, requiring a computer terminal to read email introduces the idea that a response may not reach a person out of office hours or at the weekend.
Messages such as email will pass through several servers on the way to their destination, making them far less secure than a postal letter, which will show visible signs of tampering if it has been read by any unauthorised persons.
In the future, the postal rule could mean:
Service providers must be able to guarantee, instant and secure delivery of communications.
People will be held responsible for carefully selecting the medium they choose to communicate acceptance, depending on the time, date, nature of acceptance, and recipient.
Any strategy for dealing with disruptive technology should cover these key parts:
To thoroughly analyse all potential disruptive technologies would be over the top; many technologies often fail to fulfil their expectations, and new standards form slowly over time. Therefore, the technical community must identify issues which it thinks are key to the business success in near future (e.g. the next 3 years). The number of these issues should be kept low (e.g. 5 per year). The ideas could be presented annually at a 'new technologies meeting', ensuring that all are properly documented. The long time between meetings will give technical staff time to carefully gauge the impact of a technology.
Should the same technology arise several years in a row, then it should almost certainly be given serious consideration. The company must decide on a plan of action individually for each technology, rather than stick to a regular policy, which could see the company left behind or stranded with unpopular ideas.
BT plc
According to about.com, "In most cases, the diluted earnings-per-share figure is far more accurate estimation of the total earnings per share and receive special attention when valuing a company." However, in this case, the EPS values are inconsistent with the actual events at BT.
In 2001, BT sold several services to try and reduce debts. This is reflected by the smaller turnover and employee count in 2002.
BT also cut back its dividend payouts in 2002 as another part of the debt reduction process. The gradual increase in dividends since 2002 shows that BT is now much happier with the state of its finances.
Finally, the profits seem to have settled at around 2,800, showing that the new business plan is not only profitable, but sustainable.
