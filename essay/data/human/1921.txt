Liquid samples especially water and samples which contain low numbers of microorganisms or low concentration of bacteria are suitable for multiple tube dilution method.
Pour plate is the most suitable method to examine sample with high concentration of bacteria.
Instructions:
Enterobacteriaceae from faeces may contaminate hands plus S. aureus in hands may transfer to raw products. Raw products are easily contaminated with those bacteria and so the expected bacteria presence is higher.
Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus are not heat resistant. After the food is fully cooked, most vegetative bacteria are killed but not bacterial spores, so the expected count will be lower. However, the cooked products may be put at warm temperature overnight without covered properly. There may be aerial contamination or the bacterial spores which survive cooking germinate.
Cream used to make the cream cake is pasteurised. All vegetative microbes should be killed but spores survive. Cakes are always kept in the fridge so the spore growth is inhibited and expected no count. However if the cake is left out overnight and exposed to air, aerial contamination may happen.
