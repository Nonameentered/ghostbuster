The statement is clearly true, but the majority of people fail to accept the severity of the global warming problem. It is just one way in which the advances in technology over the last century have upset the natural balance of the Earth. For the past 150 years, engineering practice has been based on controlling, rather than co-operating with, nature. Projects have gone ahead with no thought for their social, economic and environmental impact on natural systems. This has resulted in the making of a wasteworld, side by side with a technological wonderworld (6).
The apparently seamless introduction of excellent technology creates the impression that the world can provide an abundance of power and clean water. In the case of water, overuse is highlighted in the short term by drought. However, the effect of society's addiction to fossil-fuelled power is less obvious (1). For the majority, "there is still this big disconnect between switching the light on and climate change" - Tony Juniper, director of Friends of the Earth, (2).
In the last 10 years, managers have seen from experience that the social, environmental, economic, cultural and ethical aspects of a project are often more important than the technical aspects (6). This knowledge is finally filtering through to society, particularly in Europe, where the Kyoto protocol has been widely accepted. There are now clear signs that the changing environment is adversely affecting human life. Almost a fifth of all ill health in poor countries can be attributed to environmental factors including climate change and pollution, the World Bank has warned (5).
There are an increasing number of parties keen to be seen helping the environment.
Kingsmead primary school in Cheshire has been built with solar panels in the roof, heating powered by biomass, and a rainwater recovery system (4).
Sainsbury's in North Greenwich has an array of solar panels creating around 5,000 units of electricity per year (4).
Buntingsdale Infant School installed an environmentally friendly heat pump using 'green refrigerants' (4).
Several Hollywood celebrities like to be seen driving their Toyota Priuses, a car powered by a hybrid petrol-electric engine - According to The Sunday Times, Oct 23 2005.
The list goes on; the point being that the issue of pollution is a hot topic.
Although man-made technology has been the cause of many problems, it is likely to also be the solution. Many eco-friendly technologies are being developed, the clear frontrunners being recycling (which accounts for nearly a third of the waste from many European countries) (2) and wind power (which in Spain and Denmark will regularly contribute 20% of total power consumption) - For many, it is still unclear whether nuclear power is part of the problem or the solution. Several governments, including the UK, are undecided on their nuclear policy.
Not all new environmental technologies are to combat climate change. The French National Assembly has voted to ban all non-biodegradeable plastic bags by 2010. -  Most of the harmful technologies we take for granted have more eco-friendly alternative available, but many never reach commercial application because due to lack of funding, or an unhelpful market -
If there is to be radical change, it will have to stem mainly from government policy. In many countries there are schemes and subsidies for research and implementation of eco-friendly technologies, but some (namely the US) are still refuting the need for action. Industry has become a cornerstone of economic stability or economic growth, thus all countries fear a reduction in industrial output. "The truth is no country is going to cut its growth of consumption in the light of a long-term environmental problem" - Tony Blair, at the Clinton Global Initiative, New York in September.
However, government policy alone will not save the world. A great deal depends on the next two generation of engineers, having the environmental understanding and the will to start doing things differently. The universities that take this on board sooner rather than later will no doubt be rewarded in the future.

Articles discussing the social, political and environmental effects of climate change and other problems caused by an energy-hungry society:
The stabilisation of the Earth's environment is going to rely on action in the short, medium and long term. The Kyoto agreement, and the EU's greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme have been brought into place to encourage immediate action and short term change. Many expect these short term targets to be met by introducing more wind power and nuclear power. In the medium term, switching back to biomass/biogas may help to make our carbon production more sustainable. In the long term, hydrogen is being hailed as the fuel of the future. The burning of hydrogen creates zero emissions, and if implemented well, can use similar production and distribution to biogas. Recycling is an available resource which needs to be exploited far more, and there lies the real challenge - waking society to the scale of the problem, and instilling in people the will to change our lifestyles so that we can live in harmony with nature.
