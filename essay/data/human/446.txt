After the evacuation of the 'Callejeros' concert on the night of the 30 The alarming eventual death toll of one hundred and ninety-one spectators has been attributed to a series of cavalier omissions and actions by the aforementioned owner of Rep Witnesses testified to the owner's litany of malpractices and liability for the numerous deaths from inhalation of toxic smoke. Chab Writing in an article for 'Debate' magazine in the proceeding week, the journalist Mempo Giardinelli enunciated that, given the recent issuing of fire safety certification, an incident of bribery or gross negligence had patently occurred somewhere in the chain of authority.
Incidents such as that of Rep Owing to chronic mismanagement exemplified by Chab Awareness of the absence of controls to inhibit resulting safety omissions frequently incites public scepticism over governmental capacity to proffer effective protection. Erstwhile examples of such laxity include the deaths of 464 people in a 2004 Paraguayan supermarket fire, Alvarez's emphatic proclamation that "El Estado no cumpli Furthermore, the absence of any differentiation between state and local government in the official's comments suggested government culpability at a national level. With antipathy building in the days following, Ibarra himself became the principal target of a series of street demonstrations, usurping Chab
Incited by this collective chagrin, a revealing consequence of the tragedy was the extent and speed with which social protests were organised in the name of garnering justice for the victims. Driven by the belief that corruption was to blame, within two days a group of 600 people, largely composed of friends and family members of those killed, had congregated and marched towards the city's main square, 'La Plaza de Mayo', to protest their demands outside the presidential building. As the journalist Jos The presence and role of direct democracy in contemporary Argentine society is arguably attributable to a legacy of arduous social conditions. Endurance of a repressive military dictatorship through 1966 to 1983, and equally the economic instability of the superseding democratic tenures of Presidents Ra Particularly prominent in quotidian city life are the actions of organisations such as the 'Madres del Plaza de Mayo', and those of the multitudinous 'Piquetero' groups originating from the poor outer districts. The tumultuous Piquetero campaigns in particular lead to the regular blockading of city sites and streets in an endeavour to draw attention to their causes. While such an approach receives the frequent derision of the more affluent, street protesting has not been purely a pursuit of the city's lower demographics, considering the disaffected middle class's hands-on response to President Fernando de la R
Principally as a consequence of ongoing protests from Piquetero groups, the significance of the recent tragedy swiftly altered. Protest over redress for a chronic local security omission became blurred with enduring antipathy for the government at a national level. Whilst figures such as President Kirchner and the Callejeros themselves spoke of not wishing to see the tragedy manipulated for political ends, As a report featured in Clar In the same vein, within a few days the club's location at 'Plaza Miserere' came to feature a substantial quantity of paraphernalia conveying a recurring anti-authority theme, dominating that which was initially placed to express condolences and lament for the loss of life.
Taking into account the press's observation that there had been a degree of hijacking of the third march, such action in the wake of the disaster can be regarded as opportunistic, and the profound negativity toward authority need not necessarily be regarded as reflective of that felt by the city's public as a whole. Nonetheless, the hostility imbedded in the protests did see palpable alignment with scepticism expressed by other segments of Porte A survey of the opinions of its readership published by Clar Almost an equal percentage of those questioned from the city and the Buenos Aires province regarded Ibarra and Chab Whilst the scope of the survey was potentially rather small-scale and limited given its collation of the responses of fewer than one thousand people, Clar Though it would be inaccurate to regard Porte
Indeed, the validity of this ill-feeling towards the political system was arguably well-supported by the events of the days proceeding the fire. Relatives of the victims were vociferous in their criticism of President Kircher's protracted five day silence on the matter, regarded by many as a calculated move intended to maintain his distance Ibarra was incidentally decidedly fortunate to avoid any appraisal of his role and latent culpability in the tragedy; his diminished political power clearly observable in evading a hearing by a mere three votes. In the wake of the disaster, events seemingly continued to demonstrate the malaise of democracy and the illegitimacy of the nation's government, precipitating a city-wide sense of crisis and advancing the credulity of sustained political decay.
Analysts in the media opted to emphasise the theme of political impunity and gubernatorial infirmity even further, echoing and articulating the interpretation of local corruption as a microcosm of the nation as a whole. The writer Mempo Giardinelli, for example, expressed the disaster as "el resultado de a A counterpart of Giardinelli's, Luis Tonelli, was less histrionic in tone though noticeably in accord with conclusions over the failure to eradicate corruption. Tonelli conversely warned against the pervasive diffusion of an anti-authority mindset, insisting that the incident, rather than demonstrating the exigency of a further downsizing of administrative power, elucidated the need for a legitimate, effective authority to protect against future episodes. Despite the disagreements of the two writers, the respective focuses of their articles emphasised the profound sense of crisis plaguing Buenos Aires society in the wake of the Rep Distrust of the authorities had palpably resurged, the incident suggesting the persistence of endemic corruption, and owing to the apparent impunity granted to those cited as culpable, the enduring decay of a system unable to effectively protect and represent those it serves.
In the wake of the Rep Catalysed by awareness of corruption, numerous organised protests were held as aggrieved families and relatives sought an explanation for the fire's outbreak and punishment of those culpable. Parallels drawn by the press with the 'Kheyvis' tragedy of 1993 compounded convictions that city security development remained stagnant and ill-equipped to oversee the protection of its citizens. Politicians appeared avid to distance themselves from the issue, with President Kirchner maintaining an interminable silence and the city's Mayor An Though protestors' demands for retribution were subsequently absorbed to advance the ongoing causes of Piquetero groups, a degree of consensus over the incident's significance emerged between the city's social demographics. Despite parliament's responding fiercely to criticise those involved, events such as Ibarra's aversion of an interpellation effectively served to affirm a sense of the inviolate status enjoyed by those in control. Spurred by the interpretation that the tragedy's circumstances evidenced the permanence of corruption and political impunity at a national level, Rep Analytical sections of the media portrayed the tragedy as indicative of the nation's continuing political decay, and in the abuse of power it elucidated essentially akin to the governance presided over by the antecedent military dictatorship. In advance of a localised example of negligent security, the Rep
