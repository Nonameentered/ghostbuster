Mr Mr
Based on the acute symptoms Mr
Physical examination will look for signs of neurological deficits, including upper motor neuron signs of hypertonia, hyperreflexia, babinski reflex, rigidity and lower motor neuron signs of hypotonia, hyporeflexia, loss of power in muscles and muscle fasciculations. Sensation and signs of hemiparesis will also be assessed in the upper and lower limbs.
A cranial nerve examination will be performed assessing each cranial nerve I-XII, with particular attention to any possible visual field defects and assessment of the gag reflex (CNXII) for assessment of a brainstem stroke.
On general examination, Mr There were no signs of clubbing, cyanosis, lymphadenopathy, jaundice or anaemia. Capillary refill was <2 seconds.
History and examination confirm the initial possible causes of Mr Mr The signs on examination supporting the diagnosis of stroke are the unilateral left-sided facial palsy and the slight weakness of the left upper and lower limbs.
By the He remained confused but the improvement of his weakness over 6 days indicates that he had a mild stroke. The most likely cause of this stroke is an ischaemic event.
 His left-sided weakness limited his ability to stand, which he cannot do unaided since his collapse. Mr During his stay in hospital Mr Mr With physiotherapy it is hoped that his left-sided weakness will improve further.

Stroke represents the third most common cause of death in the UK and developed countries, accounting for 12% of all UK deaths (1). The incidence increases exponentially with age, rising from about 3 per 10,000 in the third and fourth decades to about 300 per 10,000 in the eighth and ninth. Total prevalence is estimated at 5-8 per 1,000 over the age of 25 years. About 16% of all women and about 8% of all men are likely to die of a stroke (2). The cumulative risk of recurrence of a stroke is high; between a third and half of survivors are likely to experience a second stroke within 5 years (2). Stroke is the third biggest cause of death in the UK and the largest single cause of severe disability. Each year more than 110,000 people in England will suffer from a stroke which costs the NHS over The Department of Health recognised the importance of developing better stroke services by including specific milestones, targets and actions in the National Service Framework (NSF) for Older People launched in March 2001. Following on from this, the Government has announced an 18 month work programme to produce a National Strategy to modernise service provision and deliver the newest treatments for stroke. By 2010 the Government aims to reduce the death rate from Stroke, CHD and related diseases in people under 75 by at least 40%.
The clinical features of a patient presenting with a suspected stroke can help indicate the area of the brain that has been affected. In strokes involving an infarction, focal brain damage may reflect the distribution of the affected artery, but sometimes collateral supplies make the diagnosis of the lesion site, based on the clinical features, more difficult. Using the Bamford classification of strokes, infarctions can be divided into four classes: total anterior circulatory (TACI), partial anterior circulatory (PACI), lacunar (LACI) and posterior circulatory (POCI) infarcts (3).
Important issues raised in this case include the level of care required when Mr It is important to take into account how his confusion may lead to his physical progress being slow because he may be unable to comprehend what he needs to do. His confusion may settle when he is at home again and in his own surroundings. Health care delivery should include advice and help to his wife and family about MR Including them in making his care plans helps them to understand the level of care Mr
