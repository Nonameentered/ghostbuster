This report is concerned with the design of discrete controllers, and the comparison of theoretical to simulated controllers. A basic First Order Plus Dead Time (FOPDT) system was selected to be controlled and various preliminary calculations were carried out to determine suitable values for system controller coefficients. Using these values, a proportional-only discrete controller, a PID discrete controller and a Dahlin controller were designed theoretically to control the system. These controllers were then simulated using the SDS simulator available at It was noted that in general the outputs produced using the simulator matched well with what was expected from the theoretically calculated values. It was also noted that the Dahlin controller performed better overall than the PID discrete controller or the proportional only discrete controller, as it reached the correct final value very quickly and had no overshoot from this value.
