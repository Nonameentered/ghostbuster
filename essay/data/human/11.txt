In negotiating the post-war political landscape of Eastern Europe, the western powers revealed an ambiguous attitude. Although historians still disagree on whether diplomatic misunderstandings between the allies of the east and west eventually caused the emergence of a cold war, or whether a gradual loss of influence in Eastern European countries was the reason for its outbreak, As former Polish Prime Minister in exile Miko
Nonetheless, the United States had full intentions to prevent the re-emergence of any great power on the European continent. Whereas the Soviets mistrusted Anglo-American intentions, Roosevelt believed until the end in the possibility of a peaceful settlement with regard to Soviet claims to "national security" in Eastern Europe. Optimistically, he believed in the compatibility of free and democratic elections in the Soviet Union's neighbouring states, and the natural emergence of 'governments which would maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union'.
Britain, too, found itself in a difficult moral position between its mid-war pledges to the Polish government that '"His Majesty's Government do not recognize any territorial changes which have been effected in Poland since August, 1939"', Miko
Despite the apparently systematic usurpation of power in Eastern European countries by the Soviet Union, it must be borne in mind that Stalin hardly foresaw the full course of events. Often, he acted upon situations as he was confronted with them. It has, therefore, been argued that 'Stalinisation was a process, not a plan'. Hence, when the Nazis, in 1943, unveiled a mass grave of 15,000 Polish officers at Katyn, murdered upon Stalin's orders, he denied all allegation and seized the opportunity to break diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile upon inquiries from President Sikorski. Moreover, the Soviet-sponsored Polish provisional government in Lublin was ordered to break its links with the loyalist Polish underground Home Army (AK).
Acting from a conviction that any liberated territory immediately became of concern solely for the liberating nation,
Stalin's interpretation of 'governmental authorities broadly representative of all democratic elements' Toward the end of the war, Moscow, defying the "London Poles", backed the establishment of a new interim government,
In the middle of 1944, however, the Lublin claims to governmental supremacy went by no means uncontested. The loyalist Home Army was still Poland's largest organised resistance movement, and Stalin, uncertain about the Lublin committee's loyalty, made a separate agreement with another Polish communist faction based in Moscow, the Polish Committee of National Liberation, which he, according to Miko
With the crushing of 'the leadership of the historic political forces and their military infrastructure' In March 1945 the Soviet Union signed a treaty of friendship with Lublin Committee;
These developments were signs of the establishment of a Polish interim government existing solely by the grace of the Soviet Union. At this time, however, Poland was still by no means a neatly communised, country, nor was it accepted to be so by the western powers. The post-war political programmes of the Lublin committee and the Polish Committee of National Liberation still revealed rather divergent political agendas. The return to Poland of Miko Even by 1946, Miko
Up to this point, we have primarily looked at the situation in Poland, which, for many western politicians, had become 'the test case of Soviet intentions'. As has been pointed out, in discussions following up on these divisions, British and Soviet foreign ministers Eden and Molotov were unable to reach an eventual agreement which satisfied both demands. In March 1945, an acting regency was agreed, consisting of 'three members, one Croat, one Serb, and one Slovene [who], though non-communists, were all nominees of Tito'. With the help of the Red Army, they 'dispersed, disarmed, or forced the exodus of Mihailovi Moreover, 'the communists, though they might share government [in a coalition], would not share power'. The Red Army had retreated from Yugoslavian territory, and Tito, though deferential to Stalin, 'had formed views of his own and had no hesitation in expressing them, even when they contradicted those of Stalin himself'.
The postwar Czechoslovak dealings with the Soviet Union were quite different. Although it has been argued that 'Stalin as well as Roosevelt and Churchill miscalculated when they assumed that there could be He 'spoke openly of a "Czech solution" that would exchange internal autonomy for Soviet control over foreign and military policy'. Although Churchill had repeatedly argued for a speeded advance eastwards beyond the western zone of occupation to liberate Prague and prevent Czechoslovakia from falling within the Soviet sphere of influence, general Eisenhower declined, arguing that he 'refused to risk casualties for 'purely political reasons''.
This policy turned out to be only one of buying time. Despite the relative moderateness and tolerance of Gottwald's communists, the Soviet Union continued to press for further advances to communisation.
The various examples of Eastern European reveal a diverse range of political situations in the period running up to May 1945. In the Polish case, Stalin's hopes for a post-war accommodation with the Sikorski government were abandoned already in 1942, The Yugoslavian situation was yet different, with a political climate in which the communist party directly and almost naturally dominated the new government. Nonetheless, Tito's power of government was not immediately and unconditionally recognised by Moscow,
Meanwhile, goodwill for Soviet intentions in the west gradually deteriorated until the alliance eventually collapsed. A turning point in Soviet diplomacy directed toward the west can be noted around March and April 1945,
May 1945 saw the beginnings of a realisation that Soviet unilateral activities in Eastern Europe had to be confronted. However, whilst Stalin had already been active with his communisation plans as territories were being liberated, the Truman administration still resisted the harsher anti-Soviet line held by the British around May 1945. The late recognition and reluctance to take responsibility of the Americans may thus have been the deciding factor in the eventual communisation of the countries in Eastern Europe.
