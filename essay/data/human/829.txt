He is being treated with an anti-emetic, an immunosuppressant and a selective-serotonin receptor inhibitor (anti-depressant). Despite all treatments,

 Fluid in the pleural space, this can be exudate in origin, which is mostly due to increased leakiness of pleural capillaries secondary to infection, inflammation or malignancy. This can be caused by pneumonia, TB, pulmonary infarction or malignant metastases. The symptoms of pleural effusions dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain or it can be
Bronchial carcinoma. The symptoms of which include
Pulmonary tuberculosis. This can be silent or cause a
Pulmonary Embolus. CLL results in polycythaemia (high white cell count) which causes a hypercoagulable state. This predisposes to pulmonary embolus and hence shortness of breath.
Recurrent pneumonia.
On physical examination I will look for signs of a fever (tachycardia, sweating, confusion), cyanosis, tachypnoea, hypotension, signs of consolidation (diminished expansion, dull percussion note, increased tactile vocal fremitus, bronchial breathing) and a pleural rub.
On general examination, There were no signs of jaundice, clubbing, cyanosis, oedema or lymphadenopathy.
 He has had regular courses of augmentin and is continuing to suffer with infection. Despite medical therapy,
At this stage it is important to investigate
 However, since his diagnosis, he says he has been finding it progressively more difficult to carry out the tasks and jobs he used to manage and is relying on the help of his partner to help him. Associated with his increased breathlessness is his constant feeling of lethargy as a result of his CLL. Over the last year He is now unable to walk more than 100 yards without getting breathless.
 He has limited contacts with others because he finds it difficult to go out when he is feeling so tired and breathless.
 His bloods are being continuously monitored and his breathlessness has reduced, with his presenting symptoms being stabilised with intravenous antibiotics. As at the
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a form of leukaemia in which there is an excess number of mature but poorly functioning lymphocytes in the circulating blood. The excess number of lymphocytes (in CLL B-cells are affected) is primarily due to the failure of lymphocytes to die at the end of their normal lifespan.
CLL is more often a disease of later life and makes up 40% of all leukaemias in patients over 65 years (1). The overall incidence is about 3/100,000 per year, with a median age of onset of 65 to 70 years (1). In black and white populations the incidence is approximately equal but in Asian populations the condition is rare. The majority of all new cases of CLL (70-80%) are chance findings on a blood test and about 40-60% of patients are symptom-free at the time they are diagnosed. Many cases are also found on the presentation of an enlarged lymph node during a routine check-up. The most common symptoms in those patients who have symptoms at the time of diagnosis include weakness, fatigue, night sweats or proneness to repeated infections. On examination, such patients may have enlarged, non-tender lymph nodes, an enlarged live and/or spleen. Anaemia is present in about 15% of patients as well as the presence of a low platelet count, indicating that the disease has affected the normal production of blood cells in the bone marrow or that there has been auto-immune damage to the red cells or platelets.
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is not considered a medical emergency unlike acute leukaemia and if it is diagnosed early treatment does not usually start immediately. Diagnosis of CLL is made on a lymphocyte count of at least 5x109/L and immunophenotyping, along with other features of CLL present. New developments in the prognosis of CLL include the use of detecting a rearrangement (mutation) of certain genes (immunoglobulin genes) but the laboratory tests required for diagnosis by this method are not available in most hospital setting. Other tests that can be used in the hospital setting include markers on the surface of CLL cells, associating their levels with the disease outcome but the importance of such tests remains in largely unknown.
Currently there is no curative treatment for CLL but most patients remain well for a long time and have a long survival. The three basic elements of treatment are:
The main drugs used in CLL treatment includes; Alkylating agents (commonly used Chlorambucil), Anthracyclines, Purine analogues (fludarabine and cladribine; preventing the formation of DNA therefore preventing cell division), Monoclonal antibodies (rituximab; an antibody binding specifically to an antigen in lymphocytes, which helps kill the cell with the help of the body's immune system) and Steroids (only in patients with advanced disease or to control auto-immune complications).
Management of CLL depends largely on the signs and symptoms of each individual. Having received the diagnosis of CLL, patients are regularly followed up by their general practitioner and following the Department of Health guidelines, individuals are referred for specialist investigations when:
A high white count with excessive numbers of lymphocytes (particularly in the presence of anaemia or low platelet count)
Presence of enlarged spleen, liver or lymph nodes
Symptomatic disease, i.e. weight loss of over 10% in the last 6 months, fewer over 38oC for 2 or more weeks and extreme fatigue or night sweats.
When CLL patients do require treatment, there will be few occasions when they would require in-patient treatment. Generally, a patient will require in-patient treatment only if they develop a severe infection. If an individual has no significant symptoms at the time of diagnosis, they will attend regular check-ups without going on medication. Currently there is no conclusive evidence that suggests early treatment prolongs survival. The criteria for beginning therapy are:
In summary, CLL is a form of cancer affecting blood producing cells in the bone marrow, with increasing incidence as you get older. The majority of patients have a slowly progressing disease with a survival of 10 years or more. CLL is not considered curable and indeed patients are not treated until they become symptomatic or when blood results indicate that the disease is progressing. The mainstay of treatment is chemotherapy, usually taken orally, and the majority of patients continue to have a good quality of life for many years. Areas of development currently are ways in which to diagnose CLL and how this may correlate to disease progression.
