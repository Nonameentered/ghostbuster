Blocks-World Management that is playing a far vital role in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to be constructed in this project. The management should be an interface between user and blocks-world so that all the commands from user can cause the specified actions among the elements of blocks-world. Some AI concept should be involved into the operation of making structure and search method. In this report two methods are implemented in C++ to establish blocks-world management, one is trying to build a dynamic blocks world and operate objects in it and the other focuses on the search method for some specified blocks world. Unfortunately, so far, this search method can not be successfully combined into the blocks world management programming, but the research work associated with the effort on them are illustrated in this report
In this project, some AI concepts are applied in a practical AI planning topic. Breadth first search method and depth first search method are utilized in this project, though part of them are not very successful so far.
