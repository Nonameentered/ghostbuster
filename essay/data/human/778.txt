In the first investigation on a dc machine, we find that there is a non linear inverse relationship between line voltage vs line current and speed vs line current in both shunt and compound generators. As requested, we use a fitting line to measure the gradient and thus find out the EMF constant for the shunt generator.
In our induction motor investigation, we have managed to use our results from no-load and locked rotor test to work out values for the equivalent simplified circuit parameters.
Finally in our synchronous generator investigation, we have drawn a graph (see appendix 6) which describes a quadratic logarithmic decay function between field excitation current and output voltage. It simply means they have a non linear positive relationship, which the output voltage increases at a slowing rate as field excitation current increases. In synchronous motor, at synchronous speed Cos Beyond that point, we can see the power factor slowly increases and approaches zero again.
This laboratory investigation aims to provide an insight to the fundamentals of different electrical machines introduced in the module (such as operation of a shunt dc generator, an induction motor and a synchronous machine). This report presents basic technical information of each machine, followed by analysis of numerical data collected in the laboratory session in week 15. Using the experiment data, conclusion can then be drawn.
