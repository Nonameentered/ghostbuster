There are many factors that affect the geometries of transition metal complexes, including thes relative energies of the metal's d orbitals, the number of d electrons the metal has, the oxidation state of the metal and the size of both the ligands and the metal. In this experiment, three d
There are two possible co-ordinations for four co-ordinate complexes: square planar and tetrahedral. The crystal field splitting diagrams for these two geometries are shown below filled with 8 d electrons as in the complexes in this experiment:
As these diagrams show, the square planar geometry is often more favourable for d However, the terahedral geometry is sterically much more favourable, because the bond angle in this case is 109, compared with 90 for the square planar geometry. Steric factors are much more important when considering first row transition metals, because the metals are much smaller, so the repulsion between the electrons in metal-ligand bonds will be increased. This means that bulky ligands will usually force the complex to adopt a tetrahedral geometry.
The energy difference between the e and t The magnitude of
The magnetic moments of the complexes synthesised in this experiment (see in table 1) indicate that CoCl(PPh This means that CoCl(PPh
From this it is clear that steric factors out weigh the benefits of the low energy square planar configuration in the case of the CoCl(PPh Conversely the Ni(NCS)
Geometric and linkage isomerism are possible for this complex:
The co-ordination of the (NCS) ligand can be determined with the infrared spectrum of this complex (figure 3). If the ligand co-ordinates to the metal atom via the sulphur atom, the stretching of the CS bond appears at 700cm If the ligand co-ordinates to the metal via the nitrogen atom, however, these stretching frequencies are different; approximately 800cm In figure 3 the absorbances at 2084 and 692cm
As there are only two absorption bands for each of these bonds, I expect that the complex adbots a trans geometry. This is because on the asymmetric stretch for a For a This is consistent with steric arguments, as the This means that the Ni(NCS)
