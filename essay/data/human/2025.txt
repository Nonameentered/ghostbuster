The aim of the practical was to illustrate and give practical learning on the principles involved in the production of clarified fruit of vegetable juice.
Another objective was to determine and compare the effectiveness of different clarifying agents on haze control.
Fruit juices have become a quick and convenient way for many people to obtain at least one of their five portions of fruit and vegetables every day.
It is therefore important that very high quality and safe products are formed. High quality referring to both the sensory characteristics, as well as the nutritional value.
In this practical we prepared and considered apple juice, orange squash, grapefruit and lemon juice.
The cloudy nature of juices is due to the presence of collected cell tissues and constituents. Most of these are colloidal and are removed from solution by destroying or hydrolyzing the pectin e.g. using pectin enzyme pectolase. This allowed for the finely divided, insoluble particles (cloud) to settle out, leaving a clear juice. (Pectin stabilizes other components and its presence causes haze or browning.)
Later attempts were made to stabilise the pectin. Pasteurisation stabilises the pectin but not for very long as was observed in the control.
The most effective clarifier was Pectic enzyme which was the 'clearest' juice after 1 week.
Gelatin was correspondingly best clarifier in terms of its ability to precipitate polyphenols which prevents the formation of brown insoluble compounds and off-flavours during storage. However, the enzyme and other clarifiers were not tested together.
It can however be deduced from the tests carried out that a combination of Pectic enzyme and 4% gelatine solution would yield the best quality product.
