"Traditional" implies longevity= first clue: these sports were pursued over many centuries
Key principle= variety
Most involved animals
Often played as part of festivals/ annual holidays
Lot of forms of football and athleticism. Most developed, however, was cricket.
All sports were disorderly and riotous and often violent
Has been suggested that by the 2
1851, only minority of males in factories whose working hours increased
Even factory workers could still play football- e.g. 1835, Blairdrummond estates vs. Deadston cotton mills
SOME validity
Wider acceptance of Enlightenment, Evangelical and Methodist values repugnant to unnecessary violence and cruelty meant that animal blood sports and other disruptive past times did decline (growing desire for respectability)
BUT Pre-occupation with "brutal" sports
More detailed analysis shows that the only working-class sports that definitely declined were blood sports involving animals- even these survived more than was presumed. E.g. badger- baiting and cock- fighting in London during 1
Re. other working- class sports: evidence suggests growth or, at least, stability
E.g. sculling/ rowing- lots of participants, prize fighting- no decline until the 1840s, Scottish curling clubs increased, athletics soared 1750- 1860, potshare, bowling, wrestling.
Horseracing, cricket and football survived outside the elite private school more extensively than assumed
Establishment of

E.g. no one succeeded in stopping much street football until the 1850s or 1860s
E.g. 2. The street football at Derby and Newark-on-Trent was only stopped in the late 1840s by the army and special constables
Widespread
DID reduce support of animal blood sports BUT continued to support other sports- boat racing, cricket, curling, etc.
Even if was a decline, patronage may have been filled by other groups- e.g. publicans
