Iron is the most abundant metal on Earth and is essential to the human bodies. It is also a typical The aim of this experiment is to determine the iron percentage in iron tablets, as a dietary supplement with Fe
(ii)
The manganate(VII) ion oxidises iron(II) to iron(III) ion.
2 Fe tablets were weighed accurately. The mass recorded.
The tablets were transferred and grinded by a pestle and mortar with a little

A rough and further titrations were carried out, until consistent results (Table 1) were obtained - results for 2 titrations agree to within 0.05cm
At first, the Fe solution turned colourless as it reacts. The end point was the first trace of permanent pink in the solution showing a tiny excess of manganate(VII) ions.
Tightnesses of the burettes taps vary: the tighter the tip, the slower the run down, the more time consuming of the practical, vice versa.
The methodology and apparatus used show a fairly high degree of accuracy (with difference of results within
The main source of error is probably the personal judgement with naked eyes of On the other hand, the consistency of pink colour can be obtained quantitatively by measuring absorbencies of solution in the conical flask after each titration. An accurate photospectrometer set at an appropriate wavelength can be used. It is expected that the higher the absorbance value the higher the pink intensity, thus a positive correlation.
The second major source of error could be After transfers, the wet surfaces of containers sufficiently mean some loss of iron. Ideally, the number of transfers and apparatus should be kept at minimum. The mortar can be used in weighing as well as grinding iron tablets. The number of transfers is therefore reduced by not using a weighing boat. It is however good to have rinsed the apparatus after transfers.
It is preferred to vortex the solution of Fe and H A shaking time could also be set. It is important to keep the consistency: A clean dry conical flask should be used for each titration. It is crucial to keep the burette straight, parallel to the clamp stand and perpendicular to the bench, when reading the burette volumes. A piece of white paper can be cut and placed behind the burette of dark purple KMnO
The Fe tablets are weighed It is good laboratory practice to have rinsed the weighing boat, pestle, mortar and the funnel after each transfer, and then the washings were added to the flask. Other accurate apparatus is used e.g. 100cm
From 2.4 Calculations and 2.5 Questions (p. 4 & 5), the percentage of iron in iron(II) Sulphate tablets has been estimated as16.3%, which is approximately half of the claimed content (32.5%) by the manufacturer. This practical has helped to further familiarised with the titration techniques.
