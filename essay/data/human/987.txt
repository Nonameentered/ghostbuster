Druker Indeed, entrepreneurs are fundamentally marketer and must be able to innovate within, where more successful entrepreneurs are more acute in managing organizational changes, necessary to absorb the transactions. Furthermore, when faced with an opportunity, an entrepreneur must be able to access and gain relevant resources and then co-ordinate and configure them in a particularly appropriate way so that collectively they deliver value in a unique and inimitable manner Another important aspect is that entrepreneurs must discover and exploit the opportunities that are not being used and it is through competitive advantage that the firm attempts to exploit these opportunities. Thus, even though, the entrepreneurial venture is built from innovative combinations of financial, operating and human resources However, it must be remembered that the effect of the network are not unequivocally positive, where "its incidence and value seem to depend on the size, type, and developmental stage of the firm in question as well as on its competitive strategy."
Finance is the most liquid and most flexible resources and entrepreneurs must make a decision, "how liquid the business is to be, how much flexibility it must have to meet short-term and unexpected financial commitments". However, it seems that finance is more advantageous to a large firm, since small firms find it hard to find appropriate sources of funding for them.
The main reasons are following
Small businesses are not a good risk
A significant proportion of small businesses do fail soon after start-up due to the failure to provide return to supplies of business finance. For example, small firms are unable to gain an access to loan term loans because of the "automatically higher risk associated with firms that have little equity in the form of share capital"
New small businesses do not have a track record, where they seem unreliable.
New business with no trading history and often with untried management, it is hard to provide satisfactory evident to potential investors with the returns they seek.
Small businesses lack security for loans.
Firms that are able to receive capital-for equity exchange, which will allow firms to circumvent the constraint imposed by short-term debt funding, are those that attract external equity, those that have grown or exhibit obvious potential for growth. However, often small businesses lack security for loans, having few or no significant reliable assets in the business. Moreover, start-up firms and small businesses faced difficulties in accessing the debt finance they required and as Macmillan report suggests, small businesses find it difficult to obtain modest amount of private equity finance regardless of desire and strategic stance Thus, often for start-up firms, finance comes from own savings or resources of family and friends, which rely heavily on the network of the entrepreneur. Indeed, many entrepreneurs use the network extensively in the 'opportunity discovery phase', where as Van de Ven Garud (1989) argued; it provides Productive Labor and financing information.
It has been suggested that the bank is the most important source of external finance. For a bank,"financial credit history and financial projections in the business plan are more important factors in risk assessment than human capital factors" However, by including an experienced entrepreneur as a part-time director in early-stage development, a firm can gain credibility and trust since this will provide access to their extensive network of contacts. Even for raising bank finance can involve a search procedure and time to find sufficient bank finance, and the best terms and conditions Thus, it can be argued that the network is a kind of glue, which holds a business community together while allowing entrepreneurs to enlarge their span of actions, gain access to resources and opportunities otherwise unavailable and avoid obstacles For example, Massachusetts also had important networks, through venture capitalists and through integration with the MIT, which provided an important spin-out rout for technology based high-value start ups.
As Starr and MacMillan suggest, since new firms usually have few employees and possess only limited resources, intensive networking is able to improve their access to information, capital, personnel, raw materials or merchandise, customers, and facilities, and may provide the trappings of legitimacy Marketing is one of the aspects of information, which is not only important to start-up businesses but rely heavily on relationships and networks. Even though it can be argued that small firms have lack of cash to spend on conventional tools of marketing such as promotion and advertisement, they establish 'relationship marketing', where firms are able to establish,
Close relationship with customer, where benefits are
As Guerrilla's manifesto suggests, in order to sell a product or a service, a company must establish a relationship with the consumer. It must build trust and rapport by understanding the customer's needs and it must provide a product that delivers the promised benefit.
Close relationship with suppliers, where benefits are
Indeed, as recent study of small manufacturing firms show that "small firms consistently rank established long-term relationships and frequency of contacts as key factors stimulating collaboration" As reported by Birley(1985), among the contacts, "business contacts were more helpful than family and friends in gaining access to raw materials or supplies, business equipment, locations, employees and sales, whereas family and friends were the primary sources of capital"
Network also provides preparation that is necessary for finding the right management team with complementary skills, where it provides potential advantages of economics of scope. What a single firm cannot afford such as loan finance or secure when operating independently, can be achieved if operate as a part of group. External linkage is also able to fuel innovation, where Specialists Networks create more of the sparks that fuel innovation and generate synergies that power them to greater competitiveness Moreover, it has been argued that new value (unexploited opportunities or possibilities) can be created if the entrepreneur can supply the innovation effectively and profitability
However, one must not neglect the fact that curvilinear relationships point can lead to the danger of over reliance on acquiring certain resources through networks,
Even though it could be argued that the network can inhibit entrepreneur behaviour by being over socialized and over embedded, network is rapidly growing area of interest because it emphasizes relationships and knowledge. Thus, network plainly has practical connotations for individuals, where different resource-providing networks may play critical roles depending on the dictates of a venture's strategy Non the less, a firm's networking has been interpreted as "the consequence of strategic decisions, concerning targeted markets and the resources needed to compete in them" Financial, or informational; whether owned or temporarily controlled, derives from its utility in discovering and exploiting opportunities and it is through these opportunities that a firm will be able to establish a competitive strategy, which can be gained more easily through the network than the finance.
