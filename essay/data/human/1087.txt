13C CP MAS, 1H DQ MAS and 1H CRAMPS solid-state NMR spectroscopy were used in conjunction with solution-state NMR and crystal structure analyses to investigate weak intermolecular C-H Changes to 13C and 1H chemical shifts and proton proximity data strengthened the proposal of weak hydrogen bonding between the samples in both cases, as implied by the crystal structure data. The observed results add credence to the argument that weak hydrogen bonding plays as essential role in the self assembly of molecules in supramolecular crystalline structures.
The role of the weak C-H The distances and angles given in the supramolecular structure of uracil are comparable to the stronger N-H Also, the flexibility of the ranges of these geometrical parameters makes the weaker hydrogen bonds even more likely to influence crystal engineering. Equilibrium crystal structure arrangements are such a precise balance of many molecular interactions that it is extremely unlikely for such an importance influence as the hydrogen bond to cease acting at well defined distances and electronegativities.
Some of the NMR data presented in this investigation proved slightly weaker than expected in detecting these hydrogen bonds due to interference from other interactions caused by the sensitivity of the technique. To add to this, poor resolution of Of course ever present and all important when considering NMR chemical shifts is errors of calibration and reference of spectra, particularly when used as solitary evidence.
However, this emphasises another key factor to such an investigation; that the best possible results were obtained when spectroscopic and crystallographic data were combined [40]; and this is evident here as the most conclusive results were obtained from higher resolution proton proximity data when used along side crystal structure information to support weak hydrogen bonding interactions.
