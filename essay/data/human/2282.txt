In the first phase of this report, I detailed the requirements of the client, FilmReel UK Ltd, of Reading, for the implementation of a World Wide Web (WWW) precence in the form of an E-Commerce website, allow the website to conduct business, and trade electronically, over the itnernet. This second phase of the report (Appendix "Z") will examine how I have implemented the proposed ideas and delivered on the business requirements established to produce a working first version of the FilmReel.com website. Version 1.0 of the website can be found on the CD-ROM attached to this doucment.
Leading up to the completion of Version 1 were a number of practical tasks, involving the creation of a new website structure using the chosen web development environment, Macromedia Dreamweaver. The framework for the website was fleshed out by desigining a site, local web directory, and testing server. The databases designed in the earlier phase of the report were created in Microsoft Access and placed within the framework of the web site hierarchy. Appropriate artwork was created from original designs using Adobe Photoshop. From this structure I developed the pages and structure over a period of several weeks, testing during and after development, with reference to the stakeholder requirements, to produce a final first-version presented herein.
