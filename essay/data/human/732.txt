Employers' organisations, alongside trade unions and the state (the influence of which is defined by the country-specific system of industrial relations) constitute the institution of 'social partners' - the major actors in providing the framework of employment relations in European states. Employers' organisations (or associations) are described according to an EIRO comparative study as the 'bodies designed to organize and advance the collective interests that employers have in the This definition builds on the fact that there are generally three types of organization structures of employers - the already mentioned 'pure employers' associations', 'pure trade associations' (promoting and defending the purely business interests of its members) and 'mixed (dual) associations' (combining the activities of the other two). This essay will explore only the features, roles and impact of the organizations that in Myrdal's (1991:192) words 'have companies as members and which are mandated by their members to deal with matters which have to do with the relationship between employers and their employees' - the 'pure employers' associations and the dual associations.
The interest of IR academics and practitioners (Sisson 1991, Traxler 2004, Hornung-Draus 2002, 2004) in employers' organizations has been prompted by several reasons. First of all, the systems of labour relations and the actors involved in them (including employers' bodies) are interdependent and have a continuous influence on each other (see also van Waarden 1995b). Secondly, although the strength and the above mentioned influence may not seem as guaranteed as these of the trade unions (due to the asymmetry within the employment relationship and the greater need employees have for collective action), Crouch notes that even if employer organisation has often emerged due to pressures of labour organisation, 'once goaded into action by labour, employers often set the pace for subsequent organizational development' (1993:114). Last but not least, interest in exploring the institution of employers' organizations is determined by the changes in the focus of their activity, brought about by increasing pressures for decentralization of collective bargaining in Europe, search for organizational flexibility and the growing internationalization of business (see also van Waarden 1995b).
By looking more closely into the characteristics and activities of employers' organisations in three European countries - Germany, Sweden and France, this essay will try to demonstrate that, although collective bargaining in them follows (if to a different extent) the trend for decentralization and is increasingly done at company level, there is still a role for the employers' organization in these countries, as well as more generally. This role may be changing its focus and venturing into new territories, which will be explored in greater detail below, but it is still a significant one and has become more diverse and complex than ever before. The three above-mentioned countries have been chosen because, although all are located geographically in Western Europe, each of them represents a different 'cluster' of countries with regard to industrial relations traditions - Germany belongs to the 'Rhineland' cluster, France - to the 'Latin' one and Sweden - to the 'Nordic' one (Marginson and Sisson 2004). In this sense, it would be interesting to explore how strong the similarities (due to the common European or 'Continental' context) or differences (due to the cluster influence) prove to be with regard to employers' organization and focus of activity in them.
The text will first look into the national context of each of the above countries with regard to the organization of employers, will outline the traditional and emerging domains of activity of employers' associations in them and will finally provide an evaluating conclusion. In doing so, it will predominantly concentrate on the so-called peak organisations in the countries, which work on a national and cross-sectoral basis (and more specifically, these of them that organize in the private sector), as this would make the discussion more feasible, but lower-level employer organisations will also be paid attention to as, in many cases, they have an important role in industrial relations as well.
Germany has a single national employers' peak association (NEPA), called Bundesvereinigung der deutschen Arbeitgeberverb By contrast, France and Sweden have multiple NEPAs - 4 in France and 5 in Sweden. France has one general peak association - Movement of French Enterprises (Mouvement des entreprises de France, MEDEF) and the other three organizations are demarcated on a sectoral (Federation of Farmers' Unions organizing in the agricultural sector) or firm-size basis (2 associations catering for the interests of small and medium-sized firms - the General Confederation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and the Craftwork Employers' Association). Sweden also has one general peak association - Confederation of Swedish Enterprise (Svenkst N
Fuctionally, the general peak associations in the three countries also differ - BDA in Germany is a pure employers' association, while MEDEF in France and SN in Sweden (created after the merger of the Swedish employers' and industrial associations - the Swedish Employers' Confederation (Svenska Arbetsgivaref
Below the level of NEPAs, in each of the three countries there are narrower associations which are either affiliated to the peak organisations or not affiliated to them, often in cases when they are created to represent the interests of specific occupational groups (especially in Sweden where smaller employers' organizations look after the interests of employers in the newspapers, broadcasting, theatre, hairdressing, some local public transport industries, etc.). The system in Germany is also particular because its branch associations at the level of regions are affiliated to both cross-sectoral regional (L
After having looked briefly at the nature and structure of peak- and below peak-level employers' associations in Germany, France and Sweden, the essay will now concentrate on their functions in each of the countries and will more specifically try to trace the shift of their focus from traditional to relatively newer roles.
By looking into the nature and activities of employers' associations (at peak and below-peak level) in Germany, Sweden and France, this essay has tried to demonstrate that they still maintain their important role in the industrial relations arena in the three countries. Decentralisation of collective bargaining has affected employers' organizations in the countries inevitably (if at different levels and to a different extent), nonetheless, as van Waarden (1998b) agues this does not necessarily reduce their authority or significance.
Indeed, employers' associations have a dynamic role, one that is moving from traditional to newer areas of activity and adapting to altering circumstances to serve their members adequately. Hornung-Draus reinforces that 'while their existence is no longer questioned today, the change in functions and profile seems to become a lasting one' (2002:220). This fact, however, does not diminish the importance of employers' associations' various roles, but rather confirms the need for activities that are relevant to and acknowledging changes in contexts and environments.
