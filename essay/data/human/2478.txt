'Biomass' is the broad term given for matter of biological origin. Biomass is defined as 'The total mass of all the organisms of a given type and/or in a given area; for example the biomass of trees' (6). Biomass in all versatile forms represents an important contribution to global primary energy use. The World derives 14% of its primary energy from biomass (1993). It is an important energy source (35%) for Biomass forms an important role in the natural carbon cycle (fig.1). Mankind's intervention of the natural biomass system can interrupt the carbon cycle, which has been linked to climate change.
We are using biomass in an unsustainable way, for example using up wood fuel faster than new trees can grow. Besides slope instability, landslides and mudflows this can also lead to desertification - less land for biomass energy crops, or land for re-forestation. In Indonesia we have cleared 9 million ha of tropical rain forests to grow palm oil 40% of which is for bio-diesel production. This hampers the fight against climate change, the very problem bio fuels are supposed to overcome (11).
Sustainability, education, management, and efficient use of biomass are vital factors in helping to reduce our effects of climate change. Biomass fuel crops (wood/bio fuels) need to be grown in a sustainable way so that we replenish crops as we use them. Producing and distributing biomass close to their source to reduce transport requirements. Recycling production by-products, for example where sugar cane fibres are burnt for electricity generation their ashes and washings can be returned to the soil as a nitrogen rich fertiliser (10).
