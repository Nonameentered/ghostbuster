It is necessary to dry the surface of agar plates before they are streaked because water contained many micro-organisms which will contaminate the plate. Then we cannot inoculate a pure culture. The moisture present will interfere with the production of discrete colonies. Also, water on the agar plate may dilute the culture and so we cannot get an accurate concentration or number.
The agar plates of bacterial cultures are incubated inverted as to prevent the condensed moisture on the lid from dropping onto the bacterial growth. Moisture dropping down onto the agar will cause fluid to run across the agar medium and cause contamination. This is also used to reduce bacterial contamination as the bacteria need to go upside down to approach the agar, even they get into the plate through the gap in between the lip and the base. Also, this provides a path for gaseous exchange as the bacteria need air to grow well.
The lines are streaked 2 times from the pool of bacterial growth (1) and 2 times not entering the pool (2). The steps are repeated 2-3 times as shown below.
By using this streaking method, individual microbial cells can be separated by spreading them over the surface of the agar. Thus they will have a chance to grow into individual colonies. This is to dilute the bacterial growth so that the numbers of cells are successively reduced.
Isolated bacterial colonies on the surface of agar media typically circular in plan view because bacterial have different plan of division to grow. The cells will layer up to obtain more oxygen on the surface.
A mould colony growing suspended in the middle of a bottle of a liquid medium should be in sphere shape as the filaments of the mould will grow in all direction.
