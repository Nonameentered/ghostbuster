The CF Tentoxin has two sites of action one located on the CF ATPase is activated by light via thioredoxin or alternatively by DTT and deactivated in the dark, an increase in temperature also increases the catalytic activity of the enzyme. A low pH across the thylakoid membrane and excess of ATP favours hydrolysis rather than synthesis; the catalytic activity of CF
The proton ATPase of chloroplast is regulated by light: it undergoes activation upon illumination and decays back to the latent state in the dark. There are two key factors that are involved in this light activation: protonmotive force and thiol reduction. The photosynthetic electron transport chain is responsible for the evolution of oxygen and the reduction of NADP+ but is also responsible for the acidification of the thylakoid lumen and therefore the creation of the proton motive force. The protonmotive force on its own is insufficient to activate the chloroplast ATPase; reduction of an intramolecular disulphide bridges in CF This reduction is achieved These regulatory elements are often lost during Dark inactivation of the CF
The rate of ATP synthesis can be measured in an assay in which ATP production is measured by measuring the rate at which NADPH is produced since it has a high absorbance at 340nm. While ATP hydrolysis, is measured by the appearance of inorganic phosphate produced by the hydrolysis of ATP.
The aim of the experiment is to investigate the regulation of the catalytic activity of the chloroplast coupling factor (CF These pretreatments will be performed when CF

Figure 2: The production of ATP by ATP synthase in the presence of DTT displays a trend displays a greater trend towards that of a linear one than that of the rate corresponding to no DTT, it must be noted though that neither displays a truly linear trend. The production of ATP at any given time point in the presence of DTT is greater than the corresponding tube in the absence of DTT.

ATPase undergoes activation in the light and deactivation in the dark Thiol reductants and oxidant are thought to be products of the electron transport system in light. This raises the question as to why the enzyme will preferentially interact with either the reductant or the oxidant. The answer for this lies in conformational changes that the enzyme undergoes (Figure. 4). In the latent enzyme a regulatory disulphide bridge located in the The exposed disulphide becomes reduced by thioredoxin which is reduced in turn by ferredoxin and the activity of photosystem 1. Alternatively the disulphide bridge can be reduced by DTT, this reduction activates the enzyme (c). Thus to activate the enzyme, light is required to generate a In the dark, ATP synthase returns to its latent form since reduced ferredoxin and thioredoxin are no longer formed and the decrease in the Thus the disulphide bridges form between cysteines, 6 residues apart in the sequence regenerate under these more oxidizing conditions. H Evidence for this lies in that the major site of peroxide production (acceptor side of photosystem I) is located close to that of the thioredoxin reducing system which forms a loose complex which is also associated with the same membrane.
The theory stated above coupled with the fact that ATP hydrolysis is favoured by minimizing the proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane and the presence of excess ATP explains A.3. Mixture 1 showed minimal ATP hydrolysis, since there was no light to activate the ATP synthase. Even in the presence of DTT (mixture 2) the rate of reoxidation of the ATP synthase by oxidants such as H In mixture 3 the presence of light created a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane therefore allowing the synthesis of ATP. However the excess of ATP favored hydrolysis rather than synthesis, the rate at which this was achieved was equal to that of what the conditions in 1 and 2 evoked. The same logic for mixture 3 applies to that of 4 however with the addition of DTT a greater percentage of the ATPase become activated thus the rate of hydrolysis per chloroplast also increases.
As temperature increases given that the temperature to which the enzyme has been increased to does not result to detrimental de-naturation in regard to catalytic activity the following rule of thumb can be applied; a 10 Reaction rates increase since the number of successful collision of substrate with the enzyme active site increases, thus explaining the increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis in B3 mixtures 1, 3 and 2, 6. Since it is known that activation of CF Once in the isolated form CF However upon the addition of DTT which mimics the activating effect of thioredoxin a greater percentage of CF
When the CF Hence why photophosphorylation (ATP synthesis), is said to be coupled to electron transport in the thylakoid membrane. Ammonium chloride is an uncoupler because it dissipatesthe proton gradient therefore destroying the potential energy that would be used for ATP synthesis. Ammonium chloride is able to do this since in solution, the NH Ammonia is uncharged and so can freely move across the membrane and into the lumen, where it re-associates with protons to again form an ammonium ion. As a result, protons are transported bypassing ATPase. In A4 in the presence of ammonium chloride there is a decreased proton gradient and a ATP concentration in excess explaining why ATP hydrolysis is favored rather than synthesis. In B4 the rate of hydrolysis is not significantly different from the control since both involve CF
Tentoxin selectively affects the function of the ATP synthase of the chlorophyll used. When isolated the CF One of which is located on the CF
Low intensity illumination is not the optimum illumination required for maximum photophorylation thus explaining why a linear relationship between the activity of ATP synthase and time is not shown. At an optimum illumination an optimum proportion of the CF Therefore explaining why chloroplast with DTT display greater ATP synthase activity at any given time point in comparison to that of chloroplast with no DTT. This increase in ATP synthase by DTT raises the activity closer to that of which one would expect to be exhibited under optimum condition. Explaining why the activity of ATP synthase in the chloroplast plus DTT shows a trend closer to that of a linear one than that of the chloroplast without DTT. If the chloroplast were exposed to very intense illumination then the rate of ATP synthesis by thylakoids would be at its optimum since the optimum number of ATPase would be activated. Thus the addition of DTT would not increase the rate of ATP synthesis since no more ATPase would be capable of activation.
A ratio of 0.26 mg CF The limitation of the ratio lies in the fact that only one type of assay: Biorad was performed to determine the protein concentration. Proteins are complex and variable in structure and because of this not one assay technique is capable of measuring the absolute protein concentration. Numerous assay methods have been developed, each of which measures a different aspect of a protein and often they have different sensitivity ranges. Therefore different assay techniques may produce different protein estimations so the importance of using the same assay method when comparing the concentration of unknowns when they are compared is off great importance. Since only one assay was performed and it is not known whether the same assay was used to come to the literature value of 0.40 mg CF
The catalytic activity of CF In the membrane form the thioredoxin reducing system forms a loose complex close to a key site of peroxide production. This proximity reduces the percentage of thioredoxin capable of reducing the disulphide bonds in CF1 into the chloroplast since oxidants such as H2O2 will accepts electrons from thioredoxin. Therefore the reduced concentration of thioredoxin becomes a limiting factor in the activation of CF1. However if the membrane is disrupted then the thioredoxin will be capable of releasing a greater concentration of thioredoxin into the chloroplast without the counter acting affect of the previously high local concentration of oxidants. With a higher concentration of thioredoxin a greater proportion of CF1 complexes can be activated even at the same
