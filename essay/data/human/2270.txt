To investigate the effects of friction on the processes of upsetting and heading of aluminium samples.
(See
The investigation into the effects of friction on upset forging has demonstrated that friction serves to impede the deformation of aluminium while lubrication has the opposite effect. This was proven in the load-reduction variations, where lubrication was found to precipitate the rate of length reduction of compressed aluminum. Furthermore, the sections corresponding to the lubricated and un-lubricated samples were analysed for grain boundary flow and the effects of friction were also manifested. It was suggested that the lubrication and consequentially the absence of interfacial friction had resulted in the homogenous and congruous flow profile signifying the stress magnitude across the section. The even flow pattern of the lubricated sample and its positive implications on material deformation was therefore linked to the absence of interfacial friction (lubricated sample) (?). The visual examination of specimen revealed, in general, that while frictionless upsetting resulted in even deformation, the presence of interfacial friction causes un-even deformation or barreling.
