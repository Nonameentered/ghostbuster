To study the velocity profiles for both laminar and turbulent flows through a pipe and identify the characteristics of each flow.
In order to measure the pressure drop between two points along the pipe later in the experiment, the Reynolds number is required in relevant calculations. The properties of the working fluid must also be known as a pre-requisite for experimental analysis. The first step was therefore to establish values for the density and viscosity of the working fluid, which was oil in the current experiment.
The experimental data was collected and tabulated for both the pressure and velocity variations across pipe diameter.
Before plotting the velocity variations for the two flow profiles the pressure difference against the distance across the pipe diameter is first plotted so that the symmetrical centre of the variation representing the centre of the pipe can be identified and used as the centre mark when plotting the velocity variations. The symmetrical centre is highlighted in table 3.1 and indicated by an arrow on the graph.
In accordance with the objectives, this experiment has enabled familiarization with the basic features identifying the different types of flow. It can be seen that whilst laminar flow is almost orderly, turbulent flow is so disordered that several models attempt to describe its velocity profile. It is evident from results that the Re regulates whether flow is laminar or turbulent. In particular, the Re indicates that where the inertial forces (numerator) dominate then there is turbulent flow. On the other hand, where the viscous forces (denominator) are relatively great then Re tends to a lower value and therefore laminar flow.
The last experiment showed that the turbulent flow resulted in much larger energy losses between the fluid and surface. The implication of this is that shear forces between fluid and surface are proportional to the speed of flow(?). The effects of this in engineering application can perhaps be demonstrated by a turbulent flow of air over an aircraft wing, where there will exist large shear forces when air of Re&gt;4000 is involved. It is obvious that such forces are detrimental to an aircraft wing (would case wear) and it seems impossible to affect the nature (i.e. Re etc.) of air in the case of an aircraft. But a possible solution would appear to lie in reducing the coefficient of friction of the aircraft wing(?) - ie smoothing the surface.
Finally, this experiment also illustrated how quantities such as mass flow rate and density are measured experimentally and from first principles. In general, the experiment has also demonstrated the need for meticulous experimental technique in order to minimise human errors which seem almost inevitable. But as in all experiments, it appears that empirical results will never absolutely equal theoretical results as there are always variables in the real world which are not encompassed in theoretical relationships - theoretical equations are static relationships whereas the real world is dynamic in that conditions are constantly changing.
