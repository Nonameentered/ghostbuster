The aim of the assignment is to design the most cost-effective waste heat recovery system. In order to satisfy the requirements, a suitable overall size of heat exchanger has to be selected first, and then fin geometry is chosen with the suitable overall size. After determination of these two criterions, value of oil saved and payback time of the system can be calculated respectively. In this assignment, two designs give nearly identical payback time should be selected, and the final choice of design will go with the maximum return over system's lifetime. In this design, the suitable overall size of heat exchanger is 400x400x500mm, and the two designs are surface 9.03 and surface 11.1. However, comparison with the return over system's lifetime between these two designs, surface 11.1 is the best design for the waste heat recovery system.
The object of the assignment is to design a waste heat recovery system. In order to design the most cost-effective waste heat recovery system, payback time has to be minimized. In this report, two designs that give nearly identical payback time are considered, and the one with the maximum return over its lifetime is selected.
The basic data is shown as below
The allowable pressure drop in the heat exchanger is 300 Pa.
Flow rate is 700
Mean outside temperature is 7.5 
C, operation time is October to April (8 hours/day, 5 days/week).
Oil costing 22 p/litre with S.G. 0.8 and calorific value 45 MJ/kg.
The heating system efficiency = 70%, electricity costs 5 p/kWh.
The pressure drop in the duct is 3 x dynamic head.
Conductivity of aluminum is 173 W/mK, cost 
1.65/kg.
Overheads of 400% apply to the cost of the aluminum.
The Appendix shows a spreadsheet of Heat Exchanger design. Six different overall sizes of heat exchanger are considered. In order to find out which dimension of heat exchanger is the best one for the waste heat recovery system, surface 9.03 (Reference 3) is tested with these different sizes of heat exchanger. Finally, the best one is 400x400x500mm, which gives the shortest payback time between the six optional overall sizes. After determination of heat exchanger's dimension, best fin geometry has to be chosen for the system. In the spreadsheet, four fin geometries are considered, which are surface 5.3, surface 6.2, surface 9.03 and surface 11.1 (Reference 3). From the spreadsheet, it shows that values of oil saved for these different surfaces are 76.9, 74.5, 90.3 and 104.1 respectively. And their payback time are 5.26 years, 6.87 years, 5.11 years and 4.41 years respectively. This indicates that the most cost-effective waste heat recovery system should choose surface 11.1 with 400x400x500mm.
From the spreadsheet in the Appendix, the six optional overall sizes are 200x200x250mm, 250x250x300mm. 300x300x350mm, 350x350x400mm, 400x400x450mm and 400x400x500mm, the payback time of these different cases with surface 9.03 are -30.50years, 30.81years, 6.37years, 5.34years, 5.17years and 5.11years respectively. Obviously, the first two choices are impossible, since the payback time can not be negative, and lifetime of the system is 10 years only. By considering the rest four, the last one is winner.
In terms of surface geometry, louvered fins are not taken into account, because the calculated pressure drop in the heat exchanger with louvered fins is greater than 300Pa, which is not satisfied with the assignment. In the spreadsheet, four plate-fin surfaces are considered. Surface 9.03 and surface 11.1 have got shorter payback time than the others, and the payback time is nearly identical, but their values of oil saved are different, hence, the return over its lifetime is different. The maximum one goes with surface 11.1, which is 581.3, while the one with surface 9.03 is 441.5.
To conclude, the most cost-effective waste heat recovery system should choose surface 9.03 with 400x400x500mm heat exchanger or surface 11.1 with 400x400x500mm heat exchanger, since their payback time are minimum, which are 5.11 years and 4.41 years respectively. Furthermore, by considering maximum return over system's lifetime, the surface 11.1 with 400x400x500mm heat exchanger is the final choice, because its return over its lifetime is 139.8 more than the former one, which is 441.5.
