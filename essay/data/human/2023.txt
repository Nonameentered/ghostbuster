UHT is a continuous process which involves rapid heating to high temperatures about 140
The direct UHT process is usually carried out above 135
It consists of 4 steps
The product is then placed in aseptic packaging that is commercially sterile and has a shelf life of approximately 6 months .(The aseptic packaging is sterilized using 30-35% hydrogen peroxide at 70-80
Prior to milk treatment the tube is sterilized by pumping hot water at 130
Safety of the product is key.
The Z value for Alternative processing conditions would be 131
141
'Ideally the processor would want a product that does not cause a lot of fouling, and which has little sedimentation with no gelation of the product after processing'
Preventing fouling is a major problem because of high temperatures used often result in a great deal of fouling
Steam tables are important because they enable one to establish an equilibrium temperature - pressure where the milk is heated to the necessary temperature without it boiling since temperatures greater than 140
Please see procedure detailed in practical bookle
The mean freezing point depression of milk is often quoted as -0.535 (Coveney L, 1993)
Raw milk gave a value of 517m Code of practice for the Assessment of milk quality) UHT milk however gave a reading of 516m
The in-container sterilised product is of lower quality because the product heats and cools relatively slowly; furthermore the temperatures are limited by the internal pressure generated.
Selection of the optimum equipment , raw materials and processing conditions is a key factor in the success of any UHT treatment .
