Nocturnal primates of the family Galagidae have recently been under great taxonomic revision due to new discoveries concerning their behavior and morphology. Effective conservation work is dependent on an updated taxonomy in order to acknowledge the width of the biodiversity one is trying to save (Grubb The proposed investigation concerns a taxonomic study of one up to five as yet scientifically unnamed primates of the genus 2003).
The research will be carried out in several steps and with different methodologies appropriate for descriptions of species (International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN, 1999):
An exhaustive literature study where previous descriptions of the target taxa will be researched. The information gathered will provide important background information vital for both the choice of scientific name and for the species description
Localize museum specimens for each species to conduct morphological research. New specimens of primates rarely occur in museums due to export regulations for endangered species (Baillie , 2004), however, the presence of these potentially new species often exist in museum collections under erroneous names (Bearder, pers. comm.)
Comparative analysis of recent field data including vocal recordings, behavioral data, biogeography, morphology and genetics (i.e. karyotyping). Much focus of the study will be directed towards the important, but neglected, area of karyotype analysis though it is a vital diagnostic tool in species recognition.
The study's main objective will be to compile sufficient amounts of character data, i.e. behavioral, morphological and genetic data, to enable the endorsement of species status independent of species concept (see Groves, 2001, for overview) applied with the specific aim as to publicly name these species in accordance with the regulations of ICZN (1999). The data collected will also create the body of a comprehensive database over the known information of the family Galagidae.
