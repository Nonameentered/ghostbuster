Dirichlet's paper of 1829 was mainly concerned with discovering the limit, if any, to which a Fourier series would converge and ascertaining what conditions a function would have to obey for its Fourier series to represent it correctly. The Fourier series of a function This in turn can be summed, giving equation (2) which is nowadays known as the Dirichlet Integral. Thus the problem reduces to discovering the conditions which must be placed upon
Dirichlet first considered 'the simplest cases, to which all others can be reduced' He considered an arbitrary function He then considered the integral (3), and worked on discovering its limit as the positive quantity k is increased. To begin with, he divided the integral into various others, the first from Therefore, the final integral, which will have a smaller range of integration than the others will be from Dirichlet noted that these integrals are alternately positive and negative, since the only part of the integrand which changes sign is sin(k
Now, taking Since f( He denoted the absolute value of the integral in this expression by K He did this by setting Dirichlet then used the established fact that the integral (6) is finite and in fact equal to This integral can be split up into infinitely many others, the first from These are alternately positive and negative, decreasing, and the absolute value of the integral of index Thus the infinite series k1 - k2 + k3.... converges to
Dirichlet then returned to considering integral (3) as a sum of its decompositions (4). He took a fixed, arbitrarily even integer Thus (3) will be divided into two sequences; the first group, having the same number of terms independent of In (7) since We have also seen that the K Using the definition of convergence this means that the difference between (7) and Smf(0) will always be less than an arbitrarily small positive value The sequence (8) will always be positive and less than its first value, and so will converge to a value less than km+1f(0) + Dirichlet also noticed that the difference between Sm and Since m can be chosen to be arbitrarily large, this limit will be arbitrarily small (since the k
Dirichlet then adjusted this argument to accommodate functions which were constant, negative, or increasing, and obtained a general statement: The integral (3), where
Next he considered a function This function is defined to be continuous between Provided Hence integral (9), the difference of the previous integrals, will converge to the difference of their limits. This will be 0 in all cases, except when g is 0, in which case the integral converges to (
The next part of the paper makes an important point - if the function admitted a discontinuity at If
He was now ready to consider the convergence of integral (2) as He first split this up into two other integrals, one from - He did this by setting
Let us consider (11) in the case where The integral is trivially zero when x = The function Therefore, they all converged to zero except the first, which converges to ( Considering the same integral, but with values of x less than zero, Dirichlet noticed that he could split the integral again, into two parts, one from The first of these is simply a case of the integral we have already considered, and so converges to the limit above; the second, upon the change of variables In this case, it will converge to the value ( In summary, integral (11) is zero when x =
Integral (10) is analogous to (11), and a similar treatment gives us that it is zero when
It is easy to see that integral (2) is simply equal to the sum of integrals (10) and (11) divided by Thus on adding the limits of the two integrals we get the result that integral (2), and hence the Fourier Series (1), converge to the limit (1 / 2)[ This is also defined at the extreme values of the integral, as being (1 / 2)[
In conclusion, Dirichlet had proven that in order for the Fourier series of a function to converge, the function has to admit finite and definite values, have a finite number of discontinuities and also have a finite number of maxima or minima between the extreme values - If the function has no discontinuities then the Fourier series will converge to the function itself; if there are discontinuities present, the Fourier series will converge to the mean of the limits that the function attains on either side of these discontinuities.
Finally, he remarked that we could relax the conditions on the number of continuities and extrema that the function admitted, so long as any subset of the function's image is not dense in our set theoretical sense of the word. If this was the case, we would always be able to split the graph into sections to which our previous arguments had applied. He gave an example of a function whose entire image was dense, which would not be representable by a Fourier series; it mapped rational numbers to an integer Attempting to split this into suitable integrals is impossible.
The importance of this paper cannot be underestimated. Before Dirichlet, no one had been able to give a successful proof of the convergence of Fourier series, although eminent mathematicians such as Cauchy had tried. Dirichlet refuted Cauchy's proof on the grounds that his convergence criterion was flawed; he gave a fairly simple example to support this claim. Poisson and Sturm had both previously criticised Fourier for assuming the convergence of his series, especially the convergence to the correct limit. Dirichlet appeared to share this criticism, and so gave the first rigorous proof of their convergence. Not only was this specific result important, but also the general style of Dirichlet's proof. He clearly sets himself a goal, and defines each condition and step as he goes along. This constitutes a major shift in mathematical thinking; whereas previously mathematicians considered theorems as being true but admitting exceptions, Dirichlet saw them as being either true in all cases, or not true at all. This is very much the standard up against which today's theorems are measured. His results are still used to this day, and even elements of his proof are retained by mathematicians today, namely the Drichlet Kernel This is used in a more modern interpretation of the Fourier series, which involves convolutions of Fourier coefficients with the Kernel, resulting in the Fourier approximation of the function in question.
