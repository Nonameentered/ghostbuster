For given reaction:
The rate law can be written in the following way:
Using the isolation method, and putting F in large excess we can assume [F] = constant. Thus meaning the rate of reaction will now have form:
where
A plot of time verses concentration of Br2, if linear, would mean that the order with respect to Br From graph 1, we can see it is not zero, since it is a non-linear graph. By plotting ln([Br Graph 2 shows the line is linear thus
By recording values of k' and [F] If this graph is linear, then the order with respect to F is first, and also the gradient of the graph will give the rate constant k. Graph 3 shows a linear plot, thus the order with respect to F is first. The gradient of the graph is = 140.59, but the concentration is 10
The oxidation of formaldehyde by chromic acid in perchloric acid has rate law:
If perchloric acid and formaldehyde are in total excess, the rate equation can be re-written as:
where
By plotting given values of [H From graph 4, we can clearly see it is non-linear. Plotting [H The gradient of this graph will also yield k[CH Given This means k = 7.9297 x 10-3 mol-2 dm6 s-1.
For the decomposition of N205, the rate coefficient was measured at several temperatures. From this information the activation energy can be deduced.
Thus by taking natural logarithms of both sides we get:
thus by plotting ln k vs 1/T, we find the gradient is equal to -Ea/R.
This can be seen in graph 4, where the gradient is -12395. We know that R = 8.314 J mol Thus Ea = 103052.03 J mol
