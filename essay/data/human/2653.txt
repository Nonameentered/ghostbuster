Polymers based on the silicon-oxygen linkage are the only major commercial polymers with an inorganic backbone. These polymers are produced by hydrolysis of an organo-dichlorosilane, followed by spontaneous condensation of the product silanediol with elimination of water. The final result is a long chain polymer known as polysiloxane (silicone).
If the reaction takes place at low concentration then the cyclic compounds; cyclopolysiloxanes are formed, this is due to the kinetic favourability for the 2 ends of the chain to react with each other than another chain (at low concentrations).
In the experiment, from the starting compound, dichlorodiphenylsilane one can isolate the intermediate silanediol, as diaryl compounds are found to be more stable than their dialkyl counterparts. Condensation of diphenylsilanediol in dilute solution gives two different cyclopolysiloxanes, one of them will be isolated depending on whether an acid or base catalyst is used.
See COSSH sheet
The literature melting point for diphenylsilanediol is 201-202
From the data collaborated we can see that we have prepared diphenylsilanediol and octaphenylcyclotetrasiloxane, however both compounds do contain impurities. These may have been encountered at various stages of our experiments, and one must also question the purity of our starting materials.
