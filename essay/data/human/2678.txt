As genomic DNA methylation is one way to encode epigenetic information that control development. There may be some connection between floral dimorphism in Methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion coupled with inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) PCR as well as a novel method that coupled enzymes digestion with real-time PCR were used trying to detect any methylation polymorphism between immature pods from chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers. However, as
