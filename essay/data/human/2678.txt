Impatiens noli-tangere produces both chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers and the genetic mechanism that controls the dimorphism in floral development is not known. As genomic DNA methylation is one way to encode epigenetic information that control development. There may be some connection between floral dimorphism in I. noli-tangere and DNA methylation. Methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion coupled with inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) PCR as well as a novel method that coupled enzymes digestion with real-time PCR were used trying to detect any methylation polymorphism between immature pods from chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers. However, as I. noli-tangere is not a modelled plant, very few sequences are available for primers design for real-time PCR. This as well other constrain on resources, no gene or locus was located that showed to have methylation-sensitive polymorphism between chasmogamous and cleistogamous samples.
