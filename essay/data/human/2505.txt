I have carried out a usability test of a way-finding system for the Armstrong Siddeley building at Coventry University. The test has been carried out on the initial interface of the website which is still under construction.
To identify the way-finding tasks that are useful for the "MIS Staff/Room Localizator" I did a research among my family and friends and asked them what information they will find useful in searching the way to a room or staff member in a building.
From all the answers I managed to create the list of 5 tasks which appeared most often.
