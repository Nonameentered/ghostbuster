A description of each food and its weight in grams are recorded before eaten, within 6 days.
 The intake of energy and nutrients of an individual is then assessed. The report processed is shown below:
Any measurement of diet will be biased in some way by the measurement process itself, so in practice, there is no entirely objective measures of an individual's food consumption. Since the Foodbase report processed has determined my intake of energy and other nutrients by the 6-day weighed dietary survey, the aim of the experiment has been reached. This again emphasises the importance of a balanced diet.
