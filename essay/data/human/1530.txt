As already sketched by the title, Joy Hendry's work Due to the limited scope of this review, the following paragraphs will briefly summarize the main issues and arguments about the element of wrapping in material as well as linguistic context and further comment on the value of this ethnography, as well as its contribution to the study of the Japanese culture. Where possible, further comparisons with the Western model will illustrate the similarities and differences between Japanese and occidental societies.
The ethnography is organized into eight sections each focusing on a different level of the concept of wrapping. Starting from the more material perspective, the analysis gradually moves towards symbolic and abstract 'layers' of discourse. It is therefore important at this point to take notice of several facts: A gift expresses different things about the relationship between people. The attitude towards wrapping may have a great significance because it reveals a major difference between the Westerns and the Japanese. (Hendry,1993,pp.13) While the focus of the former is on the object inside, for the Japanese the wrapping itself may be of far greater significance than the actual object being wrapped.
It is easy to notice, that the significance of status and reciprocity, discussed in the lectures (Sadgwick,2005), plays a key role in this context. First of all, it is unthinkable for a Japanese to stop the habit of exchanging presents once it has been established, as this would send a clearly negative signal about the relationship.
The status, age, and gender of the parties involved, as discussed by Hendry in chapters 2,3,8, would certainly be other important determinants of the style in which the presentation would be made. Moving to a more abstract 'layer' of analysis, Hendry recognizes the significance of Thus one can see, that in this respect, Japanese society is classed by clear boundaries based on these and many other aspects. It is true to say, however, that even in some western societies, like French, or Slovak, distinct grammatical forms are used to distinguish the status and age of the speakers
An interesting feature of wrapping words is sketched here. Not only does the use of In fact, there is a nice saying in Slovakia, which states that ''the way diplomacy works is by use of language that will not only send the unwanted advancer 'to hell', but it will even make him look forward to it''. This would however not work under all circumstances, because as pointed out in lectures, stress on logic and explicitness in Western culture would most probably obstruct a person getting away with much of the abstract demagogy embodied in such wrapping of words (Sadgwick,2005). It is thus easy to deduce that when a Westerner encounters a Japanese person, misunderstandings are more than likely to occur.(Janos,1998,pp.34-37) Referring back to the idea of 'upper hand', it is possible to argue that one can find similarities in the Bernstein's theories applied in West.
The account of female wrapping of speech presents yet another evidence of the strong divisions within the Japanese society and this book is a useful ethnography acknowledging this element: Because women are socialized into being polite and feminine in their language, the 'possibility of being assertive is radically reduced; women are more polite because they are less secure about their positions than men and language becomes more important for establishment and maintenance of their status.'(Hendry,1993,pp.157) On the other hand mastering of To put this into perspective, in West much emphasis is being put on the egalitarianism of men and women and assertiveness is certainly a feature that is not necessarily male any more In either way, from day-to-day observations, it is possible to say, that in West, too, women tend to be very powerful with their use of manipulative linguistic skills. When it comes to minor traffic infringements, for example, women may be relatively more successful to talk themselves out of potential fines than men.
The other aspects that were discussed by the book, but which were not touched upon in this review dealt with further layers of the 'wrapping symbolism' - the wrapping of body, space, social and temporal wrapping. But as we have seen, for the main demonstration of the concept, and more particularly the interaction between the material and symbolic 'layers', which is foremost for Hendry's book, gift wrapping and linguistic packaging are sufficient examples. We have observed how the book skillfully accounts for the differences emerging not only on the intra-cultural but also inter-cultural level. This ethnography thus clearly shows that Japanese society cannot be considered as a homogenous body, but rather as one constantly separated by divisions based on status, age, gender, class etc. Comparisons were made with the Western culture, but differences, too, are present, providing anthropologists and sociologists with many questions about inter-cultural understanding and communication.
