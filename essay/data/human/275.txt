The latter half of last century saw some of the most significant developments in international criminal law. With the establishment of two As a result, we have witnessed the emergence of what has been heralded as a
However, as I shall discuss, these developments are not without their limitations. The aforementioned Such philosophy has by no means been ousted among all nations, and as we shall see, it still serves as a critical restriction on the efficacy of international criminal law, as its enforcement is so evidently dependant on the co-operation of states, on their political will and their readiness to limit their sovereignty and submit to international jurisdiction.
In the following paragraphs, I will endeavour to analyse and assess these developments in international criminal law, and discuss whether they demonstrate that governments who commit the gravest breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law can no longer behave with impunity. I will focus on the operation and limitations of the two Firstly, however, it is important to establish an understanding into the history of international criminal law development, and the evolution of state's political and moral ideology, which forms the foundation of this so-called 'new era of accountability'.
International jurisdiction over the commission of international crimes by government leaders was almost non-existent prior to the twentieth century The doctrine of state sovereignty was held as sacrosanct, shielding individuals from accountability - National courts provided the only arena for punishing those responsible for the few crimes defined as 'international'
By the twentieth century however, religious, philosophical and political thinking had evolved significantly, resulting in a much greater awareness of the concept of human rights and humanitarian law, and an increasing emphasis on the need to The unprecedented scale of the atrocities committed during World Wars I and II "shocked the conscience" of the international community leading to Allied victors pledge that "never again" would anything similar occur. While attempts were made in the aftermath of WWI to punish the leading figures responsible for the commission of war crimes However, the subsequent atrocities committed during WWII demanded a more decisive reaction of the international community, resulting in the establishment of two International Military Tribunals, at Nuremburg and Tokyo.
The tribunals provided revolutionary developments in international criminal law. They established the principle and practice that individuals at the highest levels of government and military infrastructure could be prosecuted and punished The 'monopoly' over criminal jurisdiction held by States and the 'act of state immunity' that had so often protected leaders from liability in the past were removed However, major criticisms were levelled against the IMTs suggesting only a 'victor's justice' had been served, and to a large extent these are inescapable. Only the vanquished were put on trial, regardless of the atrocities committed by the Allies It was obvious that this mechanism of trial and punishment, immunising some whilst sentencing others, could not serve as a legitimate system of international criminal justice in the long run. It would be unable to acquire the respect and therefore the co-operation of the international community, and would only be able to come into existence "
Nevertheless, the tribunals importantly served as a Demonstrated by the considerable efforts of the newly created United Nations, over the next few years, With the rapid adoption of several momentous international agreements, in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Genocide Convention in 1948, and the 1949 Geneva Conventions, combined with the work undertaken by the specially appointed ILC
However, the ensuing Cold War era led the international community into a standstill. It produced a climate of political stagnation which froze foreign interference in domestic affairs and impeded the functioning of the UN Any further development of international criminal law was put on hold It was not until some 40 years later, after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the collapse of the Soviet Union, that the international community regained its drive towards ending impunity, the success and limitations of which I shall now discuss
The end of the Cold War led to a dramatic change in geo-political power structures and attitudes. Agreement in the UN Security Council was rekindled, as was the international community's desire to establish "permanent and effective bodies to dispense international justice" The end of the Cold War also led to the removal of the forces that had been able to guarantee "a modicum of international order" This allowed religious and ethnic conflicts that had been smouldering beneath the surface to erupt into instability and conflict, leading to "gross violations of international humanitarian law, on a scale comparable to those committed during World War II" The Balkans and Rwanda saw tremendous blood-shed, involving genocide, 'ethnic cleansing' and other crimes against humanity, and it was in response to these shocking atrocities that the international community's reaction materialised with the creation of two ad hoc criminal tribunals under the auspices of the UN Security Council (SC)
Mandated to punish individuals responsible for grave violations of international law, the ICTY and ICTR have achieved some considerable successes to that end and have contributed substantially to the development of international criminal law. The establishment of the tribunals in itself, first and foremost demonstrates the intention and capability of the international community at large to punish war criminals, and in this sense sends an important message to government leaders worldwide that there is now the potential for their being brought to justice Since coming into force, 108 accused have appeared in proceedings before the ICTY, including most importantly and for the first time, an incumbent Head-of-State The ICTR has also secured the arrest, trial and conviction of a number of high ranking officials and ministers, including a former Prime Minister
Unlike their predecessors in Nuremburg and Tokyo, their creation by the SC means the tribunals' statutes are binding upon all UN member states and call upon all states to " This origin, coming as it did from the full international community, immunises the tribunals from challenges of 'victor's justice' which had to be endured at Nuremburg and Tokyo. It was no longer the victors emerging from the aftermath of warfare that were indicting, prosecuting and judging war criminals but a body of UN-appointed and elected individuals, representative of a wide range of nations.
The tribunals also exert primacy over national courts This tackles the aforementioned shortcomings of national enforcement of international criminal law, which had been demonstrated so blatantly at Leipzig The tribunals also have at last given effect to the numerous aforementioned conventions reached mid-century, through its judgements concerning war crimes, genocide Both tribunals have gone further in developing substantive law, incorporating sexual crimes such as rape into the context of crimes against humanity Opening a new area for tribunals of this nature, Article 4 of the ICTR statute enables the prosecution of persons who commit or order to be committed serious violations of Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions and of Additional Protocol II during to armed conflict
However, whilst all of this demonstrates that significant strides have indeed been taken by the world community towards ending impunity, we must of course appreciate the substantial limitations of these tribunals. Both are only Resources (and the lack thereof) are also key to the tribunals' efficacy, and they have been a recurrent problem for both, However, the most fundamental weakness of the tribunals relates to enforcement.
Unlike national courts, the international criminal tribunals have no law enforcement agency akin to a police judicature There is thus the existence of a 'Catch-22' situation: for a case to commence, the co-operation of those very states in whose name the war criminals were more-often-than-not acting is required to bring indictees forward. Obviously, in a situation such as former Yugoslavia where the Whilst both tribunals' statutes The ICTY in particular has encountered massive problems in arresting and acquiring evidence against accused individuals. Despite having been indicted nearly a decade ago, and having even appeared in public on occasions, Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karad Even after four years of the tribunal's creation, Republika Srpska had failed to execute any of the scores of arrest warrants addressed to it, while the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had not even enacted legislation to enable it to cooperate with the tribunal Evidence collection has been notoriously difficult and investigators have even identified instances where state officials have led efforts to conceal
Having considered these, just some of the many problems encountered by the ICTs, it is clear that the fundamental reliance placed upon state co-operation serves as a huge obstacle to ending impunity, because Moving on now to consider the ICC, hailed as the most
Having fallen victim to the aforementioned institutional paralysis of the Cold War, the idea of a permanent standing international criminal court regained momentum in 1995 when the UN GA created a Preparatory Commission to carefully study the ILC's draft statute for the establishment of such a court The experiences of two
Again, the very creation of this institution illustrates, to a far greater extent than by the To date, 139 nations are signatories to the Rome Statute and 94 have ratified it, highlighting the existence of a truly global consensus aiming to end the impunity of governments. Enshrining substantive international criminal law on a global stage, the ICC will adjudicate over individuals accused of committing war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity The Statute has ensured all of the traditional immunities enjoyed by State officials, which shield them from outside scrutiny and prosecution, are swept away Thus, potential war-wagers from nations seeking to escape the ICC jurisdiction may nevertheless still be brought to trial. The permanency of the court negates the logistical drawbacks of setting up continuous
However, despite this revolutionary step in international criminal law, The ICC is a UN-independent, treaty-based organisation, entry to which is voluntary and dependent on the political will of states. If such will is lacking, states can choose to remain outside the court's jurisdiction and will be under no obligation to co-operate with it, thus, a severe restriction on the jurisdiction of the court exists. The choice of the USA to remain absent is particularly problematic. As the world's only remaining superpower, and " The failure of the League of Nations was largely attributable to the USA's absence and the UN has often been paralysed due to lack of US co-operation. The ICC therefore bears the risk of being similarly limited.
In similar vein to the ICTs, the difficulties of enforcement will also no doubt severely limit the efficacy of the ICC. Analogous to the statutes of the ad hoc tribunals, the Rome Statute obligates States to co-operate with the ICC but provides no mechanisms of enforcement to see that they do. Furthermore, one of the principle features of the ICC is that it shall be "complementary" It follows that before pronouncing on a case, the ICC must first establish that the State that This may clearly act as a disincentive for the much-needed co-operation from that State, and thus creates a major stumbling block with which the Court will have to come to grips. Again, when the gathering of evidence and the arresting of accused is so dependent on the good-will of states, the real impotence of international criminal justice can be demonstrated
Considering these developments in international criminal law, it is clear that governments are no longer guaranteed to behave with impunity. The legacy of individual accountability established at Nuremburg has been furthered and refined by the ICTY and ICTR, and will no doubt continue with the future operation of the ICC. The tribunals have demonstrated that individuals from even the highest levels of political and military infrastructure can be brought to justice before international courts and the creation of the ICC with its more global reach serves as a formidable warning to potential belligerents, epitomising the international community's intolerance of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
However, what is also clear is that international criminal justice remains escapable. While the will of the international community to put an end to impunity exists on paper, embodied in numerous treaties and conventions, their commitment and co-operation in practice has not been so forthcoming. The experiences of the There is little reason to expect that the ICC will fare much better in this regard, meaning impunity is likely to remain the rule rather than the exception in international criminal justice. Of course, as the ICC commences its first investigations
