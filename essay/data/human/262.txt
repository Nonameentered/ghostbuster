Pain arising in the hip is felt mainly in the groin and in the front or inner side of the thigh. Pain is often referred also to the knee and can sometimes be the predominant feature. In contrast, the 'hip' pain that is referred from the spine is felt mainly in the gluteal region, where it often radiates down the back or outer side of the thigh.
True hip pain is made worse by walking, whereas gluteal pain referred from the spine is aggravated by activities such as stooping and lifting, and is often eased by walking. In this case, however, weight bearing was not possible, let alone walking or stooping.
Other joints to examine - Pain in the hip area may be due to pathology in the lumbar spine, sacroiliac joints, abdomen or pelvis

This 89 year old lady has suffered from a serious fall that has left her with a broken hip requiring a major operation. This has severely affected her health status and no doubt this has hugely impinged on her mobility and made her more dependent on her son in both the short term and long term. She may well need extra help from social services.

Hip replacement undertaken, but developed post-op complications and has returned to hospital
