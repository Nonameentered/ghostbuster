From the history it appears that Dysphasia is an acquired loss of production or comprehension of spoken and/or written language secondary to brain damage. There are two main types of dysphasia - Expressive or Receptive. Expressive dysphasia is characterised by non-fluent speech produced with effort and frustration. Signs to look for on examination include malformed words and impaired reading and writing. Comprehension is intact, patients understand questions and attempt to convey meaningful answers. There may be co existing right arm and facial weakness. It is caused by a lesion in the posterior part of the dominant third frontal gyrus (Brocas area). Receptive dysphasia is characterised by empty, fluent speech. The patient is oblivious of any errors, reading writing and comprehension are impaired. It is caused by a lesion in the posterior part of the first temporal gyrus (Wernickes area). The examination will therefore need to differentiate between the two types of dysphasia. The motor system will also need to be examined for any evidence of coexisting weakness.
Dysphasia may develop as a result of vascular, neoplastic, traumatic, infective or degenerative disease of the cerebrum. The sudden onset of Vascular lesions also tend to improve with time which does not fit with Cardiovascular examination will therefore be important especially blood pressure, arrhythmias and carotid bruits which may all indicate risk factors for stroke. The recurrent episodes of dysphasia could be due to a vascular cause such as transient ischaemic attacks which are temporarily reducing the blood supply to the region of brain controlling language. There has been no history of head trauma to indicate this as a relevant cause of the dysphasia.
The episodes have increased in frequency since A space occupying lesion will lead to raised intracranial pressure depending on the size of the lesion. Signs of raised intracranial pressure include nausea and vomiting, headaches (often worse in the morning) and papilloedema, none of which If the lesion is a neoplasm, the speed of onset of symptoms suggest a malignant rather than a benign neoplasm. Intracranial tumours are classified according to their tissue of origin with the most common group of primary brain tumours being gliomas. This group contains astrocytomas, glioblastoma multiforme, oligodendrogliomas and ependymomas. They commonly occur in the frontal, parietal or temporal lobe.
Likely diagnosis at this stage would point to either a neoplasm in Another possible diagnosis could be recurrent TIA's due to e.g. carotid artery stenosis or valvular dysfunction as However from the history,
On examination On examination, However, her diary showed evidence of dysgraphia and jumbling of words which had become progressively worse since
Unfortunately we were unable to examine No evidence of special neglect as
On examination of the cranial nerves, no abnormalities were detected. Examination of the upper and lower limbs showed no abnormalities although temperature sensation was not examined and
From the history and examination it appears that This could be due to a space occupying lesion, or recurrent infarcts in the dominant hemisphere (Brocas area). The most likely cause of If the lesion is a neoplasm, the speed of onset of symptoms suggests a malignant rather than a benign neoplasm. Diagnosis of such a lesion will require CT or MRI imaging of the brain. Location of a primary tumour should also be investigated by e.g. chest x-ray and abdominal ultrasound or CT, to determine whether the lesion is a primary or secondary brain tumour.
On An urgent CT scan was ordered for evidence of a postoperative haematoma and
 There was no evidence of haematoma.
IV Dexamethasone (8mg) was prescribed to reduce the postoperative oedema and
 CT scan showed white matter oedema, midline shift and effacement of the ventricle on the ipsilateral side. There was also evidence of haematoma at the biopsy site which was not present on previous CT scan ( IV Dexamethasone 16 mg was prescribed.
 The samples showed malignant glioma composed of highly pleiomorphic astrocytic type cells with scattered mitoses. Once As the glioma is of such a high grade it is likely that The aim of the radiotherapy is to reduce the speed of growth of the glioblastoma and delay the speed of onset of symptoms.
The incidence of brain tumours is 5-15 per 100,000 per year accounting for approximately 2% of deaths. The most common type of primary brain tumour is the glioma (43%) followed by meningiomas (10%) and pituitary adenomas (10%). Brain tumours may benign or histologically malignant but will rarely metastasise outside the brain. Approximately 20% of brain tumours are secondary metastases - most commonly from the lung, breast and kidney [1].
Patients with presumed primary brain tumours have two surgical management options - biopsy or resection. Patients with severe raised intracranial pressure will obviously require debulking of the tumour in order to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion. Patients without signs of raised intracranial pressure or in patients where resection is impossible due to side effects of surgery, biopsy is the only option. In Studies into the benefits of surgical resection versus biopsy for malignant gliomas are limited and it has been identified that further large multicentred RCTs are required to conclusively answer the question of whether prior to radiotherapy, resection or biopsy is superior [2].
Treatment with chemotherapy has been disappointing as there is difficulty in finding a drug which will cross the blood brain barrier [1]. The benefit of chemotherapy in patients with glioblastoma is debatable. The Medical Research Council found no significant benefit in overall survival when evaluating the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with glioblastoma [4]. However, recent RCT studies by the EORTC (European organisation for research and treatment of cancer) showed a statistically significant benefit to median survival of treating patients with radiotherapy and Temozolomide compared to radiotherapy alone [4]. This is obviously an area for further research. Current NICE guidance state that Temozolomide is not recommended for first-line chemotherapy treatment for patients with malignant glioma who have failed primary therapy (surgery and/or radiotherapy), except in the context of a randomised controlled trial against a standard-treatment comparator [5]. NICE are currently appraising a different type of treatment - the use of carmustine implants and Temozolomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed high-grade glioma [7]. Future treatment options for patients like
As stated previously, Postoperative haematomas at the operative site occur in approx. 5% of patients and a transient neurological deficit occurs in approx. 10% of patients [6].
The care of patients with a brain tumour is multidisciplinary and requires the assistance of a neurosurgeon, an oncologist, a radiologist, an expert in radiation therapy and various members of the nursing team. Management varies depending on tumour location, tissue type, and co morbid conditions. Further neurosurgical treatment may involve the placement of a ventricular shunt if Despite the short duration of symptoms, Gliomas are often surprisingly large at the time of presentation, occupying much of a cerebral lobe. Indeed The treatment of gliomas remains difficult as there are currently no curative treatments [3]. This is because by the time the tumour is detected clinically or radiographically, the tumour is beyond the reach of local control [3]. The treatment of patients with malignant gliomas is therefore palliative. The aims of surgery are to establish a pathological diagnosis, relieve mass effect, and if possible, achieve a gross total resection to facilitate adjuvant therapy [3].
