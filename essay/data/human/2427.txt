This report details the design and implementation of an anemometer on an FPGA, using Xilinx ISE software. The task was split up into 6 main components, though the design was focused around including the ability to test, through scan. Most design was carried out in schematic form, with one part written in VHDL code. The report includes schematic diagrams for every part of the solution, along with simulation results, and documents any problems encountered, along with their solutions. Also, the necessary scan test patterns have been worked out and included.
In order to test the normal operation of the circuits in this project, all simulations were carried out with 'scanEnable' and 'clockSelect' at logic zero.
As stated in 2.2.2, to make use of the scan facilities included in the design, test patterns must be produced that will highlight any potential faults. Although these test patterns are not required at this stage (since a faulty implementation could just be reprogrammed to the FPGA), if this circuit was to be mass produced, faults could occur and each chip would need to be tested.
