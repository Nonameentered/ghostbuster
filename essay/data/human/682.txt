Transient Ischaemic Attacks are usually caused by the passage of emboli through the cerebral circulation which interrupts blood flow to the brain. TIA's may also be caused by a fall in cerebral perfusion due to dysrhythmia or decreased flow through stenosed carotid arteries due to atheroma formation. Signs to look for on examination would be an irregular heart beat and a bruit over the carotid arteries. If a carotid bruit is heard it is an unreliable guide to the severity of the stenosis. The main sources of emboli to the brain are thrombi and atheromatous plaques within the carotid or vertebral arteries or in the heart. Cardiac thrombi can occur due to atrial fibrillation which often occurs secondary to valvular heart disease. The patient may therefore have atrial fibrillation or auscultation may reveal signs of a heart murmur.
Transient Ischaemic attacks cause sudden loss of function (i.e. within seconds) and last for approximately 8-14 mins (> 24 hours treated as a stroke). Hemiparesis and dysphasia are the two most common presenting symptoms of TIA's,
others include:
Amaurosis Fugax - a sudden transient loss of vision in on eye due to the passage of emboli through the retinal arteries.
Transient Global Amnesia - episodes of amnesia lasting for several hours (presumed to be caused by posterior circulation ischaemia)
Differential causes for transient episodes could be syncope, postural hypotension (as a side effect of the medication
From the history we know that the cause of As previously mentioned, Observations showed that There was no evidence of anaemia from the general examination. Auscultation of the heart revealed an aortic stenosis which radiated to the carotid arteries. This is a possible site for cause of emboli, however mitral regurge is more commonly associated with production of emboli.
Carotid artery stenosis can be exacerbated by co morbid conditions such as chronic lung and cardiac disease. This is because the physiological changes associated with such conditions can also limit oxygenation to the brain and can result in cerebral ischaemia in patients who would otherwise tolerate even high-grade carotid stenosis [1].
 Although the emboli produced from the carotid have not yet left Socially, Daily home help or intermediate care may be required after discharge from the
 Clips were removed day 8 post op ( The carotid ultrasound on Future issues for consideration point at the need to operate on the right carotid artery. Surgery on an asymptomatic carotid artery is therefore not advised in The stenosis will be monitored through Mr
Major studies have shown the benefits of carotid endarterectomy as compared to medical therapy in symptomatic patients with a carotid artery stenosis of 70% or greater - with only eight carotid endarterectomies needed to prevent one stroke in symptomatic patients. Carotid endarterectomy has been shown to reduce the risk of disabling stroke or death in patients with stenosis exceeding 70% (ECST) or 50% (NASCET) [1]. However, this result is only applicable to surgically-fit patients operated on by surgeons with low complication rates (less than 6%) (Cochrane).
The optimum time for surgery in these patients is 2 weeks after the patients last symptoms, however, the chance of a patient being admitted for theatre within this time period is minimal. Trans cranial Doppler is used to assess microemboli, a high load of which is associated with early carotid thrombosis and increased risk of stroke. The This treatment aims to reduce the risk of stroke until the patient can be treated safely on the next surgical elective list [2].
Initially Local anesthesia has the advantage of allowing direct evaluation of the patient's neurologic status without sophisticated monitoring. This enables the surgeon to operate on the majority of patients without the need for a shunt which may pose an increased risk of stroke to the patient. General anaesthesia has the advantage of improved airway control and patient comfort during prolonged operations. However, it does require the use of routine or selected shunting, and selective shunting requires the use of some form of cerebral monitoring to assess the need for a shunt i.e. transcranial Doppler. There is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials comparing carotid endarterectomy performed under local and general anaesthetic [3]. Evidence from non-randomised studies suggests potential benefits with the use of local anaesthetic. This is a potential area for future research and randomised studies [3].
Epidemiology - There are approximately 130,000 strokes per year in England and Wales of which approximately 15-25% are caused by an abnormally narrow carotid artery [2]. It is estimated that approx 10% of people > 80 years & 5/1000 aged 50-60 yrs have a carotid artery stenosis > than 50% [4]. The more severe the stenosis the greater the risk of a stroke and permanent disability for the patient [4].
The risk factors associated with carotid artery disease have been mentioned previously. Patients with high risk factors should be encouraged to reduce their risk factors e.g. through smoking cessation programs and dietary advice.
In However, the decision was made to perform the endartectomy on the left as this was the side producing the emboli responsible for The left artery posed a greater problem for It is important that patients receive adequate explanation and reassurance as to the reasons for surgery particularly if as in
Ethical issues of non resuscitation - Patient requests for non resuscitation should always be documented in the patient's notes. The patient may already have an advance directive a copy of which will need to be obtained.
Indications for surgery - asymptomatic and symptomatic patients
Use of transcranial Doppler ultrasound as a means of monitoring emboli production from the atheromatous plaque, pre, peri and post operatively.
Use of long term medical management of a patient with a symptomatic carotid artery stenosis.
