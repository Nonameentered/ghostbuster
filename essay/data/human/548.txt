The objective of this report is to formulate a model to determine the variables which affect the exam performance in the first year module Quantitative Techniques. The performance is measured by the marks students got for this module each year from 2002 to 2004.
Set the sub-sample of 2004 students as the reference category and define 2 dummy variables D02 and D03.
The regression model now is:
Regression models for performances of year 2002, 2003 and 2004 students respectively:
Using OLS, we get
Comparison of the three regression equations:
The intercept in 2004, 41.71, is much higher than any other year, which shows that even if year 2004 students do not go for lecture, they could obtain an average higher mark than previous years' student. This is possibly due to the same reason as mentioned in Q3.
Class attendance in 2003 could make a bigger impact on the exam performance when compared to it in 2002 and 2004
Students' ability in 2002 could make the biggest impact on exam performance when compared with 2003 and 2004.
Number of A-grades at A-level seems to have almost five times as much impact on exam performance in 2002 and 2003 while compared to 2004. Possible reason is the same as in the first point. Other reasons can be students' qualities are similar in 2004 with same number of A-levels so one's A-level performance is less influential.
The restricted model is:
The unrestricted model is:
F-test value Therefore, we fail to reject
The steps to formulate the model are:
Using correlation matrix
Using two-tailed t-test Due to Therefore, I decided to remain only one of them instead of two. With a t-value of 0.35 and 0.70 respectively, TOPB and ATTL are dropped.
Next, considering all the answers to previous questions, I decided to include the variable ATTR even though it did not show a significant correlation with QTMARK in our correlation matrix. Its significance on QTMARK is already tested in Q2b). Moreover as seen also in Q2b), variable HRSQT have significant coefficient and outstanding t-statistics. Hence both variables are included.
From the regression, I could see that ATTR and HRSQT both have an outstanding t-value of 3.12, 1.70 respectively. Furthermore, the R-squared value has increase from 0.255 to 0.273 which means the new model could explain more variation in QTMARK. This further confirmed the inclusion of these two variables as explanatory variables in the model.
Based on the conclusion I have got from Q4 and Q5, I Therefore, I need to add dummy variables D02 and D03 to the final model.
Based on my comparison in Q1 between different groups
From the regression result DMPASS will still be included as I believe This is consistent with my finding in Q1, that s Moreover, the coefficient of DMPASS is 1.57, among the highest coefficients. In addition, Due to collinearity between DMAPSS and DMATHA, I also expect the coefficient of DMAPSS to increase as I drop DMATHA.
Regress QTMARK on the selected variables now I am now satisfied with the variables I have considered for the model: ABILITY, ALEVELSA, ATTC, EXPALC, ATTR, HRSQT, D02, D03, DCOURSE and DMPASS.
The The coefficient of DMAPSS also increases, as expected, from 1.57 to 2.12.
I think we may better specify the model by considering these variables but in different functional forms. I begin with taking the logs of all the quantitative variables (not dummy variables) R-square has decreased from 0.3462 to 0.2739, which means log function of quantitative variables could not explain more variations in QTMARK.
Now I try two different functional forms, one is squaring all the quantitative variables; the other one is taking the square-root of all the quantitative variables. In both cases, R-square decreases. Hence, given the trial and error effort, I am concluding to the best of my ability, that the optimal function should be of a linear form. My best effort has resulted in the following model specification:
