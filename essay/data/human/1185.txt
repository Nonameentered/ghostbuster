'Peak Oil' and climate change are the two most important issues facing today's society. Action must be taken now in order to successfully mitigate the forecast consequences.
In relation to 'energy future' two possible strategies provide solutions;
A continued growth rate with no adverse environmental effects is obviously favourable. But is this possible?
Paul Mobbs is an independent environmental consultant who has explored the data, trends, projections and outcomes surrounding 'Peak Oil' and climate change. His views are largely objective and well researched. He is without doubt, however, an environmentalist; hence the presented facts are on occasion reflecting his own agenda.
Mobbs concludes that the only viable future contingency is a reduction in energy consumption by 75%. In the process evaluation he dismisses nuclear power as viable primarily due to waste management issues. He also suggests that nuclear power could only be maintained, at current levels, for 100 years. This report focuses on proving these assertions wrong by analysing viable energy resources and waste management strategies.
From the critical analysis the following conclusion can be drawn;
Supplies of uranium suitable for fission are far higher than Mobbs estimate. Fast breeder reactors can utilise other Uranium isotopes, expanding 0.7% uranium usage to a potential 100%.
Thorium is of great abundance in the earths crust (roughly 3x that of uranium) and is a proven nuclear fuel. Operational thorium reactors are well documented; further research and development of this technology would expand possible nuclear fuel resources by a factor of 2.
Maintaining current levels, the total nuclear energy supply will last ~30000 years.
Upon replacing all other energy sources, nuclear power has the potential to power the world for ~1000 years.
Waste management is progressing rapidly, with several methods providing safe long-term solutions. Subduction zone disposal would provide waste disposal in the absolute sense.
Nuclear fission has the potential to act as a 'stop-gap' between 'Peak Oil' and fusion.
Energy is the impetus behind every aspect of modern life. It powers everything from transport to manufacture, providing us with the means to live a life which has been deemed normal by society and fuelled by consumerism and development. The devastating effects of this lifestyle are becoming more apparent each year; events such as Katrina increase public awareness of climate change. However few people acknowledge the significant role they play in the world's future and furthermore even on realisation of the evidence fail to adapt their lifestyles accordingly. Whilst the world's population continues to rise and capitalists continue to promote growth and development, disaster looms.
'Peak Oil' and global warming are the two most important issues facing today's society. Action must be taken now in order to successfully mitigate the forecast consequences.
This critical evaluation will be largely centred on the information given in 'Energy Beyond Oil' in relation to the future of nuclear power. This is an integral element to the conclusions drawn by Mobbs; if nuclear power is in fact feasible in the long-term, much of his evaluation will prove redundant.
Nuclear power generation is certainly not without problems. Owing to a history marred by failures, the general public considers it unsafe and adopt a 'not in my back yard' attitude to every aspect of the industry. Opinions can be changed with time and proven good practice. Opinions aside, as Mobbs correctly points out the two potential drawbacks of nuclear power are the waste products and the amount of uranium available. These two issues will shape the future of nuclear power.
