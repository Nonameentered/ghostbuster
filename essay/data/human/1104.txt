In 1969 two satellites, called Vela 5A and Vela 5B, were launched into Earth orbit with In positron emission tomography an isotope is injected which emits positrons. Upon striking the normal matter inside the body two
 The energy of a Predicting or explaining certain Thus
Electromagnetic radiation with energy greater than 100 KeV is generally referred to as However, hard X-rays can also have this high energy. The difference is that
Pair production occurs in the intense electric field near the protons in the nuclei of the absorbing material. A This type of interaction is seen as peak 2
Compton scattering occurs between the energies greater than several hundred KeV and less than around 5 MeV. The process involves the The electron is given a forward knock and the photon can be scattered off in any direction. In two dimensions the interaction can be written as momentum conservation equations
Where
Solving the equations of momentum conservation in all three dimensions gives the new
Where
The extreme where = means a head-on collision and the photon loses the most energy. This is shown on spectra as the Compton edge. It is an edge since there cannot be any Compton scattering events detected between this energy and the photopeak. The energy of this Compton edge can be found by setting = in equation (3), so for a given initial energy h, the edge is at energy:
Because the photons can be deflected through all angles from 0 This produces a continuum on the spectrum.
The original equations (1) and (2) are based on the electron being free. The more likely scenario is that the electron is bound to an atom. In this case the Compton edge will not be so pronounced and will appear rounded off.
The third type of The This photoelectron is freed from the atom and has the energy of the incident This binding energy is 33 KeV for the iodine K-shell and so for As the electrons still bound to the atom rearrange, an X-ray is emitted to conserve energy. In iodine this characteristic X-ray is emitted 88% of the time.
Since the photoelectron carries the energy of the incident
The oldest method of creating a spectrum is to use a scintillator to convert the This signal is converted from its analogue form into a digital signal that can be interpreted by a multi-channel analyser. This set up is depicted in Figure 1:
Scintillators can be organic or inorganic. Inorganic scintillators have impurities added called "activators". These activators add energy states in the band gap of the scintillator material that an excited electron can access when given energy from the The excited electron drops down to an activator ground state and releases a photon corresponding to the energy of the incident Refer to reference [7] for a more complete description outside the scope of this introduction.
The scintillator photons are chosen in the visible range, and as a photon comes in contact with a photocathode the photon's energy is transferred to an electron. This electron then migrates to the surface of the thin photocathode before escaping the surface and going into the electron multiplier. The electron multiplier is a series of dynodes. The dynode material is chosen so that upon absorbing an electron, it reemits more than one electron. This secondary electron emission yield is sensitive on the incident electron energy, and temperature. Finally the electrons are absorbed on an anode and this produces a measurable current that will be proportional to the initial A complete photomultiplier tube is shown in Figure 2:
The output voltage is analogue, and is then digitised. Compared to the time taken for this digitalisation the scintillation, photoelectron emission, multiplication and detection happen quickly. Because the conversion takes longer than the measurement some measurements may be missed. The live-time is the time when the converter is observing the detector for peak voltages and not doing conversions. The difference between the actual time taken for the readings and the live-time as called the dead-time.
The multichannel analyser does this conversion and stores the digital data. They can also perform such functions as adjust the gain, shaping time, pile-up rejection and spectrum stabilisation. These, and other facets of MCAs, are discussed in more detail in reference [8].
The end effect is that the MCA can display a spectrum of energies of the A typical spectrum is shown in Figure 3:
The X-ray peak in Figure 3 is caused by the For example,
Backscatter peaks occur around 0.2 MeV and are caused by
Annihilation peaks are from pair production (discussed above) in the material surrounding the detector and thus occur at 0.511 MeV.
The Compton edge, which theoretically should be a sharp edge, is rounded due to bound electrons having a spread of energies as well as the resolution of the detector. Multiple Compton events are caused by Compton scattering occurring outside the scintillator crystal, such as scattering off the table.
The resolution of the detector is defined to be the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the photopeak divided by the central energy of peak, the FWHM is shown in Figure 3. This is related to the relative detector efficiency by the peak-to-total ratio. The counts under the photopeak divided by the total counts detected gives the detector efficiency. The Compton continuum hence decreases detector efficiency.
The probability that a nucleus in a sample will decay and emit a With many nuclei together the emission is independent, and if the half-life is much greater than the observation time, the emission will be constant too. Because the decay events are independent, random, and spontaneous the Poisson distribution can model the nuclear decay statistics. A binomial distribution would match too, as decay is a constant probability event during the short observation times relative to the half-life, but due to the large numbers of nuclei it is "computationally cumbersome.
Equation (5) gives the equation for the Poisson distribution:
Which gives the predicted probability of measuring exactly The predicted variance is equal to this mean, and the predicted standard deviation is equal to the square root of this mean:
This relation is a satisfactory test for the Poisson distribution. The aims of this experiment are to appreciate the statistical nature of the radioactive decay process and verify that radioactive is governed by Poisson statistics.
During this the aim is to learn how to collect and interpret Obtaining the
Identifying unknown
Calibration relates the channel numbers of the multichannel analyser with actual energies. Without calibration the real energies of the However ratios such as detector efficiency would still be the same.
The equipment used to detect The microprocessor is in a PC and scintillator is sodium-iodide crystal doped with thallium (NaI(Tl)).
Sources of These sources were
The software on PC was used to reset any spectrum currently displayed and then start recording data until the spectral peaks were clear, that is, until the signal-to-noise ratio was high enough to accurately place the energy photopeaks of the sources in a definite channel.
The channel number the respective peaks were in were defined as having the energies stated above exactly. The MCA then uses a linear equation to define the energies of all the other channels.
Because the way the calibration is carried out systematic errors are likely to occur. Firstly if the temperature of the apparatus changes after calibration the detected energies will appear different. Secondly the MCA might not be linear and so only making two exact measurements would just be a linear approximation.
By calibrating the device it allows unknown photopeaks to be measured and thus can aid in the identification of unknown emission sources, which is part of the objectives of the experiment.
Having the apparatus at a fixed temperature or having a temperature correction function would prevent the calibration drifting away from true as the local temperature varies. Having more sources of known photopeak energy would enable a non-linear calibration to be made, if the MCA is not linear.
