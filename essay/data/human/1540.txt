Haymarket Publishing is launching a new electronic information package in May 2005. Called Finance Latin America (see appendix i), it will draw on the success of our Finance Asia product, which has achieved over 1 million page views per month and, in 2002, was named Best Interactive Publication in Asia by the Society of Publishers in Asia.
The aim of Finance Latin America is to become the definitive homepage for all financial professionals with an interest in Latin America.
We should build on the reputation of the Finance Asia site to reach prospects for the new site. The best ways of reaching our desired target market are through carefully targeted links and by sending informative, permission-based e-mails that include free, premium content. An advertising campaign in the trade press is too expensive for all but the biggest financial companies, but there are many established sites that would be useful affiliates and where advertising exchanges would bring in prospects and potential revenue.
