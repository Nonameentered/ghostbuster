In the course of playing the video game Thus, one of the objectives of the game is to collect as many of these objects as possible.
For any given objective (or This coursework aims to develop one such solution- i.e. to attempt to discover the best way to collect as many objects as possible.
The program is controlled by a while loop so the time need to execute the algorithm is ultimately dependent on the nature of the universal set A greater number of distinct elements in The actual execution time is affected by the distribution of the elements within For example, when attempting to obtain a set containing the elements {3,1, 4, 2}, the algorithm would achieve this faster from a set such as { On the basis of the model used in developing this algorithm, the execution time would vary due across runs due to the random distribution of the elements contained within the set
If the number of distinct objects is given by the constant Whatever comes after is irrelevant. Using the exercise example of This assumes that calling a subroutine is only counted once, as a single step, ignoring their internal steps.
A common application of sets could be in programs that generate random sets of numbers for lottery tickets, bingo, etc. So for example, with the National Lottery, there may be set 48,49}. The program must then generate subsets which contain 6 elements with no repetitions within the sets.
