SWBC I shall advise Laura whether SWBC's EC is effective, or if she can make a negligence claim for her losses.
At common law, SWBC must illustrate incorporation of the EC into the contract; this can occur either by "signature, notice, or...course of dealing". The EC was referred to by a sign on SWBC's premises An EC will be incorporated only if "reasonable notice of its existence is given." Whilst SWBC "need not show that [they] actually brought it to the notice of the other party",
With relevance to the first condition,   The EC must be contained within a contractual document, rather than one acknowledging receipt. No reference was made to the EC by the staff, tickets or receipts; a I suggest this is insufficient, especially if Laura did not see the notice: Yet if they knew there was writing, or believed it contained conditions, terms would be binding. Furthermore, in Subsequently,
Should SWBC claim Laura was aware/accepted the EC, Whilst SWBC gave notice that terms exist, and these terms are available without further cost (unlike In Whilst a very questionable and perhaps unreasonable
Additionally, the more unusual/unexpected the conditions are, the higher the degree of notice required. ECs are relatively common and Perhaps however, a LC, In Whilst Consequently, I suggest SWBC's notice is insufficient, and unlikely to be incorporated.
Nevertheless, SWBC could argue their terms were incorporated by a previous "course of dealing". This position is however "inconsistent" As Laura has made this trip from "time to time", From the facts provided, I suggest it is unlikely that Laura was aware of the EC; let alone accepting it. Furthermore,   Laura has only made this trip from "time to time": I propose she has no knowledge of the EC, or acceptance; and in any case has not fulfilled the consistent course of dealings required by Incorporation through previous dealings is improbable.
 It will be interpreted  SWBC's EC appears to be of a standard, commonly used form. It can be easily understood and recognised by consumers. Secondly, it expressly covers any "loss or damage" Furthermore, unlike Glynn
For SWBC's EC to have effect it must be compatible with UCTA and UTCCR, which contain "important legislative limitations". UCTA makes specific EC's ineffective "in all circumstances"; Laura dealt as a consumer, like in Under S.2(2),
The court will examine SWBC's EC under S2 in light of reasonableness. As a "judicially administered requirement of reasonableness is a source of uncertainty", The term must be reasonable at the time of contract formation (S.11(1) Whilst Schedule Two appears relevant only to transactions under the SGA,
Under S.11(5) Schedule Two lists a number of factors that Firstly: The bargaining strengths of the parties, and the availability of alternative supplies: Laura had no opportunity to bargain with SWBC, the terms were 'standard form,' and non-negotiable; whilst public transport is usually limited to a single provider; restricting choice. Furthermore, other companies may have similar policies. Secondly: Whether the customer "received an inducement to agree to the term": Thirdly: Whether the customer knew or ought to reasonably have known the existence or extent of the term: Laura's knowledge, if she was unaware of the notice and as she has only travelled from "time to time" is poor; therefore it would be unreasonable for her to accept these terms; particularly as she would have limited prior knowledge at the time of contract formation - terms were only displayed on the coach.  This raises the issue of insurance: it may have been possible for either party to insure their goods. It may be difficult for SWBC to insure as they would never know the type/value of goods they were carrying; but they could have insured it to a limit and used a LC.  On the balance of probabilities, Laura's unequal bargaining power, limited previous knowledge, and lack of choice, and the extremity of excluding all liability are indicative of unreasonableness under S11.(1). Furthermore, under S11(3)
For SWBC's EC to be effective, it must SWBC's EC was not individually negotiated under Regs.5(2):
Under Regs.8(1), UTCCR applies where one party is a business, SWBC is a "seller" or "supplier": "acting for the purposes of [their] trade, business or profession"; whilst Laura is a "consumer", "acting outside trade, business or profession" (Regs.3(1)). A term will, under Regs.5, be regarded as unfair if it is "contrary to the requirement of good faith, causing a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract, to"
Firstly a "significant imbalance of rights must exist". The court will consider the nature of goods/services, and all circumstances "attending the contract's conclusion". I would assert the EC
Secondly, the transaction must be "in good faith", defined under The term must be expressed openly: "fully, clearly and legibly", Furthermore, Schedule Two Schedule Two(i): Laura can argue she was bound to terms which she had no "opportunity of becoming acquainted before the contract's conclusion"; It is probable that the EC is "not binding" under Regs.8(1): it creates clear "detriments"
Laura's loss was incurred as a result of third party negligence. She Under the privity of contract, third parties not party to the original contract have historically not been protected by EC's, even where it purports to include them: However, as this precedent was "commercially inconvenient", The court Under S1 C(RTP) Act, S1(3) Requires the party to be "expressly identified",
Laura is in a strong position to make a claim for her losses. Whilst SWBC's EC is well constructed, it is unlikely to be incorporated: notice is unreasonable; whilst incorporation through dealings is improbable: Laura travelled from "time to time". It is unreasonable under UCTA and unfair under UTCCR. Paradoxically, if
