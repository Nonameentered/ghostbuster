Census is a very practicable parameter in investigating the correlation with flora and fauna and a certain area over which the wildlife ranges, however, none of the techniques can be perfect due to the biases or errors and the time or the availability of the resources such as the amount of fund and the number of observers both of which are limited. The objectives of the bird census for housing development project at Theale gravel pit complex were followings;
What bird species breed at the site and how many breeding pairs are present.
What bird species and how many individuals are present during the winter.
How the various duck species use the gravel pits and which of these are the most important for them.
Tree census on three tree species of Japanese hackberry Celtis sinensis, Quercus actissima and Quercus serrata at plain broadleaf woodland aimed to estimate the population density of those three tree species to research on the habitat availability and the conditions for butterfly species Sasakia charonda.
This report will identify and evaluate the available techniques for each of the studies.
Great purple emperor butterfly Sasakia charonda used to spread throughout Japan and was designated as national butterfly in 1957. butterflies are commonly found in relatively large plain broadleaf woodlands where three tree species of Celtis sinensis, Quercus actissima and Quercus serrata. are abundant. Eggs are laid on the ground nearby a large mature Japanese hackberry tree Celtis sinensis and larvae are monophagous on the leaves of this tree species and herbernate beneath the fallen leaves under their host trees. When reached maturity, adult butterflies only feed on the sap of either Quercus actissima or Quercus serrata (Tsukuba CEM, 2005). This specific feeding requirement has been a cause of the drastic decline in the population in the last few decades accompanied with the fragmentation of broadleaf woodlands, resulting in the species to be listed on the National Red List Data (Wikipedia, 2005). However, scientific research in terms of measuring the population size and its relationship with the areas, species abundance of the vegetation or other features of the habitat has not been developed in sufficient quantity to establish a conservation scheme (Kitahara,. et al. 2004). While the population census on the butterfly provides vital information on the species status, the survey on the host tree species is also highly required and useful to estimate the habitat availability and likely changes in the butterfly population in the future. In fact, the population census on the tree species is more widely practiced (Kitahara,. et al. 2004, Tsukuba CEM, 2005. Tochigi CEM.2005) partly because of the relative ease and effectiveness in study in terms of time and cost. Therefore, tree census may be appropriate in investigating the conditions of the habitat and butterflies in an area of woodland.
Two examples of bird and tree census have demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of various methods which are sometimes dependent upon constrains specific to a particular study. With the well-prepared protocols, it is possible to carry out the population census to produce a reliable outcome with great precision.
