The document contains two parts:
Part one offers guidance to companies involved in making resource decisions. Outsourcing or insourcing can encompass a wide range, from a particular project to a functional area to all activities. Each situation requires a different understanding of priorities, measures, costs, and benefits. The paper discusses the reason to outsource for companies and the benefits the companies can get. It also mentioned about the impact of outsourcing on the revolution of supply-chain management and its own management. Finally, methods will be given on how to make an appropriate outsourcing decision.
And part two shows how the lean and agile paradigms may be selected according to marketplace requirements. These are distinctly different, since in the first case the market winner is cost, whereas in the second case the market winner is availability. Agile supply chains are required to be market sensitive and hence nimble. This means that the definition of waste is different from that appropriate to lean supply.
