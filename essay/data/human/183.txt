A decision was made to attempt to obtain quantitative data regarding the chemotaxis behaviour of the bacteria under analysis. In addition to the analysis of the motile behaviour of the bacteria, attepts were made to discern the effect of a chemical to the motility; the chemical under scrutiny was succinic acid. The motile behaviour of both M. Xanthus and E.coli were be observed and recorded and compared.
The experiments designed fall distinctly into two categories; macroscopic experiments conducted on agar plates whereby the bulk motion of bacteria can be observed and microscopic experiments where bacteria are placed on a microscope slide and observed under an optical microscope to discern the behaviour and motility of individual bacterium.
In this section the results of the experiment are summarised with some suggestions for improvement and how the experiments would be changed if performed again.
