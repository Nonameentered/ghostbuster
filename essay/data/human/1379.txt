Corporate social responsibility has become a widely held buzzword in the business community for good corporate practices. However, it has also been the focus of debate on its very nature and theoretical justification. One of these criticisms is that corporate social responsibility sounds fine in theory but is unworkable in practice.
This article investigates the validity of this claim first by briefly looking at the nature of corporate social responsibility. Then, we undergo an in-depth analysis of the issues related to its implementation from a practical perspective, thereby identifying the limits of the concept and the obstacles to its realization. We conclude with an assessment of the workability of corporate social responsibility and argue that the current situation is rather disappointing.
It is important to have a clear picture of corporate social responsibility in mind at the outset. Unfortunately, the first and most notable feature of corporate social responsibility is the variety of its definitions
There are at least 25 different conceptual definitions of corporate social responsibility within academic literature. An alternate description is that corporate social responsibility is concerned with "the relationship between companies and society and in particular, with constraining the adverse impact of corporate activity on individuals and communities as a whole" In other words, while corporate social responsibility is generally about charity and stewardship from companies, there is no real consensus regarding its definition.
It is also important to bear in mind that the notion of corporate social responsibility is an evolving concept. The notion of corporate social responsibility evolved over the 20 Milton Friedman's famous critique emerged in the 1970s arguing that, on grounds based on economics and morality, there was no place for corporate social responsibility in businesses.
Nevertheless, one has to conceptualize corporate social responsibility as a philosophy for purposes of discussion. Corporate social responsibility is a collective name for many different activities that span a variety of disciplines and professional fields. The one agreed characteristic about corporate social responsibility is that it is voluntary.
Corporate social responsibility is also associated with ideas such as corporate philanthropy, corporate citizenship, sustainable development and stakeholder accountability. As will be seen in the following section, these facets of corporate social responsibility is directly related to the assessment of how practical is corporate social responsibility.
As mentioned above, corporate social responsibility is not without its detractors. Many arguments have already been put forwarded by critics, including Friedman's influential essay on economics and morality.
However, the greater, and perhaps more pragmatic, challenge of corporate social responsibility is concerned with its implementation. Corporate social responsibility sounds nice and dandy, but is it workable in practice? This boils down to the focus of this essay and the section that follows provides an in-depth analysis of the issues concerned with its implementation. The issues analyzed below relates to reasons for businesses to adopt corporate social responsibility, the issues related to the mechanics of implementation, the standards of corporate social responsibility, its assessment and its enforcement. As will be seen, there are significant obstacles towards the implementation of corporate social responsibility.
The first question is related to the fact that corporate social responsibility is voluntary. If corporate social responsibility is to be purely voluntary, the obvious concern is why would businesses adopt it? On the face of it, corporate social responsibility seems to run contrary to the fundamental premise on which businesses operate: profit generation.
A number of reasons have been put forward to establish the "business case" for corporate social responsibility.
However, moral behaviour is neither sufficient nor necessary for corporate success.
In other words, there is no firm incentive for businesses to adopt corporate social responsibility at all. Hence, it is doubtful whether corporate social responsibility programmes would be taken seriously.
The second issue concerns engagement of corporate social responsibility. How are businesses going to adopt it? Which corporate social responsibility activities should businesses engage in? How should managers and executives balance the strategic logic of social involvement with other, more tangible strategic investment projects? These are practical considerations that deserve further scrutiny.
We can start by looking at the mechanics of implementing corporate social responsibility. Basic instruments of corporate social responsibility may include values statements, codes of conducts or ethics, social reporting, auditing and certification.
One methodology available is Grayson & Hodges' seven-step model, which includes: identifying triggers, scoping what matters, making the business case, committing to action, integrating and gathering resources, engaging stakeholders, and measuring and reporting.
However, a widely held observation of the extent of corporate social responsibility adopted by businesses today is superficial rather than substantial.
Another issue related to practical implementation of corporate social responsibility is the lack of corporate social responsibility related management tools. Businesses utilize financial management tools to make decisions in allocating their resources, such as cash, time and personnel. Without better analytic tools to formulate corporate social responsibility decisions, managers could only resort to their personal common sense in making decisions. The lack of general principles will be highlighted when managers are faced with competing stakeholder interests.
The voluntariness of corporate social responsibility entails a further issue concerning the extent of corporate social responsibility to be adopted by businesses. Given the confusion and lack of consensus regarding corporate social responsibility, one must doubt whether there is an accepted standard of responsibilities. A general example may concern whether managers can substitute involvement in some corporate social responsibilities for lack of involvement in others.
The logical continuum is the assessment of corporate social responsibility. If corporate social responsibility is voluntary, businesses are to set up standards for themselves. Thus corporate social responsibility is effectively a self-regulating regime. The accountability of such arrangement is undoubtedly put into question.
While there is debate about the criteria against which corporate social and environmental performance should be assessed, there is little discussion about the underlying ideational and epistemological premise that acceptable behaviour can be itemised, measured and accounted for. Thus, there is real difficulty in quantifying business corporate social responsibility performance and public expectations.
The last issue that entails voluntariness is the lack of enforcement. Enforcement is not within the concept of corporate social responsibility. Since corporate social responsibility is a self-regulating regime, the only enforcement mechanism available is from the market itself. However, the only apparent enforcement against large corporations seems to be the harassment from NGOs and ratings agencies.
As can be seen, there are a number of obstacles that are in the way to implementing corporate social responsibility. To sum up our analysis, businesses have little reason to adopt corporate social responsibility programmes at all. The effectiveness of current implementation methods are yet to be seen. The know-how of implementing corporate social responsibility is arguably insufficient to effectuate corporate social responsibility in businesses. Without a consensus in the standards of corporate social responsibility and effective enforcement mechanism, the accountability of corporate social responsibility as a self-regulatory regime falls into question. Hence, the very features that define corporate social responsibility are also the same that undermines it.
Although corporate social responsibility undoubtedly has a normative appeal, the voluntariness of corporate social responsibility has led to serious accountability issues and the hypocrisy in its current implementation. In light of the above analysis, accusations that corporate social responsibility is unworkable are understandable from a practical perspective. When compounded with other criticisms of corporate social responsibility
Looking on the bright side, there may be a future for corporate social responsibility. The European Commission has aspirations for corporate social responsibility to contribute to making Europe "the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion" The UK government now has an "ambitious vision" to see corporate social responsibility take root in British businesses and has set out its own approach to corporate social responsibility values. Perhaps in the future, corporate social responsibility may be more workable in practice.
