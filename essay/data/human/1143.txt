Cirilo Villaverde (1812-94) was a Cuban writer and political activist, ardently anti-colonial and abolitionist, who experienced imprisonment and lengthy exile for his activism. His best-known novel He originally introduced her in 1839 in a twenty-five page tale that primarily attacked sexual licentiousness. But by his final draft in 1882, Villaverde meant for Cecilia to be interpreted as the embodiment of the national tragedy that was colonial, slave-holding Cuba in the 1830s. It is no coincidence that his protagonist shares his birth date of 1812 as well as initials. Born at the dawn of a brief constitutional period and the same year as the most serious slave uprising, Villaverde struggled throughout his life for a new Cuba. In her way, so did Cecilia. Villaverde's 'tragic mulatta' is far more complex than the conventional archetype of the fallen multiracial woman, who becomes depressed, mentally ill, or even suicidal, for engaging in interracial liaisons. Villaverde's narrative of Cecilia's life is his sophisticated illustration of the cause of his nation's ills, and deserves further inquiry. How far Cecilia is a 'tragic' figure with respect to her family life, her racial origin, her class position, her gender, and her sexual licentiousness will be examined (which were all, of course, intrinsically linked). Then it will be concluded as to whether Cirilo Villaverde intended for Cecilia Vald
As the novel begins with Cecilia's birth, we shall consider her family situation as the first element of her 'tragic' existence. She was conceived by forbidden interracial love rather than cruel exploitation, but Don C He was supportive at the birth, and exerted himself to ensure that his baby daughter would be baptised with the name Vald Cecilia's fate was controlled to a great extent by Don C Don C He was not able to protect his daughter from his son because of his own pride. With no father or mother, Cecilia lacked a meaningful disciplinarian or responsible nurturer. Her grandmother certainly was a positive role model and a moral voice, but her entreaties were largely empty threats, and she influenced Cecilia less and less as she grew older and past being afraid of stories, embracing isolation and religion instead of continuing to guide Cecilia. This somewhat 'careless upbringing' left the 'tragic mulatta' with a 'vagabond nature'. In the end, it is the Cuban establishment that saves Cecilia when the magistrate attempted to deter Don C Villaverde's portrait of Cuba as a wholly rotten society is not quite complete, then.
The incest, a traumatic theme found in most Cuban abolitionist literature, is central to Cecilia's relationships throughout the novel. Incest represents ultimate moral debasement of a society, but in this case it is not of the most abhorrent sort - that between parent and child - but between the more distant half brother and sister. The incest actually has a slightly positive element, if one follows Freud explanation of incest being a desire for sameness. The attraction of Cecilia and Leonardo is a natural expression of the equality of the races, and so is foundational to the Cuban nation. The reader is stirred to feel outrage at the treatment of slaves instead. Even her involvement in incest, then, does not render Cecilia a wholly tragic figure.
So Cecilia's origins are very damaging to her life chances, but her race is the deciding factor in her fate. Her appearance and legal status as a mulatta dictates her economic and social condition. For a slightly ruddy complexion and a few traces of kinkiness in her hair Cecilia is condemned to live subordinately to white Cubans - politically powerless, socially looked down upon, and economically worse off. Moreover, Jos These mulattos strongly identified with the master class, and looked on racial 'inferiors' with contempt. For example she is treated with more respect by men - the slave Aponte always addresses Cecilia as 'mistress', a title only afforded to white Cubans. On the other hand, Villaverde could have presented a more tragic figure than her if his protagonist had black skin, and therefore no social privileges at all instead.
Cecilia's fixation on 'whitening' herself and her future children could also strike the reader as tragic. The vast majority of mulattos, although probably fewer during the Of course Cecilia's grandmother quotes the infamous maxim, "one should rather the mistress of a white man than the wife of a black one." This inclination to secure a white man exposed mulattas (and black women) to manipulation and violation. Impossible love is tragic, but at least it involves genuine feeling. Mart She spurns a suitor more suited to her long-term happiness in favour of socially conditioned ideal partner, only to lose both. The greater tragedy for the author than Cecilia's ill-fated attempt to 'whiten' herself, however, is that she did not choose the counter-ideology of self-worth. In the white imagination, a mulatto making the last "step" to whiteness was not only improving his or her own race, but also produced tangible proof that the original sin of the white man or woman was redeemed.
Finally, gender implications that render Cecilia 'tragic' mainly concern how her beauty, and wanton behaviour are her downfall. The district commissioner describes Cecilia as being 'the girl who drives men crazy' She is the Little Bronze Virgin who is 'queen of the ball'. The reader is assured that Cecilia has no power over Leonardo when their future is concerned. She is unsuccessful at convincing him to stay for Christmas, She is not promiscuous to the extent of conventional racial stereotypes, but her skin colour and behaviour still expose Cecilia to public disapprobation. Her virtue is redeemed somewhat because Pimienta, the real hero, continues to love her after she has Leonardo's child.
In conclusion, there continues to be a discourse of debate over whether Villaverde achieved his goal of producing a realist novel. In gushing praise, Roberta Day Corbitt credits Villaverde with creating a photographic, rather than artistic, picture of every social class in Cuba. But As celebrated intellectual Jos Interracial encounters were so central to Cuban nationalism because it would only be possible to create a national identity by racial integration. Cecilia is not the conventional heroine more than she is not a wholly tragic figure. The most tragic element of Cecilia's life was that she lost the man she loved, but to the reader, her misguided attempt and failure to escape her position in Cuban society is more acute. If Villaverde had portrayed her as utterly desperate, he would effectively have been condemning his country to a state of abyss with no prospect of future improvement. Villaverde was a freedom fighter, an idealist, and so it is inconceivable that he would have presented such a bleak case for Cuba. Searching for other 'tragic mulatto' characters in the novel reveals that every figure has tragedy in their life. Cuban society in its entirety was experiencing tragedy as the result of Spanish colonial rule over national independence, and slavery over freedom. Doris Somner suggests, in fact, that the hero is Isabel. But her apathy is not conducive to progress, while Cecilia, with her illegitimate but whiter daughter, re-enters society after her confinement without the oppression of her white lover, and a more stable family - able to live and prosper in what will become the new Cuba.
