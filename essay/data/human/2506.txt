RSA is widely known and frequently used in public-key cryptography. It was invented in 1997 by three mathematicians: L.R.Rivest, A.Shamir and L.M.Adleman - professors from Massachussets Institute of Technology.
Cryptography is strictly associated with encryption and decryption. Encryption is the process of coding the plaintext into ciphertext, whereas decryption is the reverse process. Both of them need a key.
There are two types of cryptographic systems: using either secret-key (symmetric) or public-key (asymmetric). (Yan, S.Y., 2000)
When designing the system using public-key cryptography we must make sure, that computing the private-key from the public-key is infeasible. To achieve this we use sophisticated mathematics including one-way functions. One-way function is a very easy one to compute, but extremely difficult to invert. RSA algorithm, which uses this feature, is most frequently used in cryptography.
Security of RSA is based on difficulty in factorisation of large composite numbers.
