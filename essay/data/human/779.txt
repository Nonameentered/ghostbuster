This material selection report consists of two parts and will be focused on materials, shape and process selection with the use of the Cambridge Engineering Selector. In the first part A, there is a case study on fresh-water heat exchanger tubes material selection and it explains how judgement with the use of CES selector leads to The first part B will be another design study regarding process and material selection this time and will explain how judgement and decision with the help of CES selector affect our final choice on both process and material selection and appreciate the final selection-
Second Part concentrates on shape selection and tends to give reader an idea how secondary design factor M affects selection result. It also contrasts and compares each shape candidates' characteristics in order to obtain a final selection from a range of short listed shape. This report involves basic knowledge of CES selector and decision to identify the best candidate from a shortlist of candidates, which may have similar properties.
