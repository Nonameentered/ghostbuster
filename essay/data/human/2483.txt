A Petters ACI 7.2 bhp (5.4 kW) single cylinder diesel engine was tested under laboratory conditions running on both standard Diesel, and an alternative Rape Methyl Ester (R.M.E) 'Bio-Diesel' fuel. Various key parameters of the engine, run on these different fuels, such as mechanical efficiency, indicated thermal efficiency, brake thermal efficiency, specific fuel consumption and brake mean effective pressure were deduced by taking a series of measurements over a range of loads in order to then plot values on graphs.
