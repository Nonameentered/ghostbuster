The foundations of the group of historians now known as the Since this pivotal moment, the Trevor-Roper helpfully captures these elements of unity, emphasising their attempts to grasp the totality and cohesion of every historical period, their conviction that history is at least partly determined by forces which are external to man, and their determination to reduce areas of incomprehension by rigorous statistical analysis. Far from betraying this tradition, we can credit Braudel with furthering the principle for which the
Braudel led the  Indeed, Trevor-Roper affirms, 'no single book so amply and vividly illustrates, in its practice, the whole philosophy of the However, as Febvre himself notes, The book is a manifesto, a sign. And, I have no hesitation in saying so, it is a milestone." For Braudel did not follow the newer approaches to economic and social history embodied by Bloch's and Febvre's work, choosing not to refer to Bloch's innovative analyses of agricultural patterns of production, nor employing Febvre's idea that religious, literary, and cultural activity is coerced and guided by 'mental tools' characteristic of a given period. Anna Green and Kathleen Troup provide us with a useful synopsis,
Although Braudel thus ignored what seemed to many historians in the 1940s to be the most significant achievements of the first two editors of the
Febvre and Bloch rejected the near-monopoly of French history by political and diplomatic topics, an approach they condemned as 'sterile'; instead, they wanted to break down the boundaries between the human sciences, with historians incorporating as many of these disciplines as possible in their work. Using a metaphor of a searchlight, Bloch affirms that 'danger threatens only when each searchlight operator claims to see everything by himself, when each canton of learning pretends to national sovereignty." Such a metaphor propagates interdisciplinary collaboration. Febvre, furthermore, is in agreement,
For Febvre, collaboration therefore allowed the added benefits of scale and efficiency, the ability to approach questions and topics previously denied by their complexity, a solution to the task of writing Braudel, far from contradicting such a proposition, is in full agreement, arguing that 'each science encroaches on its neighbours, all the while believing it is staying in its own domain... but the crucial thing now is to get together." 'I would hope that the social sciences, at least provisionally, would suspend their constant border disputes over what is or is not a social science... rather let them try to trace those lines across our research, and make possible the first stages of some sort of coming together." The coming together of the different social sciences, sociology, history, and economics, therefore provides a unifying methodological approach to the
Although sometimes mocked and ridiculed for their overuse of quantification, statistical analysis and graphical representation, the Bloch, writing in With the belief that history is 'vastly indebted' to 'this great scientific effort', Bloch concludes that 'it has taught us to analyse more profoundly, to grasp our problems more firmly, and even, I dare to say, to think less shoddily." Indeed, Braudel is in agreement, and has helped to initiate a strong focus on quantitive history among the historians influenced by him. Braudel, by readily employing the
Although criticised for its omissions, such as culture, agriculture, law and religion, Braudel's Braudel, writing some years later, agrees with this notion,
It is this sense of purpose that provides the Braudel, writing his in his On the contrary. The password for the Furthermore, Braudel adds, 'and joined with that passion there was the search for And it is with this that we must judge Braudel's contribution to the
Trevor-Roper contends, 'French in origin, French in inspiration." Braudel, by asking 'is it by chance that Henri Berr, Lucien Febvre, March Bloch, and myself all four came from eastern France? That the Bryce Lyon asserts, their 'reaction is easy to explain... their memories of the Franco-Prussian War and of the German annexation of Alsace plus their involvement in the war of 1914-18 made them little receptive to German historical ideas." Their distinctive 'Frenchness' can therefore be explained by the context in which the With the belief that they study of history in France was in the doldrums, lagging far behind such study in Germany, England, and the United States, the

Interestingly, Lyon has recently asserted that had Bloch survived the Second World War, he would probably have repudiated the kind of history he had embraced between 1919-1939. Although it is difficult for us to satisfactorily investigate such an assertion, it does raise a number of important points. Firstly, if Bloch was willing to challenge his theoretical interpretations due to changing circumstance and personal experience, then context must be seen as an important factor governing the Secondly, flexibility, fluidity, and development are permitted attributes of the And thirdly, a clear goal and sense of purpose must be seen as driving the
In conclusion, we can therefore reject the notion that Braudel betrayed the Although we should credit the Rather, the Braudel's contribution to this 'tradition', although significant, and somewhat revolutionary, ought therefore, be placed within this wider tradition of conjectural fluidity and development. Far from betraying this tradition, we can credit Braudel with furthering one of the
