Pneumatics is about the study of the mechanical properties of air and other gases. During the laboratory, we need to create and test pneumatic circuits to meet the requirements of the 6 exercises. This report includes the pneumatic diagrams obtained during the laboratory and how pneumatic link with real-life application in an automated device. Also, advantages and disadvantages of using pneumatics instead of electrical actuators as well as the importance of the air quality supplied to the system will be discussed.
