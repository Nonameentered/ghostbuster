Discourse analysis can be broadly defined as the approach to the study of language which aims at investigating how spoken and written texts are organized in order to communicate messages in the social and cultural contexts in which they are produced (McCarthy and Carter, 1994). This interdisciplinary field of study enables analysts to develop models and methodologies to discuss issues of different nature, along the traditions of linguistics, sociology, philosophy, anthropology and others (Schiffrin, 1994).
In the essay, I shall concentrate on the analysis of a written text, the fairy tale ' Moreover, I shall make some considerations about the relations between certain structural devices and the narrative genre of popular tales for children.
Cohesion has been defined as the links among the parts of a text which make the text itself united and meaningful. Several types of cohesive devices ('ties' in Halliday and Hasan's (1976) terminology; 'links' in Hoey's (1991) more recent work) have been identified by scholars, who provided a complete taxonomy of the forms employed to hold texts together. In the analysis of the text, I will use the classification introduced by Halliday and Hasan (1976) in their pioneering study on cohesion in English.
The authors identify two main categories of cohesive devices: the grammatical forms and the lexical forms. The former is made up of four subgroups (
An alternative perspective to investigate lexical cohesion is embodied in the notions of Particularly interesting is the whole range of expressions used to refer to the main character of the story, made up of synonyms, near-synonyms and general noun phrases which alternate according to the features of the context in which the character appears (see appendix 3).
Instances of similarity chains are the numerous expressions used to develop literary themes throughout the text: the
Identity and similarity chains are useful means not only for textual cohesion, but also to create coherence, a property of texts which is strongly related to the receiver's comprehension of the message. The main conditions needed for a text to be perceived as coherent by the readers involve the recognition of the genre, the competence about its organization and functions, the shared knowledge of the content and the context in which it has developed.
According to Halliday and Hasan (1985) the semantic grouping in similarity chains is genre-specific. This is evident in the themes presented above, which can be considered typical of fairy tales and popular stories. Furthermore, elements such as
In this section, I shall move from the micro level of grammatical and lexical cohesive devices to the macro level of clause and sentence relations in order to point out certain structural parallelisms that contribute to hold the text together. The prospective adopted follows the one proposed by Hoey (2001), who provides a model to analyse texts based on the meaning relations between clauses and recursive structural patterns.
The story '
The three phases of the plot, although involving different characters and situations, are structured in a similar way. Firstly, all of them have an introductory statement, which helps to collocate the situations in time and space (even if in an imaginary settings). The introduction at the beginning is longer and more elaborated, since it presents the main character and explains a fundamental point for the comprehension of the whole story: how the man received the gift of understanding the language of animals.
Secondly, in the three sub-stories the 'recycling' of a pattern can be identified. The sequence The patterns are not distributed in an even and plain way, but create a climax in the story, which increases in terms of frequency and complexity towards the end of the tale (see appendix 4).
Finally, other interesting patterns develop more locally to serve both stylistic and cohesive functions through the repetition of the structure of the clauses. Winter (1994) proposes two groups of clauses: An example of the first type is the sequence
In the brief analysis presented above some of the properties of cohesion and coherence have been described in relation to a written fairy tale. Several strategies are employed to hold the text together on both the micro- and the macro-structural levels. Grammatical and lexical devices, such as pronominal reference, conjunction, ellipsis and sense relations among words establish effective links between the parts of the text, whereas, at the macro-level of clauses and sentences, it is the recursive pattern of sequences logically and temporally ordered that is responsible for the cohesion. Furthermore, there seems to be an interrelation between the linguistic level (here intended as lexical and grammatical structures) and the genre of fairy tales which the text belongs to. The several strategies exploited not only contribute to the cohesion of the text, but they also help to make it coherent, developing the story with attention to the genre, the audience (mainly children) and the moral message expressed. The recognition of the genre by the reader and his or her competence about the organization and functions of the text are in fact necessary conditions for the creation of a coherent piece of narrative.
