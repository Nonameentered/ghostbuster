This assignment is about discussion and application of production planning and control system knowledge by two different cases. Section one concludes and explains the strategy and objectives which used in simulation of module games. Then it discusses EOQ application for the game and finally produces MPS and material ordering plan for next 10 weeks. Section two concerns with forecasting approaches for two different type of customer's demand in an automotive components manufactory' and finally it analyzes existing and potential capacity choices for increasing demand.
The assignment focuses on production planning and control system theories and applies them into practical two cases. The first one case uses approaches which involves in EOQ' MPS and material ordering plan to analyze strategies and objectives' and then simulate more periods in module simulation games. The section two emphasizes on the methods about forecasting and capacity measures for an assumption of automotive components company. All the analysis and discussion need to be further studied and investigate when used in realistic circumstance.
