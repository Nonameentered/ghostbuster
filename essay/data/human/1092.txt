A Michelson Interferometer, calibrated using a He-Ne laser, was used to observe the fringe pattern of Na, Hg and white light. It was shown that Na light is consistent of two wavelengths with a separation: This was used to determine the position of zero optical path difference. Here white light fringes were observed and used to determine the coherence length of white light; It was shown using a Fourier Transform method that the characteristic wavelengths, and their relative abundances, of the Mercury emission spectrum could be found. Unfortunately the data was not accurate enough to directly determine the coherence length of the mercury lamp. By observation of fringes in the He-Ne laser spectrum as various gases, He, N, Ar, CO
The Michelson Interferometer, shown in Figure 1, is commonly regarded as one of the most significant pieces of scientific apparatus of the last century. Whilst it has lead to great discoveries in many fields, most famously in relativity, here it has been used to study the spectra of a variety of light sources and the refractive indices of various gases
The Michelson Interferometer, shown schematically in Figure 1, works by splitting light in two (by amplitude If necessary light entering B can be focussed to infinity and light reaching the detector can be focussed to as sharp a point as possible using lenses as in Figure 1. M1 can be moved towards or away from B using a geared micrometer operated by a motor. The horizontal and vertical tilt of M2 can be controlled using screws. The beam of light travelling towards M2 passes through a Compensation Plate (C), a block of glass of the same optical thickness as B, such that upon recombination at B both beams have travelled the same optical distance for optimum interference. The detector is a photo-detector of variable gain, detecting photo intensity, linked via an ADC to a computer.
