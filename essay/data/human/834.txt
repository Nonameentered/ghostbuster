 They are often asymptomatic but patients can experience dyspnoea and a pleuritic chest pain. Transudates are due to an increase in venous pressure (such as from cardiac failure, constrictive pericarditis or fluid overload). Exudates are most likely due to an increase in the leakiness of pleural capillaries secondary to malignancy, infection or inflammation.
 Recurrent slowly resolving pneumonias are also a common feature.

Trauma-related; rib fracture:
 PEs usually arise from a venous thrombosis in the pelvis or legs. Clots break off and pass through the venous system and the right side of the heart before lodging in the pulmonary circulation.
On physical examination, a full respiratory examination will be carried out; assessment of respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, breath sounds (bronchial breathing is often heard in pleural effusions). Listening to air entry and the presence of added sounds; crackles indicating infection or wheezes suggestive of airways disease. It is also important to look for signs of trauma and palpate for tenderness over the chest wall, which would be present if there was a rib fracture. An overall examination of Mr
On general examination, Mr There were Mr Capillary refill <2 seconds.
Following examination, the most likely diagnosis for Mr The effusion could also be complicated by a chest infection suggested by the crackles heard on examination. The pleural effusion will need to be aspirated and sent for histology to determine whether it is an exudate or a transudate fluid. Exudative effusion (protein >30g/dL) can be caused by infection or malignancy. Malignant cells can be seen on cytology. It is important to rule out a malignancy as a cause for the effusion and Mr
 Since his chest pain started he has been finding it more difficult to carry out his usual tasks of daily living. His difficulty breathing also makes mobilising more difficult.
