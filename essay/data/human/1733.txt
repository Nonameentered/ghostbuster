In The following table is an annotated action plan for my future development of these key characteristics with the identified current issues being confidence, self-esteem, self-consciousness and difficulty in 'saying no'. I have chosen to focus on these 4 areas as I feel they are inextricably linked to my confidence and therefore need to be addressed together. The action plan identifies how I feel I can improve and develop these areas, integrates relevant literature and includes a schedule for review. I believe the goals I have set are SMART as they are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and timely. I also feel my objectives are achievable within the remainder of this academic year and hope that by focusing on these areas I will be able to enhance my personal and professional development.
