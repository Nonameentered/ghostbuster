Bertolt Brecht's His portrayal of crime and justice in the play can be contrasted with those of Fritz Lang's film Lang acknowledged the influence of Brecht as an author and director when he himself directed In reality, such was Brecht's influence that it would have been virtually impossible not to have been during this epoch of German film and literature. However, Whilst Yet despite these competing authorial intentions, parallels can be drawn between the treatment of the paramount theme of crime and justice.
The protagonists of the two works occupy different criminal spheres, both in terms of the nature of the illegalities and of the victims claimed. In ' Brecht suggests that 'crooked dealing necessarily entails violence." This is evident when Arturo Ui's offer to Dogsborough of 'protection' is declined but then promptly accepted due to his intimidation after the murder of a witness at the official enquiry.
The underlying criminal motivations suggested in the two works provide an additional source of comparison. In He contorts his visage and this directly emulates what he would look like to the authorities who brand him as insane. Here the 'double perspective literalises Beckert's split personality' This particular eighteen second long shot is further significant in that the murderer self-examines himself and this provokes the reader's empathy which will become increasingly evident throughout the film. He repeatedly experiences periods of physical and mental distress, highlighted by his unease as he watches the child picked up by her mother. His anxiety is reinforced by the cognac which he purchases from the caf His facial contortion is disturbing and this is mirrored in the music accompaniment which Lang includes in this sequence (51.20). In Arturo Ui wants to control the vegetable trade in Chicago and charge the sellers for his protection against rival vegetable dealers. This idea is initially rejected but Ui manages to persuade them and he eventually rules the protection in Chicago and Cicero. The play ends with his ambitions for further domination symbolising Hitler's dangerous ardor for expansionism: ' Detroit! Toledo! Pittsburg!... Charleston! Und New York! '
Yet although these motives differ in the two works, the underlying contemporary social and economic conditions are attributing factors in the crimes. Both Lang and Brecht suggest that it is almost inevitable that such situations will arise in Germany in the 1930s. Lotte Eisner argues that in a crop of mass murderers." It is likely that Beckert had a traumatic experience during the First World War as 'in his 1930 work journal, Lang recorded an idea for a scene in
In The opening of the play speaks of ' ' and the situation is ' ' ' In this capacity when 'the vegetable market... is shown in the grip of the depression' ' However, it is controvertible whether gangsterism as a denouement can 'adequately describe Nazism and its atrocities' It is only fair to note, however, that Brecht would surely have changed the subject or style of his play had it been written post-war when the full nefariousness caused by the Nazi war machine was realised.
In Brecht's play and Lang's film, it is evident that the treatment of the crimes extends beyond merely labelling them as infamies, as extenuating circumstances are provided in both. The social and economic difficulties in In In the mirror scene with the child, he experiences feelings of lust, before being recognised and chased. His nervous, agitated, frightened expressions indicate that he is not a sadistic, natural killer, but a character defined by his struggle against his malign side. Lang uses cinematic technique to express the murderer's discomfort as he browses the shop window and the 'manically moving objects' When he sees the mother come to the child he panics and hides in the shop window clutching his chest.
Lang depicts Beckert's necessity to kill through images such as that of the infant's reflection in the mirror, which is disturbed by the position of the knives that face invitingly inwards in order to highlight his temptation. The murders themselves, however, are not visualised, with Lang using other techniques to portray the occurrences. This is initially employed at the opening of the film when Elsie Beckmann's mother is searching for her following her disappearance. Lang uses dramatic irony, enabling the audience to view the sinister enticement scene in which it becomes evident that Elsie is to be murdered. In this episode, the shadow of the murderer appears on his wanted poster as he says to Elsie: ' The murder is seen in the form of Elsie's absence; as Frau Beckmann calls her daughter Lang instils a montage of shots; the first of which is looking from the top of the block of flats down the staircase. The staircase is desolate and the geometric, hypnotic pattern of this image emphasises its emptiness and that Elsie is nowhere to be found. Lang then introduces shots of the garage, her empty place at the dinner table which is laid waiting for her, a barren field into which the ball she was previously playing with rolls out of the shrub and settles in the straggling undergrowth and finally a balloon trapped in the overhead power cables. The latter two of these images relate directly to Elsie as her personal possessions are shown. The former two also suggest places where she might usually be found. What is particulary powerful in this sequence is Lang's use of silence; we hear nothing; save the frantic, erratic calls from the worried Frau Beckmann, and this makes the scene more dramatic. Indeed, the vociferations themselves coupled with her distressed visage serve to uniquely intensify the drama as well. The result, therefore, is that the gruesome details of the murder are left to the viewer's own imagination and this effect is 'incomparably more impressive than if we had seen the deed itself in all its details." Lang wrote of the death that it would be difficult not to sicken the audience because of the nature of the crime and therefore, only gave hints. He wanted to 'make the audience an integral part in the creation of this special scene by forcing each individual member of the audience to create... the murder according to his personal imagination." Other visions of phsical violence come in the 'court' room scene where Beckert tries to escape but needs to be physically restrained and where the 'mob' tie up the guards as they search the building where Beckert becomes trapped and needs to hide in.
In When Ted Ragg - a journalist speaks out against Ui and his associates, saying that ' There are many examples of violent crime which sometimes involve death such as Sheet's 'suicide' and the murder of Sheet's accountant Bowl. This incident is carried out behind closed doors but the shots are heard by the audience and it is clear that Ui is responsible. Arguably the most graphic murder in the play is that of Roma by Givola and his men as ' ' a man he has known and trusted for many years. The fact that - as Givola fires at Roma and his men - he is described as '
If Arturo Ui is taken as the main perpetrator in Brecht's play then it is possible to compare and contrast the portrayal of his personality with that of Beckert. It is important to dispel the common myth that 'Lang's murderer... is based neither on Haarman nor on K Peter K Fritz 'the butcher of Hannover' Haarman was a serial killer who sold his victims as meat to his neighbours. Whilst Beckert wrestles with his conscience in an attempt to defeat his alternative criminal personality, Lang gives the sense that he is somewhat hindered by the pressures placed on him by society. Brecht hints that Arturo Ui genuinely wants to be relatively lawful and values virtues such as loyalty and honesty, even if this is only apparent amongst his own. This may seem somewhat ironical as Brecht was, of course, extremely anti-Hitler and 'nothing mattered more to Brecht than the sense of participating in the fight against [him]'
The main contrast between the portrayals of crime and justice in In Lang's film this becomes obvious in his characterization of Beckert. It is clear that Lang did not want to stereotype his murderer - 'a brutish type with bushy eyebrows' In the film Lang uses very few lighting effects to maintain this realism and there are many examples where the film has the appearance of actual newsreels to add to the authenticity. It is necessary for Brecht to make the reader laugh at the atrocities carried out by Ui and his associates as this forms his critique of fascism. The play is an allegory of fascism and the vegetable dealers symbolise Germany and its acceptance of the mythical law and order that the Nazis championed. In the play the greengrocers accept Ui's 'offer' for protection after the 'warehouse has been burned down at his [Ui's] orders." By exposing Arturo Ui and his fellow criminals to laughter Brecht ridicules the concept of fascism. It is necessary, therefore, for the crimes to be exaggerated and 'this world of mobsters, machine guns and melodramatic menace is essential for the play's satire." One particulary amusing example is in the 'court' scene where Hook - a wholesale vegetable dealer - replies to the judges question of ' ' saying ' This is a malaise of justice, yet it is more damning for Brecht to subject the mobster to ridicule than it is to treat them with respect as 'they [the Nazis] are by no means great political criminals, but the perpetrators of great political crimes, which is something completely different.'
Brecht further parodies the gangsters and their crimes and justice in ' ' These speeches are 'used to expose the vacuity and moral and spiritual mediocrity of a "gangster-hero" - Hitler - to denude him of that aura of heroism and greatness which attach in the popular imagination to murderers and criminals who commit acts of epic proportions." When Ui makes a speech to the vegetable traders of Chicago and Cicero he begins with ' Freunde! Mitb ' Another example is in Givola's flower shop where the dyads of Givola and Dulfeet and Betty and Ui appear alternately. This is symbolic of the garden scene in Goethe's ' Ui: [ The rhyming pattern throughout is another example of elevated verse undertaken by Ui and Givola. As in Shakespeare's
As in Nazi Germany the general public just seem to accept the gang's 'laws' in ' Such is Ui's corruption of her that she continues ' In This is best shown when a little girl stops a man in the street to ask what time it is; the elderly man merely gives the reply and then shows concern explaining: ' It is not long before the melee intensifies and the man finds himself looking up having to explain himself to a policeman before being arrested after frantic calls from the flustered public. Lang uses the camera to reflect society looking down on the man who looks as small as he does in the eyes of the accusing public. Herrn Jager's house must be searched just because of an anonymous tip off and this follows a plethora of false reports and the subsequent imbroglio is difficult for the police to deal with. This is perhaps best shown when the two men argue with the police officer over the colour of the girl's ' There are also fifteen dissonant reports about the route taken by Elsie on her way home. The result of this is that as 'there is no such thing as a murderer's visage... [and] every man on the street... is under suspicion of being the child murderer." The problem here, again is that ' '
The leitmotiv of justice can be compared in the play and the film with reference to the scenes of the 'court'. When Fish tells the judge in They constantly dispraise and ' He then is beaten up and revokes his statement. Brecht makes a complete mockery of the Nazi judicial system here with even the judge ' This form of 'mock' justice is present in The public have made this themselves as they do not have faith in the government judiciary system and Beckert's pleas to be handed over to the police fall on deaf ears. Their justification for this is that he will merely have to claim insanity and will be spared. This shows a strong aversion to the justice of the state. Lang hints that this public court is not just either, however, as it is made up of criminals who are described as ' Indeed, it is particulary ironic that the chairman who sentences him to death, stating that ' ' The court it would seem 'are not interested in truth or justice, but the elimination of an outsider so that they can resume their illegal activities' The question which Lang raises here is that of whether it is morally right to seek retribution if a collective confidence in the state does not exist. What is certainly unjust in this sequence is that the jurors are almost like an audience at the theater, the camera moves around them and cries can be heard from the other people in the court calling for the death penalty.
Whereas in When the note which Beckert writes to the press is examined by the graphology expert the 'camera is deliberately immobile to stress the rigid milieu." Earlier on in the film as the police are trying to solve the case there are endless files and documents which they search through. These documents attempt to 'make up' the person they are looking for. Lang hints that these are somewhat unnecessary and this is best highlighted by the fact that it is the public who actually catch Beckert first. The police are depicted somewhat negatively and they clash with the public during their quest to catch the murderer. The public have no respect for the police as they raid public buildings and because they have orders to suspect everyone, check all identification. The public, therefore, through their use of the beggars catch up with Beckert first and it would seem that Lang is perhaps suggesting that if these two forces had worked in unison it would have been much easier to reach - what is in reality a common goal. The shots of the devastation caused in the building that has been searched by the mob and of the guards having to be tied up indicates strongly that another preferable way should have been found.
Thus, it can be concluded that, during an era defined by economic and socio-political upheaval, both works are primarily concerned with the issues of crime and justice. In Conversely, Lang uses the medium of film to depict a more sinister portrayal of an individual's mental turmoil whilst simultaneously being conditioned by these social influences. The focus on punishment produces a greater dichotomy between the oeuvres, with Brecht suggesting the impermeability of 'gang culture' whose influence extends beyond the law, whilst Lang highlights the stigmatization of an individual persecuted by society.
