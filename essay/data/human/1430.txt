Embryogenesis of In this review, the early embryogenesis of
In
In (Figure 13) These cells contain maternally loaded P granules, which contain proteins implicated in RNA binding. The ability to determine germline fate is mainly possessed by two genes:
Four Notch pathways are involved in (Figure 20) The first two, which are described here, are mediated extensively by maternally-expressed GLP-1/Notch, the other two require LIN-12/Notch (and less GLP-1/Notch).
Embryogenesis in Embryogenesis employs a variety of intrinsic factors as well as intercellular signaling pathways, such as the PAR proteins for the initial axis set up and maintaining, SKN-1 for the inducing of the pharynx and intestine cell fate, PIE-1 and MEX-1 involved in determining somatic and germline lineage. As well as the Notch pathway mediated by GLP-1 in AB descendents. All of these distinct, while interrelated, processes that are crucial for the correct development of the
