The right to silence is a prominent feature of adversarial justice systems and is often erroneously viewed as a single entitlement The right to silence is in reality a collection of privileges; with the most important being the right of a suspect to remain silent under accusation or interrogation and the right of a suspect not to have to testify at his own trial.
The right to silence derives from the privilege against self-incrimination The judiciary have recognised the privilege as being " However, as Lord Mustill indicated, "
There is a clear tension between trying to strike a balance between protecting the defendant's established privilege against self-incrimination and the need for the courts to obtain the necessary information in order to convict criminals. Prior to 1994 the judiciary became increasingly reluctant to allow the defendant to thwart the prosecution case through silence, especially in civil matters The legislature reacted to this and other stimuli, especially the prevalent use of silence by suspected terrorists in Northern Ireland
The CJPOA disposed of the absolute right to silence and allowed, for the first time, courts to draw adverse inferences from a defendant's silence. The most important limitation of the right to silence, and the focus of this essay, is section 34 CJPOA which allows an inference to be drawn if the defendant, " The rationale behind section 34 is that it is expected that an innocent individual would wish to provide his exculpatory explanation at the first opportunity. If he fails to do this the jury should be allowed to draw adverse inferences from his later fabrication, which is little more than an attempt to ambush the prosecution and ensure an unmerited acquittal.
However, even prior to the CJPOA the " For example, in cases where a person is accused of a crime by another speaking to him on even terms, then he ought to reply to that accusation, and " The judge was also able to comment, although The judge could further draw the attention of the jury to the fact that the defendant's silence in court has " It is evident, that in reality, prior to the CJPOA, the right to silence did not exist in absolute form and both common law and statutes
Many commentators were heavily opposed to the introduction of adverse inferences, especially as the right to silence had already been significantly undermined. O'Reilly argued that, " This essay shall examine whether, following the introduction of the CJPOA, and the resulting jurisprudence, the legislation has successfully achieved its goal and whether a defendant is in a substantially more disadvantaged position.
In February, I wrote to Snaresbrook Crown Court to ask if I could be a Marshal with a Crown Court judge for three days at the end of March. I was told that this would be possible and I was assigned to Judge I sat with Judge I saw the summing up of
I had decided, prior to sitting with Judge The summing up of
At this point I consulted It was very helpful in providing an outline of the way in which the right to silence had changed and its impact on defendants. I also consulted journals referred to at the bottom of the lecture handout and in the footnotes of These included These provided me with an interesting discussion on the policy issues surrounding the abolition of the absolute right to silence.
Through research, I realised that since the Criminal and Public Order Act 1994 the right to silence has been divided into pre-trial silence, and silence during the trial. I wished to focus on the relationship between the state as prosecutor and the citizen as defendant, so I decided to focus solely on the issue of pre-trial silence.
I then interviewed Judge The interview with Judge
I used the University of I found the following journals of particular use , , , These further elucidated the general principles and scope of s34 and provided me with some useful analysis of cases.
I then completed the essay.
