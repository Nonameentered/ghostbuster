The first human colonisation of Cyprus has been a much debated topic in recent archaeological discourse particularly since the excavations at Akrotiri Aetokremnos provided dates of human activity several millennia earlier than previous research had shown (Simmons 1991: 863). Further discoveries of Early Pre-Pottery Neolithic sites such as Parekklisha Shillourokambos and Kissonerga Mylouthkia provide evidence for 'colonisation' rather than just 'visitation' which, when studied in the wider context of the island and the surrounding mainland, aid in understanding the process of colonisation not only in Cyprus but also for the Mediterranean islands in general.
The following discussion is divided into three sections preceded by a semantic explanation of terms used to describe the stages of colonisation. Part 1 presents the archaeological evidence from Cyprus with reference to key sites, the locations of which are shown in figure 1. The question of the origins of these first settlers is addressed in the second section through the observation of similarities in material culture and technology from sites in the Levant and Anatolia. The third part explores the process of colonisation in the context of Cyprus but also within the general theoretical framework of island colonisation.
Before embarking on a discussion about the evidence for the colonisation of Cyprus, it is important to define exactly what is meant by 'colonisation' and to distinguish it from other terms such as 'visitation' or 'occupation'. Although all three terms can be used to describe human presence on the island, each one encompasses different types of human activity and permanence of settlement as reflected in the material remains. Cherry defines occupation to be when "an island has become for one or more groups the principal provider of its subsistence requirements and the focus of its residential pattern throughout the year" (1981:48) in comparison to 'utilisation' which is associated with seasonal or short-term visits for the purpose of exploiting the natural resources, and for accidental or unsuccessful colonisation (1990:198).
It is proposed here that there are three stages for discussion in the colonisation of the Mediterranean islands: 'visitation'; 'occupation'; and 'colonisation', not all of which will necessarily be represented on every island. Outlined here are the definitions as used in this study. 'Visitation,' which is based on Cherry's classification of 'utilisation' (ibid.), refers to short and seasonal visits primarily (though not necessarily solely) for the exploitation of island resources. The term 'visitation,' with its connotations of brevity and impermanence, is preferred to 'utilisation' since the exploitation of resources may have been equally important during periods of occupation and colonisation. 'Accidental' and 'unsuccessful' colonisation are excluded from this category since a certain amount of inference is required to surmise whether colonisation was intentional or accidental or whether acquisition of resources was the only objective when visiting an island. It has been cited that the export of domesticates to islands can be taken as evidence of deliberate colonisation (Cherry 1990:198) but this excludes explorations prior to domestication and those groups reliant on a hunter-gatherer subsistence strategy. This theory also precludes alternative methods of the transportation of domesticates such as trade and exchange networks.
'Occupation' as defined by Cherry can be split into two categories, 'occupation' and 'colonisation', both of which suggest a certain level of permanence of settlement and year-round habitation with the island supplying all subsistence resources. Where they differ is in long-term continuity of settlement. 'Colonisation' is the final stage where humans finally inhabit and populate an island without withdrawal due to insufficient resources or unviable population while 'occupation' is the preceding phase in this process, perhaps lasting only a few generations but is then unsuccessful or abandoned resulting in a discontinuity of settlement.
