Observing the images presented by other groups on the BA case by Sullivan-Taylor (2005), I couldn't help notice the similarities between my group's image, Orchestrating Knowledge (OK), with Process, Power and Change (PPC).
OK criticizes the simplistic tradition of looking at the HQ as a rational resource allocator that ignores how it conducts its relationships with its environment (McGee, 2003 p.147). The PPC image meanwhile analyzes the contexts, process and content of change and the iterative interaction between these spheres (Pettigrew, 2003 p.312). Both images constantly remind us that strategy doesn't always mysteriously appear out the minds of consultants and senior management.
Consider BA, which had transformed itself from being a Lion Tamer to becoming a Leader and finally a Mentor (in OK-speak). A lot of this change was caused by BA's self-awareness of its position in the industry and by the realization of the role played by 'lower' employees in formulating strategy.
Earlier in the case, BA was painted to be a bureaucratic, impersonal and with a commandeering centre. By the end of the case, BA was painted as a self-conscious, listening, honest and innovative airline. The evidence in this case supports the implications of both the OK and PPC images that recognize the usefulness of an emergent type of strategy.
The dynamic and iterative interaction between context and process can be analysed using both images.
