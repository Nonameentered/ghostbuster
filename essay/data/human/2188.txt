Trypsin is a major protease or proteolytic enzyme - endopeptidase in the duodenum of the human alimentary canal. It catalyses protein digestion and results in peptides.

In this practical, TI is extracted from defatted soyabean meal and incubated under standard conditions (standard - without TI, heated and unheated TI) therefore used to determine
TIA shows the amount (mg) of pure trypsin inhibited per gram of sample. The
The anomalous inhibition percentage of heated samples is due to high anomalous HSaB absorbance value = 0.095). However, TIAs are more reliable in this case to show that heated samples have a lower TIA value than unheated ones. Despite it is expected to be much lower than 49.3mg/g sample because of the denatured and inactivated TI, thus no inhibition, unless, there is another protein inhibitor: "there are two types of these (protein) inhibitors (Kunitz trypsin inhibitor and bowman-birk inhibitor)" in soyabeans
