Lower respiratory tract infection
Left Ventricular Failure/Congestive Cardiac Failure
On physical examination, it is important to assess the level of Mrs Her vital signs should be assessed, particularly her oxygen saturations and blood gases. An examination should assess her cardiovascular and respiratory status, listening for crackles and air entry.
On general examination, Mrs She did She would Mrs There were Mrs
GCS - Motor response 5/6 (localising response to pain), Verbal response 2/5 (incomprehensible speech), Eye opening 3/4 (eye opening in response to speech) = 10/15
History and examination confirm the initial possible causes of Mrs A collapse secondary to an infective exacerbation of COPD leading to Type II respiratory failure and CO2 retention is the most likely diagnosis. Her O Tachycardia, confusion, drowsiness and central cyanosis all support this diagnosis. The presence of crackles bilaterally would indicate a possible respiratory tract infection which may have precipitated Mrs
 She has had repeated falls, one of which she was admitted for. She is becoming progressively more unsteady on her feet. This is putting her at increase risk of further falls and consequently reducing her physical state further. As a result of her COPD, Mrs Her immobility increases the risk of retaining respiratory secretions predisposing Mrs

 She gets full-time care from her nursing home and requires help dressing, washing and some support mobilising.

Respiratory failure occurs when there is an inadequate gas exchange, which results in hypoxia (pO Respiratory failure is subdivided into two types according to the pCO
 It is primarily caused by a ventilation/perfusion mismatch.
 It is caused by alveolar hypoventilation with or without ventilation/perfusion mismatch. (1)
The management of respiratory failure includes the administration of supplemental oxygen, the control of secretions, the treatment of any underlying pulmonary infection, the control of any bronchospasm and measures to limit pulmonary oedema.
The management principles are:
treat the underlying disease
physiotherapy
oxygen therapy - try to maintain pO
bronchodilators and steroids if there is airways obstruction
in some circumstances, respiratory stimulants such as i.v. doxapram 1-4 mg / min, may be indicated if the pCO
if arterial O
long-term management should be aimed at the underlying cause of the condition e.g. COPD
An important issue raised in this case was the issue of resuscitation in the event of a cardiac arrest. Mrs On previous occasions her family had been notified that it was difficult to predict whether she would recover. On her admission this time, Mrs This case highlighted the issues of health care delivery to patients who may not benefit from further medical intervention and how to approach this issue with the family. Mrs The decision was taken not to resuscitate in the event of a cardiac arrest on the basis of a reduced quality of life.
