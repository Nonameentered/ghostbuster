This report reviewed the role of English Nature as a government agency concerning nature conservation. The functions of English Nature are diverse, while there are many challenges to achieve its targets particularly on the status of the designated areas and the action implementation of Biodiversity Action Plans, a lot of efforts has been put into effective coordination of works.
