This report outlines a digital filtering solution which performs a 3 A model of the system, including ADC/DAC has been produced using Matlab and Simulink. Using this model the step, impulse and frequency responses of the system have been plotted, and verified. The system has been tested with real audio, and C code for the filter has been created.
The work presented here is a digital filtering solution for the company's recently prototyped speech compression system. It is a 3
Filters such as the above are very commonplace, and easy to design using the process outlined in this report.
Listening to the output of the filter through headphones clearly demonstrates that this filtering solution is not perfect. However, it is a compromise between performance and complexity. Due to the simplicity of the C code required, this filtering solution can be added in to DSP processor in the prototype without changing the hardware at all. This is very important in reducing design and manufacturing costs.
The filter designed here only attenuates the high frequencies which are not required in speech. However, these frequencies are most harsh on the human ear, and the benefit is instantly noticeable.
