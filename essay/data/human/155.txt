Higher plants and algae use various mechanisms to concentrate CO The three key concentrating mechanisms C The mechanisms relate directly to the environment in which they live: C Each has evolved over time in various species each with the environmental conditions in common.
Rubisco has poor affinity for CO In normal atmospheric conditions Rubisco operates at below 30% of its capacity. To improve this C O It is therefore vital that plants can increase the concentration of CO This essay will look at the mechanisms and significance in relation to the environment of three plant groups that use varying methods of this CO The three mechanisms are C
C They concentrate CO
CO2 fixation.
Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) is carboxylated in the mesophyll cells to form oxaloacetate, which is converted to a C Atmospheric CO Rubisco does not interfere because of the spatial separation of it in the bundle sheath cells. PEP carboxylase is not unique to C
C4 acid transported to bundle sheath cells
This detected CO It moves compartment via an ATP-driven carbon dioxide pump in which two ATP molecules are transferred per CO2
C4 acid decarboxylation
If the C4 acid is malate, this is carried out my malic enzyme, generating a C In the Calvin cycle Ribulose uses CO
PEP regeneration, and therefore the autocatalytic nature of the process is only possible because the two cycles are involved, the C
PEP regeneration consumes two ATP equivalents per CO The total energy required to fix one CO This is a higher energy demand than required by C
The C It was discovered in tropical grasses (2) and is now known to consist of 17 higher family plants, and includes many important crop species including maize and sugarcane (both Graminae) (1). The plants vary considerably and indicate that the mechanism evolved multiple times in different species. They are found primarily in hot, dry environments and predominate in tropical grasslands covering 15% of the earth's vegetated surface, and, despite the small number of species are responsible for about 18% of the global terrestrial photosynthesis (1). They predominate in these locations as the process minimises water loss and photorespiration compared to that in C Photorespiration rate is shown to be low unless the intercellular [CO Both of these factors enable C Because of the high activity of PEP carboxylase, C The suppression of photorespiration by the high concentration of CO
Some plants have been observed to have properties between those of C3 and C4 plants depending on their natural environments (2).
Many plants that exist in environments with a short water supply undergo Crassulacean Acid Metabolism, which is a CO The first recognition of CAM was that succulent plants tasted more bitter (malic acid) in the morning then the evening (15), initially by the Romans, and formally described in the early nineteenth century by de Saussure (16), and Heyne (whom it was named after(13))(17). The diversity of these drought exposed species from the common Cactaceae and Euphorbiaceae, and tropical epiphytes to the two ferns suggests that, like the C
In cyanobacteria and microalgae, Rubisco has a particularly low affinity for CO To increase the CO
Microalgae cannot stop the CO They need therefore to have cell walls that can prevent the leakage of CO
To do this, firstly these organisms accumulate HCO The cells take up both CO The HCO It is thought that Rubisco is packaged into the cell at a specific location within the chloroplast of the cell, and the action of carbonic anhydrase then quickly generates higher CO This has been observed by an increase in CA activity in multiple compartments upon induction of CCM. This specific chloroplast location is the pyrenoid, which is a structure specific to the chloroplasts of certain algae and hornworts (6). The CO
Secondly cyanobacteria and microalgae are effective at scavenging CO It is thought that the peculiar internal structure of microalgae such as the localization of rubisco in the pyrenoid, the starch envelope and the concentric thylakoid membranes contribute to the effective CCM and low amount of CO
The gene responsible for the transcription factor controlling this apparatus is only induced in low CO
The result of this CO It also costs the cell one extra ATP molecule (1).
It can be seen be looking at three major mechanisms how plants overcome the problem of Rubisco having a low affinity to CO All three of the mechanisms work to concentrate CO
The structure is vital to each type of mechanism. In C CAM plants have features supporting the mechanism but they not as characterised as Kranz anatomy. Algal and cyanobacterial cells are yet more simplistic in structure, but the plasma membrane pumps and unique chloroplast structure are vital for the mechanism to exist.
C The internal concentration of CO
Each of the processes exists in a specific environment, C CAM plants and algal and cyanobacterial cells can exploit times when the environment is not as harsh by the turning on and off of the CO
