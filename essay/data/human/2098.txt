In 1986, Rumelhart and McClelland demonstrated that a computer could learn regular and irregular English past tenses, apparently extracting rules and regularities from the input to make predictions and guesses about unfamiliar verbs that appeared to mimic closely the way that children learn and produce English past tenses. It threw into question the very basis of the psycholinguistic orthodoxy that had prevailed for two decades: that language is derived from internally represented rules. Chomsky built his Universal Grammar theory as the Rumelhart and McClelland's model opened up the possibility that psychologists and linguists had grossly underestimated the mind's ability to learn grammaticality, and overestimated the complexity of the mechanism required to display apparently complex behaviour: input to an associationist system could be all that is required to explain language acquisition.
Since 1986, connectionist theories have been extended and refined to model a wide range of language phenomena, they have increasingly withstood criticism and found a place in or alongside other theories. In this assignment I will assess the contribution made by connectionism to our understanding of language acquisition, and I will consider how this new understanding could affect approaches to language teaching.
The principle behind the connectionist theories of psychology holds that the mind consists of units or nodes of information which exist in a network of multiple simultaneous interconnections. Input can activate a node or set of nodes which then trigger the activation of neighbouring associated nodes. The connections between the nodes can be stronger or weaker, the strength of connection being determined by the degree of stimulation of the connection. If asked to produce the past tense of Knowledge is seen as the sum of the various strengths of connections, and learning "consists of discovering the right connection strengths from the input" (R. Ellis 1994: 405). Importantly for language acquisition, and in contrast to behaviourist accounts, generalisations can be generated, so that previous learning can inform new experience, and thus rule-like behaviours emerge.
As explained above, connectionism represents a considerable departure from previously held theories of second language acquisition. How, then, can a teacher apply these principles to the classroom? I will focus on what I consider the three most important aspects of teaching that connectionism draws attention to.
Firstly, connectionism puts input This may come as no surprise to most teachers and students, but after behaviourism and the audiolingual method were sidelined, many cognitive theories of learning held frequency and practice as having only indirect influence upon the acquisition of language. In the case of strong Universal Grammar theory, for example, input only serves as a trigger to set the parameters of innate language knowledge. Connectionist learning, on the other hand, relies on large quantities of natural input combined with practice.
Secondly, the associative, rather than rule-governed, mechanisms of connectionism, evidenced in the corpus analysis of natural language, suggest a move away from a grammar-focussed syllabus towards a greater emphasis on
Thirdly, the view of connectionism that learning consists of adjusting the weights between nodes and, expressed in the Competition Model, meaning is understood and expressed through the interplay of competing cue weight, leads us to consider how the teacher can best facilitate
Connectionist theories offer some exciting fresh perspectives on the nature of human learning which clarify and strengthen some of the core aspects of second language teaching, notably with regard to input, practice and meaning. The prospect, however, of a comprehensive and durable theory of learning and classroom practice is still remote. In the meantime a pluralistic approach, informed by careful classroom research and moderated by a large dose of humility seems to me to offer the best chances of a successful learning outcome.
