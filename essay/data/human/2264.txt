The first stage involves creation of the geometry and meshing for the Static Mixer, which is carried out in The solid is created (see Fig 1.1) using drawing objects contained in the Tree View panel and the 2D geometry is then revolved to create the 3D solid. Material can also be added on different planes by creating new sketches on the appropriate plane axis.
Once the geometry is created, the mesh (Fig 1.2) can be set up in This is carried out by first defining 2D regions of the geometry which are later, using CFX-Pre, assigned boundary conditions. In this tutorial 3 regions were defined: The next stage involves setting up the mesh by defining the size for the elements of the mesh. This example used a (coarse) spacing of 0.3 for the mesh. Finally, the volume mesh is generated and saved for use in CFX-Pre.
The geometry can then be imported into Once the problem has been defined a definition file is written which is required for the CFD analysis in Solver calculates the solution by way of iteration where successive iterations will produce more accurate solutions, this is called convergence (Fig 1.3).
A results file is created once the solver has finished the analysis, which is then loaded into The flow pattern within the static mixer can be viewed by creating a point (which can be positioned anywhere within the mixer) for the origin of a streamline within the mixer. Different variables can be viewed such as pressure and temperature.
The following streamline flow pattern (Fig 1.4) is for temperature, where water enters the inlet pipe at a high temperature (red) and leaves at a colder temperature (blue):
A Slice Plane can is also created to view the flow pattern using different variables (temp. pressure etc.) at a cross section through the mixer, which is done by creating a new plane and defining its position using co-ordinates (Point and Normal method is used). The position of the plane can be re-adjusted using picking mode. Once parameters are defined the flow is made visible (Fig 1.6). Contours can also be viewed, which allow the user to more easily visualise points of equal values (or boundaries between different values/colours).
The plot can then be animated so that the flow sweeps the geometry of the mixer (inlet to outlet). This is done using animation editor, which allows the user to define number of frames (minimum of two required) including details such as plane starting position, temperature range and number of intermediate frames (where more frames increase duration of the animation clip). This file is then saved in MPEG format and is therefore viewable using Windows Media Player
This tutorial produces an injection mixer pipe. The main geometry is created using the A side pipe is created by adding a new plane based upon the The circle is extruded into the main pipe to produce the geometry in Fig 3.1.
The first stage in creating the mesh is to set up 2D regions. Regions set up for the pipe are The mesh spacing is then set using For the side pipe a finer mesh is desired since flow here is smaller than max. body spacing. To produce a finer mesh for the side pipe, a Finally, since velocity gradients near pipe wall can greatly vary, inflated layers are produced for this region.
The mesh is now imported into CFX-Pre. First, an expression for viscosity as a function of temperature is created which is used to modify properties of water. A list of expressions is made using Properties of water are then modified using these expressions and a domain is created defining the physics and fluid model to be used. Boundary conditions can then be created for The solver is then set for a maximum number of 50 iterations and initiated. Once solver is complete, CFX-Post is used to simulate flow. A streamline to examine velocity from main inlet is first created. It can be seen that flow tends to re-circulate near bottom of the vertical section of the main pipe (Fig 3.4). In order to investigate how well fluid from the side inlet mixes with fluid from main inlet, a streamline with constant colour is created. A modified duplicate of the streamline is also created for flow starting at the side inlet. The result is shown in Fig 3.5.
In this tutorial a geometry and mesh is created for a simulation of flow over a vehicle. The shape of the blunt body is drawn using features from the draw menu and the solid is generated by extrusion to a specific depth (Fig 5.1). A rectangular box is then created around the blunt body to form the region of flow. The blunt body must be frozen to avoid merging of the two solids and the blunt body can then be cut from the rectangle using Create > Body Operation (see Fig 5.2)
Once the geometry is created, the mesh can be created. The first step is to set up regions for defining boundaries later in CFX-Pre. Six regions are defined of which is a separate region for the blunt body to allow local visualisation and mesh control. Mesh spacing for the rectangular face is then defined in the normal way and a finer mesh is set up around the surfaces of the blunt body (as this is the region of interest) by inserting a Face Spacing for the 'Body', region as shown in Fig 5.3.
A thin layer of prismatic elements (5 layers) is then produced around the external surface of the body and ground using the However, it is found that the specified number of inflated layers is not produced (see Fig 5.5). This is because the gap between body and ground is only 2 elements thick and does not accommodate the number of required layers. This problem is overcome using the Once required settings are made the mesh can be generated.
The mesh is now imported into CFX-Pre and a turbulent/isothermal flow domain for the body is created. A The top and side surfaces use The solver is then set on At this stage the solving process can be divided between two processors to (parallel solver) to reduce the duration of the solving process.
CFD results calculated using half of geometry due to the symmetry. But for visualisation purposes full geometry can be used by creating an A vector plot also created to show velocity vectors behind the blunt body by creating a plane to locate region of interest (Fig 5.8). Finally, a surface plot of
This tutorial focuses on use of CFX-Mesh features in fixing poor CAD geometry's to produce good quality mesh. The geometry used contains many bad surfaces and short edges. These features give surface mesh with poor angles and short faces will cause regions with very fine mesh (Fig 14.1). Such inconsistencies are automatically detected under The initial step in improving the geometry is to create A means of ridding the geometry of short edges is the The effect of creating virtual edges is illustrated in the re-generated mesh (Fig 14.2). Another way to get rid of short edges is These adjustments result in a decrease in the number of errors detected and better quality mesh (Fig 14.3)
