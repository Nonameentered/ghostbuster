Elective Surgical Referral following outpatient visit to cardiology.

Came into hospital on the bus.
The patient was seen post operatively, but was able to give me a history of her condition before she had her operation and treatment.
The cause for the presenting complaint is already known as the patient is an elective admission and was seen post operatively.
The incompetent aortic valve allows regurgitation of blood from the aorta to the left ventricle during diastole. This produced the early diastolic murmur seen at the cardiology clinic.
The patient was experiencing shortness of breath, orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea due to oedema. Oedema arises because the incompetence of the aortic valve leads to an increased workload for the left ventricle. In response to this the cardiac cells hypertrophy and the hydrostatic pressure increases in the pulmonary circulation resulting in fluid accumulation in the lungs.
As the operation was successful and a soft prosthetic aortic valve fitted upon examination I would expect to find that the patients symptoms had been relieved. I would not expect to find an early diastolic murmur, visible carotid pulsations or a JVP. I would expect the apex beat of the heart to be slightly displaced due to its increased workload in the time leading up to Mrs
The examination supported the fact that the operation was a success. The patient's symptoms had been relieved and no early diastolic murmur could be heard. The apex beat was slightly displaced due to the increased demand on the left ventricle pre intervention. A significant decrease in Mrs

From this case I have seen for the first time, a heart valve lesion and also that major surgery can be performed successfully on an older patient, significantly improving the quality of their life.
