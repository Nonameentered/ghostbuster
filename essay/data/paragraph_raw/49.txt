Steven Katz claims in his essay on the historical perspective of the Holocaust that 'the intentional murder of European Jewry during World War II, is historically and phenomenologically unique' Annihilations have occurred in many countries throughout the century including Turkey, Rwanda, China, Bosnia and Cambodia, and whilst there are significant differences between each one- such as method of slaughter, death toll and time span of persecution- there are some factors common to them all. In fact, the Holocaust was not even the first great massacre of the twentieth century as the Armenian genocide occurred during the First World War, and Melson argues that it is 'a more accurate archetype than is the Holocaust for current mass murder in the postcolonial third world and in the contemporary post-communist world' However this does not exclude the Holocaust from sharing common characteristics with other massacres (as Katz disputes) for, on a fundamental level, patterns can be drawn between them. For instance they all arise from revolutionary or wartime climates, and also the motivation for their persecution was due to threat felt by the perpetrating parties. Therefore the Holocaust is not entirely unique, and neither are the other massacres of the twentieth century despite their geographical and statistical differences.
The most prominent common features between the massacres of the twentieth century and the Holocaust, however, concern the motives and reasons behind why each massacure occurred. Rozensaft argues that one of the main connections between the Holocaust and other annihilations is 'the underlying motive, the urgent drive that animate the perpetrators' In the case of the Holocaust, this 'drive' was anti-Semitic hatred, and Ann Frank noted the Germans were 'involved in a mysterious and cosmic battle against infiltration from the East and Washington's attempt to keep Europe Jewish' Similarly, the Ottoman Empire's objective was to increase mobility and to create a 'pan-Turkic nation' and therefore Turanian identity had to be forged, and this involved the annihilation of minority groups such as the Armenians- 'more than half of the two million Armenians living in the Empire had been killed by 1918' More recently, in Bosnia the Serbian government was trying to create their idea of 'greater Serbia', a strongly nationalistic state, and 'the policy of ethnic cleansing was designed to create areas populated by single ethnic groupings' Consequently, the Bosnian Muslims were stigmatised, and targeted for massacres. The Cambodian genocide would appear to share a very different motive to all the afore mentioned annihilations, for, as Cullen comments 'many histories of the Khmer Rouge regime simply forget the victims of genocide' Yet, in fact, the severity of the massacre was to ensure their communist state, and also encouraged by the previous attacks endured by Cambodia at the hands of Vietnam. Grease concludes that Pol Pot's murder spree 'was at least partly directed at Vietnam and China in an attempt to prove that Cambodians were pure enough to survive without foreign assistance or protection' Thus, on a fundamental level, it can be seen that motivation for massacure is common across the twentieth century, whether it be for territorial or ideological reasons, and this would appear to be the force that binds all annihilations of this period
The case of Cambodian genocide raises the example of massacre on a much broader, more national scale, and this form of massacre can be found elsewhere in the twentieth century- most notably in Nanking, China, during World War Two. As Callum Macdonald notes, in December 1937 'Japanese troops embarked on an orgy of murder, rape, arson and looting which lasted over six weeks' Similarly, in Cambodia whereas Pol Pot appeared to be attacking minorities, the massacre as a whole was a general ambush upon those that did not conform to the ideals of the communist party. This involved the slaughter of nearly 3000 Buddhists, 215,000 Chinese, 12000 Thai, and 'the Vietnamese community...was entirely eradicated' The Muslim Chams were also targeted for, like the cases of Armenia and the Holocaust, 'their distinct religion, language and culture, large villages and autonomous networks threatened the atomized, closely supervised society that the Pol Pot leadership planned' However this threat extended to all the aforementioned groups within Cambodia and became more of a national assault like the Japanese rape of Nanking. The only significant point that establishes Nanking as different in motive, though, is that it was an inter-national hostility that led to massacre (like in Bosnia). In Cambodia, Armenia and the Holocaust, massacre was derived from the respective government initiatives to impress their regime and ideals upon their country.
In every case, prior to the slaughter, some form of unrest had occurred, and this is a common factor between both the Armenian and Holocaust genocides. The former was a result of the 'control and regulations on social, economic and religious activity, that had been imposed on the Armenian minority of Turkey' Similarly, the start of the Holocaust was caused by Germany's 'declaration of a new order' in 1933, and the aggression against Jews and other minorities, which created the totalitarian Nazi regime. The Bosnians also suffered an unstable transition with the fall of the Yugoslavian state in 1992, a process Prober says 'created dangerous competition between the new nation-states over natural resources, cultural identity, and most importantly, land' The Pol Pot era of 1975-79 in Cambodia can also be attributed to instability after civil war as the nation fought to rebuild itself and thus the 'genocide was a response of the communist party to reassert control over the re-emerging Cambodian nation' In all these instances, the instability before the onset of slaughter proves a link between the different annihilations, and the fact that movements of revolution allowed the perpetrating regimes to implement their rule through persecution.
The involvement of warfare does not just make possible annihiliations by providing the ideal climate for the birth of new regimes-as discussed in the paragraph above- but also by making it possible for genocide to be perpetrated on such a large scale as the perpetrator countries were able to utilise the plight of war to their advantage, and exercised their power against any governmentally identified threat. In both the Holocaust and Cambodian genocide the threat of war was used to raise the intensity of the regimes' power, as 'until 1941 the massive destruction... [of European Jewry] was carried out...while the Nazi policy of war was still directed mainly against Poland and other Eastern European countries, and not against Germany's enemies in the West' Similarly, in Cambodia, the target of the Pol Pot regime was never a foreign power, but rather its own population. War gave them the opportunity to exercise their power, and it also allowed other countries to turn a blind eye to the problem in the hope of appeasing an opposing power. This raises the example of the United Nations response to the Bosnian genocide. Many researchers argue that the UN was particularly slow in their response, and this could be partly attributed to the war between Serbia and Croatia. Germany and France also were unwilling to intervene, 'fearing the interruption of Yugoslavian trade' with Germany also 'alarmed by the possibility that military intervention would have on the elections looming in Germany at the time' The United Nations involvement in the Bosnian massacre, and the hesitance of other countries to become involved is a further similarities between all of the massacres of the twentieth century.
Apart from the conditions surrounding massacre there are further commonalities between all of these countries. During the Holocaust, the Jews were dehumanized to make it easier to commit murder, 'including so-called "racial science", the use of "minimization rhetoric", propaganda against the Jews and the use of special militarized police units to systematically execute them' The same can be said of the Armenians, for between 1915-18 hundreds of thousands died due to 'the dictates of government policy, and the victims were to be denied, in large measure, their essential humanity' In Cambodia, it is estimated that up to 900,000 people died through the Pol Pot regime, however as with the Armenians and Jews of the Holocaust, these deaths were only possible through relegation of basic human rights: 'millions of Cambodians were forced to abandon their homes, and to submit to a brutal regime of labor, starvation and execution' In Bosnia, it was not detachment from humanity that enabled massacre, but rather dehumanization of victims as a means of psychological defense from the hatred expressed by the Serbs and Croats. Its Serbian militia were 'literally referred to as "wolves" who had been released to slaughter 'wild animals'' and in this way massacre in Bosnia was possible due to 'psychological fiction in which Bosnians became a kind of abstract evil overcome by a heroic militia action'
Therefore, overall, whereas each twentieth century massacre occurred in very different manifestations, at different times, and for varying periods of time with differing scales of death, they do share some fundamental characteristics. In the cases of the Armenians, the Holocaust, Bosnia and Cambodia, all massacres involve the persecution of minority groups threatening the government, and the annihilations themselves were carried out in an unstable post-revolutionary climate. In all five examples warfare made massacre possible, and this is a crucial common factor between the countries as the ability to perpetrate such large-scale murders was only possible under the veil of warfare. Also, many countries felt the need to dehumanize victims in order to commit massacres and therefore not only were there similarities in the characteristics of their causation, but their methods of coping with atrocity.
