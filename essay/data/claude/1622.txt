The auction system described in the essay relies on a network of servers to facilitate the bidding process and ensure a fair auction. However, there are several potential issues with this system, particularly regarding the reliability of the servers. If any of the servers were to malfunction or go offline during an auction, it could disrupt the bidding process and call the fairness and integrity of the auction into question.  

To start, if the primary server that is handling bids and updating the auction status were to go down during an active auction, no new bids could be processed and bidders would be left in the dark about the current highest bid. This could frustrate bidders and potentially result in lost bids if the server issues were not resolved before the auction closes. Similarly, if any of the backup servers were offline that contain a copy of the bidding data and auction status, the system would lose its redundancy and be vulnerable to data loss if any other servers were to fail.  

Another issue is if the network connection between the client application used to view and bid on auctions and the servers was disrupted. Even if the servers themselves stayed online, bidders would be unable to view, place, or update bids which would prevent them from participating fully in the auction. Poor network connectivity could also lead to delays that result in "sniping" or last second bids that other bidders do not have a fair chance to counterbid against before the auction closes.

Finally, if the payment processing server was to become unavailable at the end of an auction, the winning bidder would be unable to immediately pay for and claim their item. This could delay the entire post-auction process and potentially cause issues for the seller waiting for payment.  

In conclusion, while a distributed network of servers provides redundancy and helps ensure an active online auction system stays up and running, there are still several possible points of failure that could temporarily disrupt an auction or cause issues. For a large-scale system like eBay, robust disaster recovery and business continuity plans are essential for maintaining uptime even if one or more servers go down. Load balancing, redundancy, and the ability to seamlessly shift resources as needed help ensure maximum reliability and a good experience for both buyers and sellers. Overall, a well-designed auction system should have failsafes and a strategy in place to stay operational even if some components become nonfunctional.
