Here is a draft 1500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Global warming is leading to rising temperatures around the world, as well as changes in weather patterns and precipitation levels. These climatic changes are expected to have significant impacts on water availability and water-related diseases in semi-arid areas, such as the grasslands of Africa, North East China, the Mediterranean, and parts of Australia. 

In semi-arid areas like these, water is already scarce and populations are highly dependent on consistent precipitation and access to water sources like rivers, lakes, and groundwater aquifers. Higher temperatures caused by global warming will lead to increased evaporation of surface water and drying of soils, exacerbating water stress in these regions. Changes in weather patterns may also reduce precipitation levels, further limiting water availability. Droughts are likely to become more frequent and intense, straining water resources during those periods.

Limited and unpredictable water supplies will make it more difficult for communities in these areas to sustain agriculture, further threatening food security. Lack of access to clean water and scarcity of water for hygiene and sanitation will also increase the spread of diseases. Stagnant pools, inadequate waste disposal, and lack of water to wash hands all provide breeding grounds for diseases like malaria, dysentery, and cholera. Limited water may also force people to drink from contaminated sources, spreading water-borne diseases. 

Populations in semi-arid lands often lack infrastructure for water storage, distribution, and treatment. As water stress intensifies with climate change, there will be an even greater need for adaptation through improvements in water management, access to drought-resistant crop varieties, irrigation systems, and water conservation techniques. Better monitoring and prediction of droughts can help communities prepare, and policies around equitable water distribution will be critical. 

In many of these regions, poverty levels are high and public health systems are already struggling. The impacts of water scarcity and climate change could overwhelm vulnerable populations. International support and cooperation will be needed to help semi-arid areas adapt to worsening water stress and health issues caused or exacerbated by global warming. 

Global warming poses serious threats to water security and health in semi-arid lands through higher temperatures, changes in weather patterns, more frequent droughts, and strained infrastructure. Urgent action is needed to help communities in these water-stressed areas strengthen their resilience in the face of worsening water scarcity and climate change impacts. With proactive policies, investments, and adaptation measures, especially for the most vulnerable populations, some of the worst effects may be mitigated. But if little is done, lack of access to clean water could become a crisis of catastrophic proportions in many of these semi-arid regions.
