Thunderclouds contain processes that lead to the dramatic natural phenomenon of lightning. Within thick cumulonimbus clouds, updrafts carry water droplets and ice crystals high up into the atmosphere where temperatures are well below freezing. As the water droplets and ice crystals collide, rub, and bump into each other, they become positively and negatively charged through a mechanism known as charge separation. The lighter, positively charged particles rise to the top of the cloud, while the heavier, negatively charged particles sink to the bottom of the cloud. 

This charge separation results in enormous potential differences between the top and bottom of the cloud, sometimes over 100 million volts. When the potential difference becomes too great, a massive electrical discharge occursâ€”we see this as a bolt of lightning. The intensity and frequency of lightning in a storm depends on how efficiently the updrafts can carry water droplets and ice crystals high up in the cloud, and how strongly charge separation can occur. More collisions and interactions between the water droplets and ice crystals mean greater charge separation and a higher chance of lightning strikes.

The discharge of lightning equalizes the charge within the thundercloud and releases enormous amounts of energy in the form of heat, light, and sound. However, not all lightning forms entirely within clouds. Some lightning discharges, known as cloud-to-atmosphere lightning, travel from the cloud towards the earth or higher up into the atmosphere. These types of lightning may lead to new understandings in physics, such as how charge can build up and discharge at different altitudes in the atmosphere. Studies show that blue jets, gigantic jets, and sprites are forms of cloud-to-atmosphere lightning that often initiate at the top of thunderclouds before discharging upwards at speeds of 100,000 mph. Understanding these upper atmospheric electrical phenomena can provide insight into how and why charge separation occurs in thunderclouds and the conditions that are necessary to drive these immense electrical discharges.

In summary, the natural phenomenon of lightning in thunderclouds depends on the mechanisms of water droplet and ice crystal interactions to separate charge and create enormous potential differences. The intensity of a lightning storm relates to how efficiently these charge separation processes can operate. Exploring types of cloud-to-atmosphere lightning can lead to new discoveries in the physics of charge buildup and release at different altitudes in the atmosphere. With more observations and modeling, we can better understand the specific conditions within thunderclouds that drive all forms of lightning discharge.
