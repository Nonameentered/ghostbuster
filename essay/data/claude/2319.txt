Stokes Drift and Numerical Modeling

Stokes Drift refers to the slow steady horizontal drift of fluid parcels when surface gravity waves propagate through them. It arises due to the orbital motion of fluid parcels beneath the wave crests and troughs. Although the net transport of water over a wave cycle is zero, the nonlinearity of the equations of motion leads to a small net drift in the direction of wave propagation. 

Stokes Drift can be numerically modeled using an explicit finite difference method by solving the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations with free surface gravity waves. A two-dimensional numerical wave tank can be set up with waves propagating in one direction. Within the tank, a large number of passive particles are seeded to represent fluid parcels. Over the simulation, the position of each particle is updated based on the fluid velocity and acceleration at its location. The average drift of the particles is calculated to determine the Stokes Drift velocity.

As more waves are added to the numerical model, the Stokes Drift velocity generally increases due to greater orbital motions of the fluid parcels. However, the relationship is nonlinear. Doubling the wave amplitude does not necessarily double the Stokes Drift. At small wave amplitudes, the Stokes Drift velocity is proportional to the square of the wave amplitude, as predicted by the asymptotic theory of Stokes. The numerical model confirms this quadratic relationship at small wave amplitudes.

In the numerical model, the waves generate orbital movements of the fluid parcels, causing them to circle beneath the wave crests and troughs. Although the net displacement over one wave cycle is nearly zero, the slightly uneven forces on either side of the wave crest leads to a small net drift in the direction of wave propagation. This demonstrates how waves can facilitate transport even when the net transport of water is zero. The primary effect of waves in generating Stokes Drift is through these nonlinear orbital motions and unsteady forces in the fluid.  

In summary, Stokes Drift refers to the steady drift of fluid parcels when surface waves pass through them. It arises from the orbital movements of parcels under waves and the slight imbalance of forces over the wave cycle. A numerical model solving the Navier-Stokes equations with surface waves can calculate the Stokes Drift by tracking passive particles in a wave tank. The model confirms that at small wave amplitudes, the Stokes Drift velocity is proportional to the square of wave amplitude, agreeing with Stokesâ€™ asymptotic theory. The primary mechanism for particle displacement is the orbital motion of parcels beneath the waves. By modeling Stokes Drift, we can better understand how surface waves assist in transporting fluids.
