Here is a draft 500-word essay response to the prompt:

There are several web-based resources that track developing countries' progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Two of the leading resources are the World Bank publication The Millennium Development Goals Report and the MDG Monitor from the Center for Global Development (CGD). 

The MDG Report provides an official assessment of the progress for all MDGs in every country based on a comprehensive set of development indicators. It is published annually by the World Bank, in collaboration with the IMF, OECD, and the UN. The strengths of the MDG Report are that it provides a consistent and authoritative tracking of progress over time and across countries. However, a key weakness is that as an official UN publication, it may be subject to political pressures to overly inflate progress on certain MDGs. It also provides limited context on the nuances or challenges within each country.

The CGD's MDG Monitor provides an independent assessment of MDG progress using a scoring system from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest. It incorporates additional indicators and information beyond the official UN metrics. The strengths of the MDG Monitor are its independence, nuanced scoring system, and inclusion of supplemental indicators to provide better context. However, its assessments can be subjective, and the scoring methodology is not always transparent or consistent across years. The information is also provided at a higher level, so lacks details on progress within countries.

Both the MDG Report and the MDG Monitor are helpful resources to gain an overview of developing countries' progress toward meeting the MDGs. The MDG Report provides the most authoritative and consistent tracking based on official data and metrics. The MDG Monitor provides an independent assessment with a more nuanced scoring approach, but its subjectivity and lack of transparency are weaknesses. For a comprehensive perspective, analyzing them together would provide the benefits of multiple data sources and methodologies. But ultimately, additional research into country-specific reports and statistics may be needed to develop a complete understanding of the complex realities within each developing nation.
