Scientific investigation of Egyptian mummies has revealed a wealth of information about ancient Egyptian lifestyle, beliefs, diet, health, and embalming practices. Mummies provide a physical record of life in ancient Egypt, and modern scientific techniques have allowed researchers to analyze mummies in new ways to gain insights into how the ancient Egyptians lived and died.

Ancient Egyptians had a diet based around bread, beer, and grains like emmer wheat and barley. Isotope analysis of mummies shows that most Egyptians ate a C3 plant-based diet, with some animal protein from sources like goat and fish. The diet of the wealthy included more meat and dairy, while the poor subsisted mostly on grains and vegetables. Overall, the Egyptian diet was very carbohydrate- and calorie-dense to support the laborious agricultural lifestyle. 

Analyses of mummies have also revealed much about health and disease in ancient Egypt. Skeletal analysis shows evidence of malnutrition, anemia, and infectious diseases like malaria and tuberculosis. Parasitic worms and dental abscesses were also common. The average life expectancy was around 30-40 years. However, the wealthy and the royal family had better nutrition and health care, and some pharaohs lived into their 60s. Embalming was important to ancient Egyptians to preserve the body for the afterlife. 

The mummification process involved removing internal organs and desiccating the body using natron salt. Analysis of mummies shows the embalmers were very skilled - they removed the organs through a small incision and tucked them into canopic jars. The brain was generally left in place or removed in pieces. The body was packed in natron for 40-70 days, then wrapped in linen and placed in a sarcophagus. Mummification was an expensive process, so only wealthy Egyptians could afford the highest quality.

Finally, trade and natural resources are linked to mummification. Natron, a mineral composed primarily of sodium carbonate, was gathered from dry lake beds in Wadi Natrun. Linen used for embalming and wrapping was made from flax grown along the Nile. Resins, oils and embalming materials were imported from the Mediterranean and Red Sea. Myrrh, frankincense, pistachio resin and cedar oil had to be imported from Arabia and the horn of Africa. The wide trade networks enabled the materials and resources required for mummification to be accessed in ancient Egypt.

In summary, scientific study of mummies has revealed a plethora of information about how ancient Egyptians lived, died, ate, and practiced medicine and religion. Mummies provide unparalleled insights into life in an ancient civilization. Along with evidence of trade, diet, disease, and mummification practices, Egyptologists have gained glimpses into the very humanity of a culture that lived over 3,000 years ago.
