Here is a draft 2000 word essay in response to the prompt: 

Efficiency wage theories provide an explanation for why employers may pay wages above the market-clearing level. These theories argue that higher wages can motivate employees and encourage higher productivity, thus offsetting the higher wage costs. There are several variants of efficiency wage theories, including shirking models where higher wages reduce the incentive for workers to shirk, fair wage models where higher wages boost morale, and adverse selection models where higher wages attract higher-quality job applicants.

The Shapiro-Stiglitz model is one of the most well-known efficiency wage theories. It focuses on the effect of wages on shirking behavior. The model assumes that employees can choose their effort level, that higher effort is more costly for workers, that employers cannot perfectly monitor employee effort, and that the odds of getting caught shirking depend on the level of monitoring by the firm. Given these assumptions, if the wage is low, the cost of getting caught shirking is low so employees will rationally choose to shirk more. However, at a higher "efficiency" wage, the cost of job loss is higher so employees will shirk less. Even though the higher wage costs more, the gains from reduced shirking and increased productivity offset the costs. 

The efficiency wage has two primary effects in the Shapiro-Stiglitz model. First, it motivates employees to exert more effort and work harder, reducing shirking. This boosts productivity and profits for the firm. Second, it leads to "involuntary unemployment" as the higher wages price some workers out of the job market. Firms have no incentive to cut wages to reduce unemployment, because lower wages would increase shirking and reduce productivity. The efficiency wage balances these two effects at the point that maximizes the firm's profits.

The Shapiro-Stiglitz model provides intuition as to why real wages might be above the market-clearing level and why unemployment persists in equilibrium. The efficiency wage gives workers a greater incentive for effort and also a greater cost of job loss, both of which discourage shirking. The model illustrates how wages, productivity, unemployment, and business profits can all be interlinked, with higher wages leading to greater productivity and also potentially higher unemployment. Overall, the efficiency wage theory provides key insights into how real-world labor markets may function.
