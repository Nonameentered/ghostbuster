The rise of consumerism in the Victorian era represented a fundamental shift in the culture of the modern world. Several factors contributed to the growth of mass consumerism during this period, including the emergence of large department stores, the rise of mass advertising, and the gendering of shopping as a leisure activity primarily for women. These factors combined to create a new middle class culture oriented around consumption and display of material goods.

The department store was a pivotal development that enabled a new mass consumer culture. Stores like Whiteley's in London or Macy's in New York provided a wide array of goods under one roof, making a large volume and variety of products available to customers. They also promoted a culture where shopping became an end in itself, rather than simply a means to acquire necessities. The lavish displays and in-store events transformed shopping into a form of entertainment and spectacle.

Mass advertising was another critical factor in the rise of consumer culture. New advertising techniques were pioneered during this era, including catchy jingles, celebrity endorsements, and psychological methods to associate products with desirable traits. Mass advertising stoked demand for products and created new needs and desires in the public. It also reinforced the notion that consumption and acquisition of goods were measures of self-worth and identity.

A particularly significant aspect of the new consumer culture was the gendering of shopping as an activity primarily for women. Shopping had traditionally been a male sphere, but department stores specifically targeted women by providing amenities like restaurants, daycares, and lounges. They promoted the idea that shopping was a leisure pastime suitable for ladies of status. This gendered approach was pivotal in driving the mass consumption of the era.

There were certainly critics of the mass consumerism. Some saw it as a threat to traditional values of thrift, hard work, and modesty. Others argued it exploited vulnerable consumers and encouraged superficial materialism over more noble pursuits. Yet in the end, the forces driving consumer culture could not be overcome. The wants and pleasures it satisfied, along with the economic growth it fueled, made it an unstoppable juggernaut that defined the Victorian era.    

The rise of the modern consumer society in England during the 19th century marked a sea change in culture with effects that persist to today. The Victorian era's focus on mass consumption, display, and spectacle introduced patterns of behavior that remain in the fabric of contemporary consumer culture. Overall, the emergence of the department store, the rise of mass advertising, and the associating of consumption with femininity were the principal drivers of this cultural shift that shaped the modern world.
