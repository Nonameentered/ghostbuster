Tinea capitis refers to dermatophyte infection of the scalp resulting in hair loss and scale. It most commonly affects pre-pubertal children, especially those of African descent. There are several differential diagnoses for diffuse scalp scale and alopecia including seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, trichotillomania, and alopecia areata. 

Seborrheic dermatitis presents with yellowish, greasy scale and inflammation affecting the scalp, face, and upper trunk. It is not usually associated with hair loss and the scale is not usually adherent to the scalp. Atopic dermatitis may have areas of scale but is usually intensely pruritic and presents with erythema and lichenification. Psoriasis also produces scale but is typically silvery, pityriasis steatoides, and may have joint involvement. Trichotillomania refers to self-induced hair loss, usually with broken hairs of uneven lengths remaining. Alopecia areata presents with smooth, rounded patches of complete hair loss and no scale.

Tinea capitis has several clinical patterns. Black dot ringworm refers to spores within hair shafts that appear as black dots. Kerion refers to a boggy, inflammatory mass with overlying scale and hair loss. Favus is a severe, chronic infection with dense, adherent yellow scale and scarring alopecia. Diffuse scale and patchy hair loss is also common, referred to as seborrheic or squamous tinea capitis. Rarely, tinea capitis may resemble seborrheic dermatitis or mimic alopecia areata. A KOH preparation showing hyphae combined with dermoscopic visualization of hair shaft infection confirms the diagnosis. 

Treatment of tinea capitis aims to clear the infection, reduce transmission, and encourage hair regrowth. Oral antifungal agents are required, usually griseofulvin, terbinafine, or itraconazole. Griseofulvin is well-studied in children but requires a prolonged course of 6-12 weeks. Terbinafine and itraconazole have the advantage of shorter treatment durations (2-4 weeks) but less data on use in children. All close contacts should be screened for asymptomatic infection and treated if positive. Antifungal shampoos may provide additional benefit. Severe or refractory cases may require combination oral antifungal therapy. Hair loss may continue for weeks after treatment, but full recovery typically occurs within 3-6 months.

In summary, tinea capitis is a common infection of the scalp that requires oral antifungal therapy and close contact screening/treatment. The clinical diagnosis is suggested by the pattern of hair loss and scale, but KOH preparation and/or dermoscopy provide definitive diagnosis. Griseofulvin remains a first-line treatment, especially in children, but shorter courses of terbinafine or itraconazole are also options. With treatment, most patients with tinea capitis will experience full resolution over 3-6 months.
