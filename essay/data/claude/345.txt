Export-led growth has been a key driver of economic development for many low to middle income countries. A focus on manufacturing exports in particular has allowed developing countries to grow their economies, increase GDP, and raise standards of living. Between 1985 and 2000, many developing countries experienced strong growth in manufactured exports, which contributed to an overall increase in economic growth and GDP. 

Manufacturing exports are determined by several factors. The first is the availability of low-cost labor and resources that can support the manufacturing industry. Many developing countries have a competitive advantage in labor-intensive manufacturing due to low wages, especially compared to developed countries. The second factor is foreign direct investment (FDI) from multinational corporations looking to tap into low-cost labor and resources. FDI brings capital, technology transfer, and access to global supply chains that boost manufacturing exports. The third factor is the availability of productive infrastructure like roads, ports, and electricity that allow manufacturers to operate and export goods.

Government policy also influences manufacturing exports. Policies that promote free trade and openness to FDI and global trade increase exports. Tax incentives for manufacturers and exporters also support export growth. Investments in infrastructure, education, and workforce training help develop the means of production to enable manufacturing and exporting. Stable governance and policy environments give companies more confidence to invest in manufacturing for export.

Cross-sectional data from 40 developing countries between 1985 to 2000 shows a strong positive relationship between manufacturing exports and GDP growth. Countries with higher manufacturing exports as a percentage of total exports experienced higher average annual GDP growth. For example, China, Thailand, and Vietnam all had high shares of manufacturing exports and GDP growth over 7% per year. Countries with higher FDI inflows and electricity consumption also tended to have higher manufacturing export shares and faster GDP growth.

Manufacturing exports contribute to economic growth in several ways. They bring in revenue from global markets that funds investment in the domestic economy. They create jobs in manufacturing sectors with spillover employment effects in related industries. They expose domestic firms to global technologies and best practices, fostering innovation and productivity gains. And they diversify risk by decreasing dependence on domestic markets alone.

The composition of exports also matters for how much they drive growth. Manufacturing exports have stronger spillovers than primary goods or resource exports. Manufactured exports also tend to be more technologically advanced, capital-intensive, and skill-intensive, so they promote upgrading within the economy. And diversity in manufactured exports provides more stable growth since the economy is not dependent on a single product.

In summary, manufacturing exports have been a key driver of GDP growth for developing countries. They are determined by competitive factors of production, FDI, infrastructure, and policy environments. Manufacturing exports contribute to growth through various mechanisms, and more diverse and technologically advanced manufacturing exports have the strongest impacts on long-term economic development. For policymakers, supporting the development of manufacturing export capacity can be an effective growth strategy.
