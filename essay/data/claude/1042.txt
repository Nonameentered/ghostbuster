John Locke proposes that personal identity consists in consciousness, specifically "the consciousness of my past actions" and "the concern for my future ones" (Locke, 1690). For Locke, a person's identity is grounded in their mental experiences and memories, not their physical body. Based on this view, it would seem possible for a person to swap bodies with another, as long as their consciousness and continuity of memories are transferred along with it. 

However, Locke's definition of personal identity based solely in consciousness and memory is problematic. One major criticism is that memory is unreliable and imperfect. Our memories can fail us at times, we forget many details of our lives, and we can even form false or manipulated memories. If identity depends entirely on memory, what happens when we can no longer remember key aspects of our lives or past experiences that shaped who we are? Do we lose our identity or become a new person in those instances? This criticism exposes a key weakness in Locke's theory.

Another issue with Locke's view is that it implies a kind of mind-body dualism. Memories and consciousness seem to rely on physical neurological mechanisms in the brain. But according to Locke's theory, my identity could remain intact even if my physical brain was destroyed and my mind was somehow transplanted into a new body. This seems implausible given what we know about the connection between the mind and the physical body. Both memory and consciousness emerge from biological processes, so they cannot be separated from the physical body in the way Locke's theory proposes.

To address these issues, Bernard Williams provides an alternative view that incorporates both physical and psychological elements. He argues that for any person at a given time, there are certain physical or bodily characteristics as well as character traits, memories, beliefs and values that make up who they are. If too many of these features were lost or irreversibly changed, we could no longer call that being "the same person". For Williams, identity relies on continuity of both the physical body and consciousness/memory.  

Under Williams' view, mind swapping or body transfer would threaten one's personal identity because it severs the link between mind and body on which identity depends. Even if memories and beliefs were transplanted to a new body, the biological mechanisms that gave rise to them in the first place would be lost. The new body would have a different set of biological characteristics, abilities, and behaviors that make us who we are. Therefore, Williams' theory avoids the issues of mind-body dualism and overreliance on memory that plague Locke's view. Overall, Williams provides a more plausible account of identity that considers both physical and psychological factors, rather than reducing identity to consciousness alone.

In conclusion, while Locke's definition of personal identity provides an interesting starting point, his sole focus on consciousness and memory is problematic and implausible. Criticisms around issues of mind-body dualism, biological continuity and the imperfect nature of memory suggest that identity cannot depend entirely on consciousness. Williams' view incorporates both psychological and physical elements, linking identity to continuity of mind and body, thus providing a more comprehensive and compelling theory of personal identity.
