Several core ideas from Karl Marx's theories of historical materialism and critique of capitalism remain relevant in modern politics and economics. His insights inform how we understand societal development and the tensions involved in social progress. 

Marx believed that economic and technological forces shape historical change, an idea known as historical materialism. He saw economies transition through different modes of production—feudalism to capitalism, for instance—as technologies and social relationships evolved. This materialist view of history still provides a useful lens for understanding broad patterns of social change today. New technologies like artificial intelligence and renewable energy are restructuring our economy and society. Economic globalization has transformed relationships between nations and people worldwide. Looking at such massive shifts through a materialist, technologically-centered framework as Marx proposed helps make sense of an era of great change.

Marx's critique of capitalism also remains relevant today. He argued that capitalism inevitably leads to the concentration of wealth and power in fewer hands. We see this borne out in modern data on rising inequality and the accrual of vast fortunes. Marx believed there were internal contradictions in capitalism that would ultimately lead to its demise. Points of tension like the drive for endless profits vs. environmental sustainability or the social instability caused by inequality are seen by some today as existential threats to our system. Understanding the structural instabilities Marx pointed to provides insight into risks and challenges capitalism still faces. 

However, Marx did not foresee government interventions that would stabilize capitalism and address some of its excesses. Social welfare programs, progressive taxation, and market regulations have softened capitalism's sharpest edges. State policy has mitigated crises of overproduction and unemployment that Marx anticipated would intensify capitalism's contradictions. So while Marx's critique highlights real issues, the reality is more complex than the inevitable revolution he envisioned. 

Finally, Marx's vision of a socialist utopia where social classes are abolished and people live in cooperation still inspires visions of a just society, even as historical communist regimes have been discredited. The desire for an economic system focused on meeting human needs instead of maximizing profits lives on. But there is no consensus on how to achieve a socialist system that protects political and economic freedoms—a challenge Marx did not grapple with in depth.

In conclusion, Marx's historical materialism and critique of capitalism remain highly relevant today. They provide a theoretical framework for understanding social change and instability in the current era. However, the complexity of modern society and politics means that the realities we grapple with differ in key ways from Marx's predictions. While Marx's ideas still inform progressive thought, the world has moved on from his revolutionary vision of society's inevitable future. Overall, a nuanced understanding of Marx's theories still enhances our ability to think critically about social progress in the 21st century.
