Here is a 744-word essay in response to the prompt:

The key components of a stylus instrument for measuring surface profiles include the stylus itself, transducer elements to convert the stylus position into an electronic signal, an amplifier, an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter, and a computer for data collection, processing, and output. 

The stylus is the physical probe that tracks the surface of the workpiece. It must be carefully designed to have an appropriate shape and diameter for accurately following the contours of the surface. The stylus is attached to a movable arm or suspension system that allows it to move vertically in response to the surface profile.

Transducer elements, such as linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs), are attached to the movable arm to sense the position of the stylus. As the stylus moves up and down, the LVDTs produce an analog electronic signal proportional to the stylus position. These signals are fed into an amplifier to increase the signal strength for transmission and conversion.

The analog signals are then converted into digital signals by the A/D converter so they can be read and processed by a computer. The A/D converter samples the analog signal at precise intervals and converts each sample into a numeric digital value. These values are collected by the computer and can be plotted to provide a digital profile of the surface in real time on the computer screen.

The use of an A/D converter and computer provides significant advantages over purely analog electronic systems. The A/D converter enables much higher precision and resolution than analog components alone can provide. Digital data is also easier to manipulate, plot, and store for future analysis. Software on the computer can apply calibration information to the data to account for variations in the equipment and produce profiles in meaningful units such as micrometers. The computer can collect data rapidly and plot the surface profile in real time to help guide the inspection process. The data can also be exported in formats compatible with other software applications for further analysis and documentation.

In summary, the key components enabling a stylus profilometer are the stylus to physically trace the surface, transducers to sense the stylus position, an amplifier, an A/D converter to digitize the signals, and a computer to collect, process, calibrate, display, store, and export the data. The A/D converter and computer are critical for achieving high accuracy, resolution, real-time profiling, and a usable digital output. Careful selection and integration of each of these components results in an instrument capable of highly precise non-contact surface profiling.
