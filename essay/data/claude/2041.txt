Here is a draft essay in response to the prompt in approximately 2000 words:

The theme of justice and its consequences is central to much of Greek tragedy. In many plays, the pursuit of justice or vengeance by the main characters goes too far, ultimately leading to their downfall. This theme is evident in Sophocles’ Antigone and Oedipus Rex as well as Euripides’ Hecabe. 

In Antigone, the title character pursues what she believes is just by burying her brother Polyneices against the orders of King Creon. Antigone believes she has a moral duty to bury her brother, as proper burial rites are extremely important in Greek culture. However, King Creon has forbidden the burial of Polyneices because he was a traitor. Antigone knowingly defies Creon’s orders in the name of justice and family duty. While Antigone’s actions seem noble, her uncompromising pursuit of justice leads to her doom. When Creon discovers that Antigone has buried her brother, he sentences her to death. Although Creon eventually realizes his mistake and tries to free Antigone, he is too late. She commits suicide, enabling her pursuit of justice to end in tragedy.

In Oedipus Rex, the title character pursues the truth about the murder of the previous king of Thebes, Laius, but his quest for justice leads to his tragic downfall. When the play begins, Thebes is suffering from a plague, and Oedipus vows to find the killer of Laius to end it. However, as Oedipus gets closer and closer to the truth, he discovers that he himself is guilty of patricide and incest—he unknowingly killed his father Laius and married his mother Jocasta. Although Oedipus believes he is pursuing justice, his quest for the truth destroys him and his family. Upon discovering the truth, Jocasta commits suicide and Oedipus gouges out his own eyes and goes into exile. Oedipus’s tragic downfall is thus a result of his relentless search for justice and truth.

In Hecabe, the title character, the widow of the slain Trojan king Priam, pursues vengeance against Polymestor, the Thracian king who murdered her youngest son Polydorus. Hecabe tricks Polymestor and has his sons murdered as revenge. At first, Hecabe’s vengeance seems justified, as Polymestor betrayed the laws of hospitality by killing Polydorus. However, Hecabe's actions are cruel and excessive. By murdering innocent people for the crime of one man, Hecabe stoops to Polymestor's level. Her vengeance destroys multiple lives and brings her no peace. Though Hecabe seeks justice for her son's murder, her pursuit of vengeance leads only to more tragedy.

In conclusion, the plays Antigone, Oedipus Rex, and Hecabe all demonstrate how the pursuit of justice and vengeance, when taken to an extreme, leads to tragic consequences for the characters involved and those around them. Though the protagonists in these dramas have good intentions, their uncompromising stances and cruel actions destroy many lives, showing that justice must be tempered by mercy. The tragedies serve as a warning that excess, even in the name of justice, often breeds more injustice.
