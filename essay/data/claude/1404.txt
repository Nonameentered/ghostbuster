Does the draft Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities adequately address the unique needs of women with disabilities? 

The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is a landmark human rights document adopted by the United Nations in 2006 aimed at protecting the rights of people with disabilities worldwide. While the CRPD makes significant strides in articulating the rights of all persons with disabilities and setting standards to promote, protect and ensure those rights, it does have some gaps in addressing the unique needs and challenges faced by women with disabilities.  

Women with disabilities face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination and disadvantage due to both their gender and their disability status. They experience higher rates of poverty, lower educational outcomes, higher unemployment, and less political participation and representation than both men with disabilities and non-disabled women. They also face higher risks of violence, abuse and exploitation. The CRPD does recognize women with disabilities as a vulnerable group in need of special attention and it mainstream a gender perspective in some of its provisions. However, more could still be done to strengthen specific protections of the rights of women with disabilities.

In terms of general principles, the CRPD promotes "respect for difference and acceptance of persons with disabilities as part of human diversity and humanity” (Article 3) and “respect for inherent dignity, individual autonomy including the freedom to make one’s own choices, and independence of persons” (Article 3). This supports recognizing and respecting the rights of all persons with disabilities, regardless of gender, to make life choices and participate fully in society. The CRPD also calls for “taking into account the protection and promotion of the human rights of persons with disabilities in all policies and programs” (Article 4). This requires disability-inclusive and gender-sensitive policymaking that considers the rights and needs of women with disabilities. 

With regard to equality and non-discrimination, the CRPD specifies that “women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple discrimination” (Article 6). It obliges States Parties to “take all appropriate measures to ensure the full development, advancement and empowerment of women, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms” (Article 6). However, the provisions could strengthen specific protections against discrimination by explicitly prohibiting discrimination against women with disabilities and requiring equal opportunities, access and benefits regardless of both gender and disability. The CRPD also does not include an express general duty to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women with disabilities.

In terms of specific rights, the CRPD protects rights to education, health, work, adequate standard of living, participation in public life, and freedom from violence and abuse for all persons with disabilities. However, within each of these areas, it could strengthen specific provisions focused on the rights and needs of women with disabilities...
