Immobilized enzymes are enzymes that have been attached or entrapped to an inert, insoluble solid matrix, such as alginate beads. By immobilizing enzymes, their reusability and resistance to denaturation increases compared to native enzymes. The immobilization protects the enzymes from shear forces, prevents unfolding, and allows for repeated use. Besides alginate, materials like agarose, silica gel, and activated charcoal can also be used to create immobilized enzymes. while immobilized enzymes typically have lower specific activity than the native enzyme initially, the specific activity remains more constant over repeated use compared to native enzymes that denature more quickly. The number of assays and reuses has a significant effect on the specific activity of both native and immobilized enzymes.  

EDTA is a chelating agent that binds divalent cations such as Ca2+, which are used to crosslink alginate beads. By binding these cations,  EDTA effectively breaks the matrix holding the enzymes, releasing them. Other chelating agents like EGTA and acid phosphates can have a similar effect. Immobilizing enzymes restricts their movement, which can affect how quickly they bind substrates to form enzyme-substrate complexes and release products. While this may slow down reaction rates, it often makes the reactions more consistent and accurate over multiple reuses.

In addition to alginate, other common materials for enzyme immobilization include agarose, silica, and activated charcoal. Agarose forms a gel at higher temperatures that  traps enzymes, then solidifies into beads as it cools. Silica binds enzymes through covalent bonds or adsorption, protecting them within a solid matrix. Activated charcoal also binds enzymes through adsorption and  protects them in small pores in the charcoal. These alternative materials provide more options for immobilizing different types of enzymes and working under various conditions.

While immobilized enzymes may have lower activity initially compared to native enzymes, their activity remains more stable over repeated use and during storage. The specific activity depends on the number of assays performed, and will decrease with more reuse due to some degree of denaturation over time. Although EDTA is commonly used to release enzymes from alginate beads for immobilization, other chelating agents can have the same effect. By restricting enzyme movement, immobilization may slow down activity rates but often provides more consistent and accurate results over multiple reuses compared to native enzymes. Overall, immobilization is useful for enhancing enzyme reusability, stability, and consistency.
