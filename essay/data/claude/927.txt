Recurrent falls in the elderly population is a serious issue that can impact health, independence, and quality of life. There are several potential causes for recurrent falls in the elderly that should be considered when diagnosing a patient. The most common causes include muscle weakness or balance problems, medication side effects, chronic medical conditions, vision problems, poor home safety, and cognitive impairment. 

To determine the cause of recurrent falls in an elderly patient, a comprehensive medical evaluation is required. For the patient in this essay, an 83-year-old woman who was admitted to the hospital after a fall in her home, the medical team took a full medical history and conducted a physical exam, neurological exam, and assessment of current medications. The patient reported two previous falls in the past month, difficulty walking long distances due to knee pain, and issues with occasional dizziness when changing positions. Her medical history included osteoarthritis, hypertension, and early-stage dementia.

Based on the evaluations, the medical team determined the likely causes of this patient's falls to be a combination of lower extremity muscle weakness and balance problems from osteoarthritis and age-related changes, possible medication side effects from her blood pressure medication impacting her blood pressure and increasing fall risk when standing, and cognitive impairment interfering with safety judgment. The patient's recent history of multiple falls also put her at higher risk of falling again, as recurrent falls can further diminish strength and balance over time.

For treatment, the medical team made several recommendations to help reduce this patient's fall risk and support her safety and independence. Physiotherapy and occupational therapy were ordered to help strengthen her legs, improve balance, and teach safe mobility strategies. Her medications were adjusted to optimize dosage and timing. Additional recommendations included using a walker for support, installing grab bars in the washroom, improving lighting throughout the home, clearing tripping hazards, wearing proper footwear, and considering the use of a personal alert system. 

The diagnosis and treatment plan for this patient focused on the multiple identified causes that commonly contribute to falls in the elderly. A multidimensional intervention approach provides the best opportunity for success in minimizing recurrent falls, allowing elderly individuals to remain as independent as possible for as long as possible. With appropriate diagnosis and treatment, the consequences of falls can potentially be avoided or mitigated in many cases.
