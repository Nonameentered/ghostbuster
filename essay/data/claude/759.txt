Determining the coefficient of friction between two materials requires carefully controlling potential sources of error and ensuring an accurate experimental setup. To find the coefficient of friction between a brass pin and a moving steel surface, the following methods could be employed:

A common approach is the inclined plane method. A block with a pin inserted is placed on a ramp at an initial angle. The angle of the ramp is slowly increased until the block starts sliding down. The angle at which sliding begins is measured. This angle corresponds to the coefficient of friction between the pin and surface according to the equation: μ=tanθ, where μ is the coefficient of friction and θ is the angle of the incline.   

To minimize error, the ramp and block should be precisely leveled and secured in place. The pin should protrude evenly from all sides of the block. The block should slide at a controlled, slow speed to avoid effects of inertia. The angle should be measured accurately using a protractor. Multiple trials should be conducted and averaged.  

An alternative is the horizontal force method. The block remains on a horizontal surface while a force gauge attached to the block via a pulley system applies a horizontal force. The force is slowly increased until the block begins to slide. The force required to start sliding divided by the normal force of the block (its weight) gives the coefficient of friction.  

Sources of error here include uneven application of force, imprecise measurement of the applied force and normal force, and uneven/unlevel surfaces. Using high-quality equipment, carefully leveling the surfaces, performing multiple trials, and averaging the results can minimize these errors.

For both methods, the coefficient of friction obtained would be considered accurate if the values from multiple trials are close to one another, standard deviations are small, and the results match theoretical expectations for the materials in question. If significant variability or outliers exist in the data, or if the coefficient of friction value does not match reference tables for those materials, then there may be uncontrolled sources of error or flawed methodology, indicating the value is not accurate.

In summary, by controlling variables, using high-precision equipment, repeating trials, and averaging results, reasonably accurate values for the coefficient of friction between a brass pin and steel surface could be determined using either the inclined plane or horizontal force methods. Comparing to reference values and evaluating variability/outliers in the data also indicate if the obtained coefficient of friction can be considered precise. With care and the proper experimental technique, these methods can yield quite accurate measurements of friction coefficients between materials.
