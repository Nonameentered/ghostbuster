The key components of ice cream are fat, protein, sugar, water, and air. These components interact to create a complex three-phase system. The fat and protein provide structure to the ice cream, while sugar lowers the freezing point of water.

Fat in the form of milkfat or vegetable oil provides creaminess and richness to ice cream. As the ice cream is churned during processing, the fat globules are broken up into small droplets that are dispersed throughout the mixture. These fat droplets form a separate phase in the ice cream and also help trap air bubbles, giving ice cream a light and fluffy texture.

Protein, especially whey protein concentrate, provides viscosity and aeration properties in ice cream. As the ice cream is churned, proteins denature and form a three-dimensional network that helps provide body and structure to the ice cream. Proteins also help trap air and fat droplets, contributing to smoothness and creaminess. The higher the protein content, the firmer the ice cream will be. 

Sugar, usually in the form of sucrose and/or dextrose, lowers the freezing point of water which allows ice cream to remain soft and scoopable at freezer temperatures. The sugar forms a separate syrupy phase in the ice cream. The amount of sugar impacts sweetness but also impacts freezing point, texture, and stability. More sugar will produce a softer, creamier ice cream.

Water forms small ice crystals during processing that provides a frozen structure in the ice cream. The ice crystals make up a separate solid phase dispersed throughout the ice cream. The size and number of ice crystals impacts creaminess and textureâ€”fewer, smaller ice crystals produce a smoother and creamier product. 

Air is incorporated into the ice cream during churning. The air forms small bubbles that make up a colloidal foam phase in the ice cream. The amount of air, known as overrun, determines lightness and volume of the ice cream. More air will produce a lighter, fluffier ice cream with more volume.

In summary, the interaction between fat, protein, sugar, water, and air phases creates the characteristic smooth, creamy, and airy texture of ice cream. Whey protein concentrate in particular helps provide structure, viscosity, aeration, and stability to ice cream by forming a protein network that interacts with the fat droplets and air bubbles. The end result is a frozen dairy dessert that balances richness and airiness.
