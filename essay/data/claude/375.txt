The Endosymbiotic theory proposes that some of the organelles present in eukaryotic cells, like mitochondria and chloroplasts, were once free-living prokaryotic organisms. This theory suggests that, early in the evolution of life, these prokaryotes were taken up as endosymbionts by other larger prokaryotic cells. Over millions of years of co-evolution, these endosymbiotic prokaryotes developed a symbiotic relationship with their hosts and eventually became the organelles present in complex eukaryotic cells today. 

The Endosymbiotic theory was first proposed independently by biologists Lynn Margulis and Konstantin Mereschkowsky in the 1960s. Prior to this theory, the origin of organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts was a mystery. These organelles have their own DNA, ribosomes, and membranes that differ from the rest of the eukaryotic cell. The Endosymbiotic theory provided an elegant explanation for these observations.

There are several lines of evidence that support the Endosymbiotic theory. First, mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own circular DNA that is distinct from the linear DNA found in the cell nucleus. The mitochondrial DNA also lacks histones, which are basic proteins involved in packaging DNA in the nucleus. Additionally, mitochondrial and chloroplast ribosomes differ in size and sensitivity to certain antibiotics compared to cytoplasmic ribosomes. These genetic and biochemical differences suggest that organelles have different evolutionary origins than the rest of the cell.

Second, organelles like mitochondria and chloroplasts replicate independently of the cell cycle and have their own method of division that involves constricting off portions of the organelle. This is more characteristic of prokaryotic cells than eukaryotic cells where replication is tightly linked to the cell cycle. Additionally, mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own ribosomes and tRNAs for protein synthesis, again pointing to origins more like a free-living prokaryote.

Next, the inner membranes of mitochondria and chloroplast have proteins and enzymes that closely resemble those found in original prokaryotic cells. For example, the mitochondrion uses proteins derived from alpha-proteobacteria in its electron transport chain. Similarly, chloroplasts use cyanobacterial-derived proteins in photosynthesis. These observations suggest the endosymbiont origins of these organelles. 

Finally, comparative analyses of mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes have revealed their close resemblance to certain groups of prokaryotes. Mitochondrial DNA is most similar to that of alpha-proteobacteria, while chloroplast DNA resembles that of ancient cyanobacteria. These similarities provide evidence that these prokaryotes were the ancestors of modern-day organelles through endosymbiosis.

In conclusion, the Endosymbiotic theory has significant evidence supporting the idea that mitochondria and chloroplasts were once free-living prokaryotes that were engulfed and developed a symbiotic relationship with larger prokaryotic cells over long periods of evolution. Through this co-evolution, these endosymbionts eventually became the specialized organelles we see in complex eukaryotic cells today. This theory has been fundamental to shaping our modern understanding of how complex cellular life evolved on Earth.
