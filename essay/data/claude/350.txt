The debate between Keynesians and monetarists over macroeconomic policy stems from differing views on the determinants of aggregate supply. Keynesians believe aggregate demand is the primary driver of supply in the short run, implying the aggregate supply (AS) curve is relatively flat. Monetarists counter that aggregate supply is determined by real factors like technology and input costs, so the AS curve is relatively steep. 

The original Keynesian model proposed a nearly horizontal AS curve in the short run, indicating supply responds strongly to demand and does not constrain output. Keynesians argue excess capacity and the ability of firms to expand production with little cost in the short run allow greater demand to stimulate higher output levels without substantial price increases. According to the Keynesian Phillips curve, inflation will only accelerate gradually as unemployment declines due to demand-pull pressure.

However, monetarists and critical Keynesians like Modigliani counter that real supply-side factors, not just demand, determine aggregate supply and inflation. The short-run AS curve is upward-sloping because higher demand cannot indefinitely spur greater output without triggering cost-push inflation. As demand grows, bottlenecks and resource constraints will cause inflation to rise before full employment is reached. The steeper the AS curve, the more inflation responds to demand and output growth.

Moderate thinkers have challenged the extreme Keynesian AS curve shape. They argue both demand and supply factors determine aggregate supply in the short run, so the AS curve is neither perfectly horizontal nor vertical. Adaptive expectations alter the relationship between demand, supply, prices, and output over time. Supply shocks like oil crises, policies that reduce production incentives, and cost-push factors also make the AS curve steeper. However, some excess capacity and idle resources still allow for a limited demand-pull effect on output in the short run.

The debate on the short-run AS curve shape has major implications for policy. If the AS curve is flat as in the extreme Keynesian model, demand management policies to manipulate aggregate demand have limited effect on inflation and can stimulate growth. However, if the AS curve is steep due to strong supply-side effects, demand expansion policies may lead to higher inflation without much output gain, reducing their effectiveness. 

In conclusion, the supply-side debate on the shape of the short-run AS curve and its determinants influences views on policy options to stabilize the economy. Moderate perspectives recognizing both demand and supply factors affecting aggregate supply in the short run provide a more balanced understanding of the relationship between prices, output, and macroeconomic policy. Overall, the short-run AS curve is neither perfectly flat nor vertical, but upward-sloping to a limited degree due to a combination of demand-pull potential and cost-push constraints.
