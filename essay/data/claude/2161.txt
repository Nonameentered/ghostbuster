Here is a draft 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

Child language acquisition and development is a complex process that researchers have studied for decades. Two of the main areas of focus have been how children acquire vocabulary and develop an understanding of word meanings. Researchers have proposed several theories to explain the rapid pace at which young children, especially between the ages of 2 to 6 years old, acquire new words and their meanings. Two of the prominent theories are the Fast Mapping theory and the Quick Incidental Learning theory. 

The Fast Mapping theory suggests that children have an ability to quickly learn the meanings of new words after limited exposures, often with only one exposure. The child creates an initial mental representation of the word's meaning, though it may not be entirely accurate. According to this theory, children can acquire up to 10 new words per day. The Fast Mapping ability allows children to rapidly map a word to a concept or object. However, their initial understanding may be incomplete or include inaccuracies. The meaning becomes refined over multiple exposures to the word used in different contexts.

The Quick Incidental Learning theory proposes that children incidentally pick up new words and their meanings in the course of interacting with parents, teachers, and other children, without direct instruction. Children are able to infer the meanings of new words based on the context and environment in which they encounter them. Their learning is thus quick and happenstance. According to this theory, children can learn up to one new word every 90 seconds. However, similar to Fast Mapping, their initial understanding may be incomplete or imperfect and becomes refined over time with increased exposure.

Both Fast Mapping and Quick Incidental Learning suggest that children have a remarkable ability to rapidly learn new vocabulary, though their initial knowledge may be imperfect. The implications are that children are primed to learn language at an astounding pace in an organic, naturalistic manner. Their language learning abilities do not require systematic direct instruction and happen fluidly in the context of normal interactions and experiences. However, children's initial word knowledge may include inaccuracies, and their understanding becomes more refined and complete over time through repeated contextualized exposures to new words.   

In summary, researchers studying child language development and vocabulary acquisition have proposed insightful theories, including Fast Mapping and Quick Incidental Learning, to explain children's abilities to rapidly learn new words. The implications suggest children are naturally primed to acquire language at a quick pace through incidental learning experiences, though their knowledge may be initially imperfect. Understanding these processes provides key insights into the phenomena of child language development.
