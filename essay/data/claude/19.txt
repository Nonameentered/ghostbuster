Here is a draft essay in 1500 words on the prompt:

The Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) was a militant suffragist organization founded in 1903 in Britain. Frustrated with the slow progress of reform legislation and patient campaign tactics of existing women's suffrage groups, members of the WSPU decided to take direct action to raise awareness of the cause and press for change. They were willing to engage in violent and radical acts of protest that shocked and galvanized the public, drawing tremendous attention to the issue of women's suffrage and greatly accelerating its momentum and progress. 

The WSPU was founded by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughters Christabel and Sylvia. They were frustrated with prevailing views that the voting franchise should only be extended to men, and with the glacially slow pace of legislative reform on the issue. Their militant tactics were controversial but effective. They disrupted political meetings, vandalized public property, and engaged in hunger strikes and other dramatic acts while imprisoned. These unconventional and even dangerous forms of protest electrified and polarized society, bringing the issue of women's suffrage to the center of public discourse.

The WSPU was particularly bold and radical in its use of the female body to draw attention to its cause. Members engaged in hunger strikes while imprisoned, subjecting themselves to forcible feeding, which was a brutal and dehumanizing process. They also protested outside Parliament and the prime minister's residence, chaining themselves to fences and going limp when arrested in demonstration of passive resistance. These graphic and theatrical displays put their bodies on the line to highlight the unjust denial of women's political rights and citizenship. They were willing to sacrifice their health, safety, dignity and freedom to advance their cause.

The militant campaign shocked Britain but was highly effective in raising awareness and sympathy for the broader movement. The WSPU's radical acts and the government's heavy-handed responses led to a surge of support for women's suffrage. Though their tactics were considered extreme and even dangerous by some, the WSPU's defiant spirit and refusal to be silenced resonated with many. They thrust the issue of women's rights into the spotlight and showed the depths of conviction and determination within the movement.

Overall, the militant campaign of the WSPU through its bold and unconventional tactics played a crucial role in accelerating the vote for women in Britain. By drawing sensational attention to the cause and intensifying the debate around women's suffrage, the WSPU dramatically increased the pressure and pace of reform. Their defiant and self-sacrificing protest highlighted the moral authority of the movement and the urgent case for change. Though controversial, their radical acts were a pivotal turning point in the long campaign that ultimately won British women the right to vote.
