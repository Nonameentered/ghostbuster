Ion exchange is a process whereby ions of like charge are exchanged between a solid and a liquid (aqueous) phase. The solid medium involved in the exchange is called an ion exchange resin or ion exchanger. It contains loosely held ions of opposite sign to the ions in the aqueous phase. When these phases come in contact, the oppositely charged ions in the solid and liquid phases are exchanged and thus separated from each other.

Ion exchangers employ charged groups attached to an insoluble solid matrix  to exchange ions of the opposite charge in a solution. They are classified as either cationic or anionic, depending on the sign of the ions they release. For example, in a cation exchange method, negatively charged groups attached to the solid matrix are exchanged for positively charged ions in the solution. Common ion exchangers include synthetic resins like sulfonated polystyrene resins. These are porous polymers containing charged sulfonate groups that can exchange cations like sodium and hydrogen ions.

As an example of how ion exchange can be used for separation, consider the case of isolating whey proteins from milk. Whey proteins like Î²-lactoglobulin are positively charged at the pH of milk. The first step is to pass the milk through an ion exchange column containing negatively charged cation exchange groups. As the milk passes through the column, the positively charged whey proteins will bind to the negatively charged solid matrix via electrostatic interactions, while other neutral or negatively charged milk components pass through. 

After the column is loaded with the bound whey proteins, a buffer solution with a higher concentration of counterions (like sodium ions) is passed through the column. The sodium ions will displace the bound whey proteins and elute them from the column, separating them from the rest of the milk components. The principle behind this separation is that the ion exchange groups have a higher affinity for the more highly charged ions. So when the sodium ions are added, they competitively displace the whey proteins from the ion exchange sites and release them into the eluent solution. By collecting this eluent, the whey proteins can be collected separately from the rest of the milk components using ion exchange chromatography.  

In summary, ion exchange is a versatile method for separating charged molecules and ions based on their interaction with opposing charges bound to a solid matrix. It has many important applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and related fields. The example of isolating whey proteins demonstrates how it can be useful for separating and purifying ionizable biomolecules on an industrial scale.
