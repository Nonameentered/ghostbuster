Globalisation refers to the increasing integration of economies around the world through greater movement of goods, services, capital and people across borders. This has led to greater interdependence of economies and a more interconnected global economic system. While globalisation has brought tremendous economic benefits, including higher economic growth, lower costs of goods and services, and improved living standards for millions of people around the world, it has also led to major disruptions and costs for some groups and communities. 

On the benefit side, globalisation has enabled global supply chains that lower production costs and increase efficiency. Companies can locate different parts of their business in countries that have a comparative advantage in that activity. This has translated to lower costs of goods and services for consumers. Global trade has also increased overall economic activity and growth. When countries open up to trade, they can specialise in what they are most efficient at producing and then trade for other goods and services. This division of labour and specialisation enhances productivity and economic growth.

Global flows of investments, especially foreign direct investment, have also increased during this period of globalisation. This allows companies to access new markets and cheaper sources of labour and resources. It also provides an influx of capital and technology transfer that can boost the economies of developing countries. At a social level, globalisation has led to greater cultural exchange and spread of new ideas across borders. This intermingling of cultures has enriched societies in many ways.

However, globalisation has also generated costs for certain groups and communities. Some jobs, especially low-skilled jobs, have moved from high-wage to low-wage countries, causing job losses and wages stagnation in some developed economies. While global trade may boost overall economic growth, the economic benefits are not evenly distributed across or within countries. There are clear winners and losers. Sectors that face greater foreign competition tend to lose out. 

There has also been greater volatility and interconnectedness of financial markets which can lead to economic crises spreading rapidly across borders. Some developing countries have become overly reliant and exposed to unpredictable global capital flows. This can undermine economic and financial stability. At a societal level, there are fears of cultural homogenisation and loss of diversity as globalisation leads to spread of dominant cultures, especially Western culture. This can undermine local traditions and values.
