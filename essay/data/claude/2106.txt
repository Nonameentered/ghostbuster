Mauritius' agricultural development strategy between 1970 to 2000 was focused on rapid industrialization and transitioning the economy away from dependence on sugarcane monoculture. The underlying paradigm was that agricultural modernization and diversification were necessary to boost economic growth, increase food security, and reduce unemployment. The outcomes of this strategy were mixed, with successful economic growth and industrialization but limited progress in agricultural diversification.  

At independence in 1968, Mauritius was a poor country dependent on sugar exports, with high unemployment and food insecurity. The government embarked on an export-oriented industrialization strategy to grow the economy, while also aiming to modernize agriculture and promote non-sugar crop production to address unemployment and increase domestic food production. In the 1970s, the priority was to boost sugar production through land redistribution, investment in irrigation and technology, and factory automation. Sugarcane production grew 4% annually in the 1970s and 1980s.

In the 1980s, the government implemented the Food and Agricultural Diversification Program to promote non-sugar crops, provide extension services, and improve marketing. The program had limited success, as non-sugar crops proved difficult to scale and faced competition from cheap imports. By 2000, the contribution of non-sugar agriculture to GDP was only 6%. However, food import dependence declined from over 70% in 1970 to 30% in 2000, indicating higher domestic agricultural production, especially livestock and vegetables. 

Mauritius’ industrialization strategy was very successful. Export processing zones attracted foreign firms, especially in textiles and clothing. Manufacturing grew over 9% annually from 1970 to 2000 and created many jobs, helping to reduce unemployment from over 20% to under 10% in 2000. However, the focus on industrialization meant agriculture received little private or public investment. Most agricultural R&D focused on sugar, and farmers lacked access to credit and technology to diversify into non-sugar crops.

In conclusion, Mauritius’ agricultural strategy between 1970 to 2000 prioritized industrialization and economic growth over agricultural diversification. Modernization of the sugar sector was successful but non-sugar agriculture diversified slowly. Economic growth reduced unemployment and food insecurity, but import dependence persists. With more balanced policies and greater investment in agricultural research, extension and marketing, Mauritius could have diversified its agricultural sector even as its economy grew through industrialization. Overall, the outcomes reflect the government's hierarchy of priorities at the time.
