Here is a draft 1500-word essay in response to the prompt:

Montaigne's preface "To the Reader" sets the tone for his writing in his Essays with its emphasis on simplicity and honesty. He states that his goal is to create an accurate self-portrait, not an idealized one. By acknowledging himself as the subject of his work, and focusing on his shortcomings rather than his strengths, Montaigne begins to build a modest and humble persona for his writing. This tone and persona are reinforced throughout the work, particularly in pieces such as "On presumption."

In "To the Reader," Montaigne states the purpose of his writing is to relay "here some traits of my character and my humours." He says he aims to "reveal myself wholly" honestly and accurately, "according to nature." Montaigne thus frames his work as a self-exploration and self-portrait, rather than as a display of eloquence or knowledge. By recognizing his internal states, thoughts and habits as the subject of his work, Montaigne adopts a humble approach. The knowledge and understanding he seeks to gain is self-knowledge, rather than mastery over some external subject.

Montaigne's humble approach is evident in his willingness to expose and explore his own flaws and failings. He says in "To the Reader" that he does so "carelessly and without artifice." His writing will be "irregular and fantastic" like his own self and thoughts. He will not cover his "wrinkles and spots." By exposing himself, flaws and all, Montaigne establishes from the outset that his Essays will be an honest self-reflection, not an idealization. His flaws and shortcomings are admitted throughout so that his writing can achieve accuracy according to "nature." This humility and honesty lend Montaigne's work an intimacy and relatability that appeals to readers.  

Montaigne's "On presumption" reinforces the humble, self-reflective tone established in the preface. "On presumption" explores Montaigne's tendency towards excessive pride and self-confidence in youth and his journey towards greater humility. He reflects that younger people often have an "excellent opinion of ourselves" due to lack of self-knowledge. But with age and experience, one realizes one's limitations and ignorance. Montaigne sees presumption as a fault and one that he was not immune to, saying "I felt its bite." By discussing and admitting to this flaw, Montaigne again achieves an honest and unpretentious self-analysis. Ultimately, Montaigne sees wisdom, virtue and happiness as tied to overcoming presumption and achieving self-acceptance of one's imperfection and mortality.

Through "To the Reader" and "On presumption," Montaigne establishes a humble and self-reflective style. By focusing on self-analysis and exposing his flaws, he crafts an intimate and relatable tone that shapes his work. His message is that self-knowledge and acceptance of imperfection are more valuable than an idealized self-conception. With this approach, Montaigne revolutionized the essay form and created a deeply personal form of philosophical introspection and wisdom that still resonates with readers today.
