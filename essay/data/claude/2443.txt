If tests conducted on a Shewhart control chart for means of a food packaging line show the process has changed, several things may have occurred to the production process. First, there could have been a shift in the mean, indicating the average output of the process has increased or decreased. This could be due to factors such as changes in raw materials, equipment wear or calibration, or environmental conditions. A higher mean could indicate the packages are overfilling, risking going over the upper specification limit. A lower mean could indicate underfilling, risking not meeting the minimum customer requirements. 

Second, there could have been a change in the standard deviation, indicating more or less variability in the output. A higher standard deviation means there is more inconsistency in the amounts of product being packaged. This poses risks of both underfilling and overfilling as the output swings above and below the target. A lower standard deviation is preferable as it indicates a tighter, more consistent process with less variability.

To determine the new mean and standard deviation, a minimum of 60 to 120 new data points should be collected from the changed process. These new values can then be used to calculate the mean and standard deviation for the updated process. The mean is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of data points. The standard deviation can be calculated using the STDEV function in Excel. Compared to the previous mean and standard deviation, the updated values can confirm whether a change has occurred and the amount of that change.

With the new mean and standard deviation, the level of risk of overfilling packages and exceeding the upper specification limit can be determined. By calculating the upper control limit, which is the mean plus three standard deviations, one can assess the likelihood of data points exceeding this limit. The higher the upper control limit, the greater the risk of overfilling. Actions may need to be taken to adjust and center the process to lower this risk.

In summary, analysis of Shewhart control charts that show a change has occurred should first determine if there were any shifts in the mean or standard deviation. Calculating the new mean and standard deviation with a sufficient sample size of new data can quantify the amount of change. Comparing the updated and previous values as well as the new upper control limit can indicate the level of risk of overfilling product packages. Appropriate adjustments should then be made to improve process control and lower risks to an acceptable level.
