The validity of an argument refers to the logical relationship between its premises and its conclusion, whereas the truth  of an argument's conclusions refers to whether those conclusions correspond to factual reality. This distinction is crucial in both mathematics and experimental science.

In mathematics, proofs rely entirely on the validity of logical reasoning. Mathematicians establish theorems by deducing conclusions that necessarily follow from explicitly stated premises and definitions. As long as each step in the reasoning is logically valid, the conclusion reached will be a mathematical truth, regardless of any connection to the real world. For example, mathematicians can prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers without measuring anything in the real world. The truth of the conclusion is determined purely by logical reasoning from premises. 

In experimental science, by contrast, validity and truth are both essential. Scientists develop hypotheses and theories to explain and predict real-world phenomena. No matter how logically valid the reasoning used to derive a theory, the theory cannot be accepted as scientific truth unless it is supported by evidence from observations and experiments. For example, in Einstein's development of the theory of special relativity, he started from premises he believed to be logically coherent and deduced conclusions using mathematically valid reasoning. However, the scientific community did not accept relativity as a true description of the world until astronomical observations and experimental results confirmed many of its predictions. Logical validity was necessary but not sufficient. Scientific truth requires both logical validity and correspondence to empirical evidence.

The distinction between logical validity and truth is also important because valid arguments can sometimes lead to false conclusions if the premises are untrue. And conversely, true conclusions can sometimes be justified by logically invalid arguments based on happenstance. Systematic progress in mathematics and science depends on combining logical reasoning and correspondence to reality. Validity without truth leads to abstract speculation disconnected from the world, while empirical observations without logical validity cannot lead to genuine understanding. Distinguishing arguments that are merely logically valid from those that are actually true representations of the world is key to advancing knowledge. Overall, while logical validity is essential for building coherent theories and models, determining truth is the ultimate goal of both mathematics and science.
