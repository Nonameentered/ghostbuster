Here is a draft 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

The themes of identity and displacement are explored in Louise Bennett's poem "Colonization in Reverse" and Helen Dunmore's poem "The Migrant". In both poems, the poets use striking language and metaphor to highlight how identity can be shaped and reshaped due to displacement from one's homeland. 

In "Colonization in Reverse", Bennett adopts a wry and satirical tone to discuss how Jamaican migrants in Britain start to affect British identity. The poem begins by depicting the initial journey of Jamaican migrants to Britain, "some colomen deh pon duplication/Dem a abandon dem colomen station". The "colomen" are abandoning their colonies andstations to duplicate themselves in Britain. The use of Jamaican patois here establishes the poem as giving a Jamaican perspective on British identity.

Bennett then goes on to show how the influx of Jamaican migrants begins to slowly transform British identity from within. She writes "dey 'ave some colomen subjects here...A Jamaica migrant deh ya not a tourist". The Jamaican migrants are now British "subjects", highlighting how migration leads to a mixing and merging of identities. British identity starts to incorporate elements of Jamaican language, cuisinue and dress. Bennett remarks humorously "de Englishman him food e cyaan done/Not a patty, not a bun". The Englishman has developed a taste for Jamaican patties and buns. There is also the adoption of Jamaican expressions and language, with "de new Briitsh" speaking in Jamaican patois. Thus, Bennett conveys how the displacement of Jamaicans has reshaped conceptions of Britishness. Identity is transformed through the blending of cultures.

Similar ideas are explored in Dunmore's "The Migrant" which depicts a migrant who "grafts" aspects of British culture onto her native identity. The "transplanted" migrant modifies her behavior and accent to assimilate into British culture, "I modify my accent, drop/my native expressions". This results in the creation of a "hybrid self" with composite aspects of Britishness and her native identity. However, this hybrid self suffers from feelings of displacement and discomfort, not fully identifying with either culture. The poem uses the metaphor of a "grafted fruit tree" to reflect this. Like the tree, the migrant's identity becomes a "strange fusion" of two cultures that she struggles to reconcile.

In conclusion, both Bennett and Dunmore demonstrate through striking metaphors and imagery how identities can be transformed due to displacement from one's native land. For Bennett, cultural influences move in reverse and Jamaican migrants colonize Britain, reshaping Britishness. For Dunmore, migrants develop a "hybrid self" that incorporates both native and British identities, at the cost of feelings of displacement and alienation. The poets thus highlight how intercultural contact profoundly affects conceptions of identity on both sides. Identities adapt, fuse and find new expression due to the mixing of cultural influences.
