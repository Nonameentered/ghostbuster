The Roman towns of Cosa and Emporion provide interesting contrasts in their layout and design. While Cosa, located in Etruria on the western coast of central Italy, had a regimented, grid-like plan typical of many Roman colonial settlements, Emporion, located in Spain along the Mediterranean coast, grew more organically over time with an irregular street plan. The modern approaches to excavating and studying these sites also differ significantly. 

The port town of Cosa was founded as a Roman colony in 273 BCE, with city planning that reflected key aspects of Roman urban design. Cosa was laid out on a rectangular grid plan, with a north-south oriented cardo maximus and an east-west oriented decumanus maximus. These two main streets intersected at the center of town, with the forum located at this junction. The street grid also incorporated two other decumani and several secondary streets. This orderly layout mirrors the military encampments that the first Roman colonists were accustomed to. The rigid geometry and strict hierarchy expressed in the plan conveyed the authority and order of the Roman state.

In contrast, Emporion in Spain began as a Greek trading port in the 6th century BCE and gradually developed into a Roman town over centuries of occupation. Rather than a single coordinated building plan, Emporion grew organically over this time with an irregular street layout. The earliest Greek settlement was located on the coast, with buildings spread along winding streets leading down to the port. As the Romans expanded the town, they added new stone walls, public buildings like a forum and amphitheater, as well as new neighborhoods - but these additions were made gradually without an overall geometrically regular plan. The street plan that emerged was labyrinthine rather than rigidly gridded.  

The modern study of these sites also differs significantly. Excavation at Cosa began in 1948 under the direction of Frank E. Brown and continues today, with a focus on revealing the entirety of the Roman town through systematic excavation block by block. The orderly nature of the architecture and layout at Cosa lends itself well to this approach. At Emporion, excavations since 1908 have also been extensive but more targeted, with a focus on key public buildings and areas of interest like the Greek and Roman ports, forum, and theater. The irregular layout and accumulation of layers over centuries at Emporion does not lend itself as well to a strict block-by-block approach. 

In conclusion, while Cosa and Emporion were both important Roman towns, they differed substantially in their layout, architecture, and construction. Cosa was built from scratch as a Roman colony with a gridded layout, while Emporion developed gradually from a Greek to Roman town with an irregular plan. Correspondingly, the modern excavation and research methods used at each site have differed, with a more systematic approach suitable for Cosa's orderly design and a more targeted approach tailored to Emporion's labyrinthine evolution over time. The study of these Roman towns provides insights into Roman urbanism as well as the methodology of archaeology.
