Geneticists have identified several evolutionary mechanisms and forces that determine how the frequencies of different genotypes in populations change over generations. The key mechanisms are natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, recombination, and sexual reproduction. 

Natural selection refers to the differential reproductive success of individuals based on the interaction of their phenotypes with the environment. Individuals with phenotypes that are better adapted to their environment will survive and reproduce at a higher rate, passing on their genotypes to the next generation. This will cause the frequencies of those genotypes to increase over time. Natural selection is a directional process that can transform populations by favoring beneficial mutations and adaptations.

Genetic drift refers to random changes in genotype frequencies due to chance events. In small populations, genetic drift has a large effect because a few individuals reproducing or dying can significantly alter genotype frequencies in the next generation. Genetic drift is a random, undirected process that can cause populations to fluctuate and lose genetic variation over time. It can also cause populations to diverge genetically despite living in similar environments, due to chance founder effects.  

Mutations are random changes in DNA that create new genetic variants and alleles in populations. The vast majority of mutations are neutral or deleterious, but some provide functional changes that can be beneficial. Mutations are the ultimate source of all new genetic variation in populations. Even though most mutations do not survive long, over vast expanses of time, the accumulation of rare beneficial mutations through natural selection is what allows for evolutionary adaptations and the formation of new species.

Recombination, or the crossing over of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, also contributes to genetic evolution by creating new combinations of alleles. This shuffles existing genetic variation in populations and increases the diversity of genotypes that can be subjected to natural selection. Recombination is critical for escaping the effects of genetic drift and maintaining variation in small populations.

Sexual reproduction itself can also influence genetic evolution. Sexual selection refers to the preferences of individuals for certain traits when choosing mates. This can drive the evolution of certain traits like brightly colored feathers or complex mating displays. Random mating between individuals in a population can reduce inbreeding and increase genetic diversity, providing more raw material for natural selection to act upon, even without the effects of recombination.  

In the absence of these evolutionary forces, a population's genotypic frequencies will remain at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium refers to the stable equilibrium of genotype frequencies in a population with random mating and no selection, mutation, migration or genetic drift. ...  The genotype frequencies can be calculated directly from the allele frequencies for the locus using the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium equation

In summary, natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, recombination and sexual reproduction are the five key mechanisms that shape the genetic evolution of populations by altering the frequencies of different genotypes over generations. Though these mechanisms differ in their randomness, directionality, and effects, together they have enabled populations to become adapted to their environments and diversify over immense periods of time.
