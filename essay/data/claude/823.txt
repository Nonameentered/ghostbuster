Myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow to the heart muscle is blocked. This is usually due to coronary artery disease, in which plaque builds up within the coronary arteries that supply oxygenated blood to the heart muscle. There are several risk factors for myocardial infarction, including high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, family history, and older age. The more risk factors an individual has, the greater their risk of a heart attack. 

The diagnosis of a heart attack is made based on symptoms, physical exam findings, ECG changes, and blood tests. The most common symptom is chest pain, such as pressure, squeezing, discomfort, or heaviness in the chest. This pain may radiate to the arm, back, neck or jaw. Other symptoms include shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, dizziness or fainting. On examination, rapid heart rate and abnormal heart sounds may be detected. An ECG will show changes such as ST segment elevation or depression, indicating heart muscle damage. Blood tests show a rise in cardiac enzymes like troponin, indicating heart muscle cell death. 

The aims of treatment are to restore blood flow, limit heart muscle damage, prevent complications, and reduce risk of future events according to guidelines set by the National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease. This includes treatments such as thrombolysis, primary PCI, anticoagulation and antiplatelet medications. Thrombolysis involves giving medications to break up blood clots in blocked arteries. Primary PCI or angioplasty is the temporary insertion of a stent to open the blocked artery. Anticoagulants like heparin prevent further clotting while antiplatelets prevent platelets from sticking together. Other medications for managing heart attacks and preventing recurrence include beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins and aspirin. Lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, diet and exercise are also important.

For chronic heart disease management in community or primary care, the aims are to reduce symptoms, prevent disease progression, reduce risk of complications and improve quality of life. This includes initiating and titrating medications as recommended, lifestyle advice, secondary prevention and monitoring risk factors. Medications used long-term include antiplatelets like aspirin to prevent clots, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors to lower blood pressure and improve heart function, and statins to lower cholesterol. Lifestyle changes revolve around diet, exercise, weight loss, reducing salt and alcohol intake, and quitting smoking. Regular follow up and monitoring includes blood pressure and lipid checks, diabetes screening and ECG. Patient education about warning signs and what to do if symptoms occur is also important.

In summary, the major risk factors for myocardial infarction include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking and age. Diagnosis is made based on symptoms, ECG changes and blood tests. Aims of treatment include restoring blood flow, limiting damage and preventing future events using medications, procedures and lifestyle changes as recommended in national guidelines. For chronic management, primary care focuses on secondary prevention through optimizing medications, lifestyle advice and regular monitoring to reduce complications and progression of coronary artery disease.
