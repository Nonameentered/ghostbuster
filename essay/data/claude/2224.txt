Dark matter refers to a type of matter in the universe that does not emit or reflect light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. Although scientists have not yet directly detected dark matter, we know it exists due to its gravitational effect on visible matter in the universe. There are three main discrepancies in astronomical observations that point to the existence of dark matter: the motion of galaxies in clusters, the rotation of galaxies, and the structure formation in the early universe.

There are two main types of dark matter proposed: hot dark matter and cold dark matter. Hot dark matter moves at relativistic speeds, while cold dark matter moves at non-relativistic speeds. The current cosmological model, the lambda-CDM model, proposes that most of the dark matter in the universe is cold dark matter. Cold dark matter best explains the large-scale structure that we observe in the universe today, including the cosmic web of galaxies and dark matter filaments that span the universe. 

The first indication of dark matter came from observing the motion of galaxies within galaxy clusters. Galaxies move rapidly within clusters, which would cause them to disperse if they only contained the visible matter that emits light. There must be a larger mass of invisible matter providing enough gravity to bind the galaxies together in the cluster. This observation points to dark matter.

The second clue came from observing the rotation of spiral galaxies. The outer regions of spiral galaxies rotate at similar speeds as the inner regions. However, based on the distribution of visible matter alone, the outer regions should rotate much more slowly. The only way the outer regions can rotate so quickly is if there is an additional source of matter beyond what we can see - that is, dark matter. 

The third indication of dark matter comes from structure formation in the early universe. There was not enough time for small fluctuations in the density of visible matter alone to grow into the large-scale structures we observe today. Dark matter provides additional mass and gravity to accelerate the process. Cold dark matter best reproduces the structures we observe, like filaments and voids.

The fate of the universe depends on the amount of dark matter and whether it reaches the critical density. The critical density is the average density needed for the universe to just eventually collapse under its own gravity. If the density of dark matter and visible matter exceeds the critical density, the universe will collapse in a "big crunch." If the density equals the critical density, the universe will continue expanding forever at a gradually slowing rate in a "flat" universe. If the density is less than critical, the universe will expand forever at an accelerating rate in an "open" universe. 

Current observations show the universe is mostly composed of dark matter and dark energy. While we don't yet know the exact densities, many scientists theorize that the universe contains enough dark matter and visible matter for a flat universe, even when considering the influence of dark energy. However, more precise measurements of the densities of these components are still needed to determine the ultimate fate of the universe.

In summary, dark matter refers to invisible matter that interacts gravitationally with visible matter. Astronomers have determined it exists through observing galaxy clusters, galaxy rotation, and early universe structure formation. The type and density of dark matter, along with visible matter and dark energy, determine the fate of the universe. Continued research into these mysterious components will provide insight into the ultimate destiny of the cosmos.
