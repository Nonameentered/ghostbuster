Here is a draft 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

Erving Goffman’s 1961 ethnography “Asylums: Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients” and Sam Porter’s 2006 critical realist ethnography “Critical Realist Ethnography: The Case of Racism and Professionalism in a Medical Setting” both employed ethnographic methods to study the social dynamics of total institutions—a psychiatric hospital and an emergency room, respectively. However, their studies were grounded in distinct theoretical frameworks and methodological assumptions, leading to divergent research foci and findings.

Goffman’s study was predicated on a symbolic interactionist perspective, focusing on how social interactions and meanings are co-constructed by individuals.  He adopted an interpretivist approach, aiming to understand how patients made sense of their own experiences. Goffman’s methodology involved participant observation and open-ended interviewing, without predetermined hypotheses, allowing concepts and theories to emerge inductively from the data. His research uncovered how institutional routines and stigma disrupted patients’ self-concepts and social relationships, leading to the internalization of the "patient role."

In contrast, Porter's critical realist ethnography was grounded in the philosophical assumption that there are deeper causal mechanisms generating observable events, which ethnographers should attempt to identify and explain. Porter began with a theory that institutional racism and unprofessional behavior contributed to the stereotyping and unequal treatment of minority patients. He then used ethnography to explore these hypothesized mechanisms, gathering data through observation and interviews. His findings highlighted how staff prejudices, lack of cultural competence, and the ER's chaotic environment jointly caused racial disparities in pain management and length of stay.   

In summary, while Goffman took an inductive, micro-level approach aimed at understanding how individuals create and navigate the social world of the asylum, Porter adopted a deductive, mechanism-based approach to theorizing and analyzing the roots of systemic discrimination and inequality. Goffman's research generated theories of how selfhood and identity are shaped by social contexts, whereas Porter’s work applied and extended existing theories about racial bias and healthcare disparities. Both studies demonstrate how the theoretical frameworks and methodological choices underpinning ethnographic research profoundly shape how phenomena are conceptualized, investigated, and explained.

The essay compares and contrasts Goffman’s symbolic interactionist ethnography with Porter’s critical realist ethnography. It analyzes how their distinct theoretical assumptions—interpretivism versus realism—and different methodological choices—inductive versus deductive, micro versus macro—resulted in divergent research foci, findings, and implications. The essay evaluates the studies' approaches and significance, while noting their shared use of ethnography to explore pressing social issues within total institutions. Overall, it demonstrates how methodology and theory constitute an interdependent relationship in qualitative research.
