The most likely diagnosis for Mr He's admission to the emergency department is acute heart failure exacerbation. Several factors support this diagnosis. Firstly, Mr He presented with shortness of breath, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea which are cardinal symptoms of acute heart failure. Secondly, he had jugular venous distension and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, indicating fluid overload and pulmonary edema consistent with heart failure. 

Mr He's medical history of ischemic heart disease and chronic heart failure also make acute heart failure exacerbation the most likely diagnosis. His previous echocardiogram showing reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 35% indicates significant systolic dysfunction, a major cause of heart failure. The likely trigger for his acute presentation is non-compliance with medications, as evident from his admission that he had not been taking his heart failure medications regularly due to financial difficulties.

While other conditions like anaemia and renal or liver failure could theoretically contribute to or worsen his symptoms, there is little evidence to support them as primary diagnoses. His haemoglobin level was normal, making anaemia unlikely. Renal failure can cause fluid overload and shortness of breath, but Mr He had normal renal function tests, with urea and creatinine in the normal range. Liver failure may lead to fluid retention and altered mentation, but Mr He did not have jaundice or hepatic encephalopathy. 

The mainstay of treatment for acute heart failure exacerbation includes diuretics, vasodilators, and inotropes. Diuretics such as furosemide help reduce fluid overload, while vasodilators like nitrates improve cardiac output and relieve pulmonary congestion. Dobutamine is an inotrope that can be used to improve cardiac contractility if blood pressure permits. Oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation may also be required to support respiration.

Mr He's chronic lymphocytic leukemia is unlikely to directly affect the management of his acute heart failure, but it indicates that he is immunocompromised. Care must be taken to monitor for and promptly treat any infections to avoid further deterioration of his condition. Chemotherapy may need to be postponed until his acute symptoms have stabilized. The heart failure team and haematologists should work closely together in optimizing his care.

In summary, the evidence points to acute heart failure exacerbation as the most likely diagnosis for Mr He's emergency admission, based on his symptoms, signs and medical history. While other conditions like anaemia and liver/renal failure are unlikely primary diagnoses, they may indirectly exacerbate his condition if left unoptimized. Treatment focuses on reducing fluid overload and improving cardiac function. Close monitoring and coordination of care is required due to his co-existing chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
