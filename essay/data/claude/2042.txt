The ancient Greeks held complex and sometimes conflicting views on fighting, warfare, and heroism. These differing views manifested in the characters and actions of several key figures from Homer's Iliad, including Achilles, Diomedes, and Hector. 

Achilles represents an exultation of martial skill and valor for its own sake. As the son of a goddess and the greatest warrior of the Greeks, Achilles fights for glory and fame above all else. When Agamemnon takes away Achilles' war prize Briseis, Achilles withdraws from battle in a rage over the insult to his honor. Achilles says he only joined the war effort against Troy to gain "spoils and glory," caring little for the overall Greek cause. His close friend Patroclus criticizes him for his wrath and pride, telling him "you have no kindness in your heart." Yet Achilles sees war as a path to eternal glory through great and violent deeds of heroism. His fate is to die in battle at a young age, gaining a glorious death that will be remembered in song.

In contrast, Diomedes represents a more civic-minded view of war and heroism. Although also an outstanding warrior, Diomedes fights for the good of all Greece and to honor the gods. He follows the commands of kings and works with other leaders. When the goddess Hera asks him to assault Ares himself, Diomedes readily agrees out of duty. He tells his friend Sthenelus, "we must not fail to seize our chance to capture Ares, whatever god he may be." Diomedes cares for his troops and fights alongside them, not solely for personal gain. His heroism comes from service to a greater cause.

Hector, the prince of Troy, embodies a third perspective that balances love of family and home with the call to defend them. As the leader of the Trojan army, Hector feels obligated to fight the invading Greeks. But he does so with a heavy heart, wishing he could spend his days peacefully with his wife and son instead of on the battlefield. Hector tells his wife Andromache, "for in my heart and soul I know that day is coming when sacred Troy shall perish." Yet he fights on for the sake of his people and their survival. Hector's heroism comes from sacrifice and moral duty. When Achilles finally kills Hector in battle, Hector's end is tragic but noble.

In conclusion, the Greeks viewed fighting, war, and heroism in complex ways. Achilles pursued eternal glory through valor and violence. Diomedes represented civic duty and service to a greater good. And Hector embodied the sacrifice required to defend one's home and family. Through these diverse characters, Homer's Iliad explores the tensions between self and society, duty and sacrifice, that remain with us still today. Overall the essay showcases how Greek culture grappled with these deep questions, even if a single and definitive view was elusive.
