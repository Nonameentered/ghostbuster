Virginity and purity played an important role in ancient Greek society and mythology. A woman's virginity was highly prized and virgin goddesses like Athena, Artemis, and Hestia were central figures in Greek religion. The importance of virginity reflected the patriarchal values of ancient Greek culture, where women were seen as the property of men and female sexuality was tightly controlled.

In Greek mythology, the virginal goddesses Athena, Artemis, and Hestia were held in high esteem. Athena, the goddess of wisdom, was considered a virgin and a champion of the idealized feminine virtues of grace, modesty, and restraint. Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, was an eternal virgin and fiercely guarded her own chastity as well as the chastity of her followers. Hestia, the goddess of the hearth, was regarded as a perfect virgin. These virginal goddesses represented idealized feminine virtues and purity, in contrast to sensual goddesses like Aphrodite who represented fleshly desires and carnal pleasures. The virgin goddesses were morally superior in the cultural imagination of the ancient Greeks.

For mortal Greek women, virginity was a prerequisite for marriage and a sign of virtue and purity. Upon marriage, Greek brides would dedicate their girdles, a symbol of virginity and maidenhood, to Artemis at her temple. Premarital virginity and faithfulness after marriage were expected of all respectable women. Extramarital affairs, for women, were grounds for divorce. Following her wedding night, a Greek woman could be subject to a gynecological examination to determine if her hymen was intact, proving she had indeed preserved her virginity and purity until marriage. 

This emphasis on female virginity and purity reflected the patriarchal values of ancient Greece, where men exercised control over women's sexuality and lives. As females were viewed as inferior to males, they were expected to remain virgins until transferred from their father's control to their husband's. Virginity ensured legitimate heirs and established status, as illegitimate children had fewer rights. The cloistering of women, restricting them to domestic spheres, and valuing their chastity, modesty and obedience were means of asserting male dominance. Their virginity and purity were tied to the honor and status of their male guardians.

In conclusion, virginity held a position of high importance in ancient Greek society and mythology. Virgin goddesses were venerated, and mortal women were expected to emulate these ideals of chastity, purity and virtue. A woman's virginity belonged not to herself but to her male guardians, reflecting the broader patriarchal values of the culture. Virginity symbolized morality, honor and loyalty, and its preservation was tied to the status and legitimacy of families and marriages. Overall, the emphasis on virginity reflected the inferior and subordinate role of women in ancient Greek society.
