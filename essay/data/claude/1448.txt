Here is a draft 3250 word essay in response to the prompt:

E.M. Forster is renowned for his novels that explore themes of human connection and personal fulfilment. In his works A Passage to India and Howards End, Forster employs symbolic imagery and metaphor to represent characters' struggles to overcome divisions of nationality, class, and prejudice in order to form meaningful relationships.  

In A Passage to India, Forster uses the Marabar Caves as a central symbol for the barriers that separate the British and the Indians. The Caves represent the vast cultural differences that the characters cannot traverse. When Adela Quested and Mrs Moore visit the caves, they are overwhelmed by the "echoes and emptiness" within, symbolizing their inability to connect across cultural barriers. The sinister atmosphere and "muddle" of the caves reflects the characters' prejudices and anxieties in encountering the unfamiliar. The Caves thus symbolize the gulf between the Anglo-Indians and the native Indians.

Forster suggests that this gulf can only be bridged through personal connections between individuals. The friendship between Aziz and Fielding represents the possibility for Indians and British to overcome divisions. Their friendship is a "private understanding" that transcends cultural barriers through shared kindness, empathy, and goodwill. However, their friendship is repeatedly tested by the prejudices of the society around them, represented by antagonistic figures like Callendar and Turton who are suspicious of any congenial interaction between Indians and British.  

Ultimately, Forster suggests that societal forces and man-made institutions perpetuate divisions more than natural human tendencies. The symbolic decaying bungalow of the Moores represents the gradual decline of the British Raj and its accompanying prejudices. Forster implies that fulfilment lies in embracing our shared humanity - as represented by the "universal sky and universal earth" at the conclusion - rather than arbitrary distinctions of race or nationality.

Forster's later novel Howards End also employs symbolic houses and buildings to represent the divisions of social class in turn-of-the-century England. The Wilcoxes' house Howards End represents the traditional upper class, while the Schlegels' London home represents the liberal intelligentsia. The Midlands roadhouse where Mrs Wilcox spends her last days represents the crossing of these two societies in a mystical and primordial landscape.
