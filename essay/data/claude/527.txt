The technical aims and objectives for the electronics team of a scoreboard project would be to design and build the electronic components required to power and control the scoreboard. The key objectives would be:

1. Select high-brightness LEDs or other display technology that can be clearly seen from far distances, even in bright sunlight or at night. The display needs to be visible to all spectators in the stadium.

2. Design the power system to provide sufficient and uninterrupted power to the entire scoreboard system. This would require calculating the power needs of all components and building in redundancy to prevent power outages.  

3. Develop the control system to enable easy updating of information on the scoreboard like scores, time remaining, advertisements, etc. The control system should allow for both manual inputs as well as automated data feeds to update the scoreboard.

4. Ensure all components are weatherproofed as the scoreboard will be an outdoor system exposed to rain, snow, and temperature extremes. All connections and cabling must be sealed from moisture.  

5. Conduct structural analysis to ensure the design of the physical structure properly supports the weight and wind loads of the large display screens. The structure must remain stable and secure to avoid any risks of the display toppling over or parts coming loose.

6. Select materials for the scoreboard structure and display panels that are durable, corrosion-resistant, and able to withstand impacts. Aluminum alloy or galvanized steel would likely be used for the main structure, while high-impact plastics would be suitable for the display covers.

In summary, the technical aims of the project are to develop a fully functioning outdoor scoreboard system that is structurally sound, provides clear and uninterrupted information to spectators, and is built to endure the environmental conditions at the stadium location. By focusing on power, display, control systems, structural integrity, and robust materials, the electronics team can fulfill the technical objectives to implement a state-of-the-art scoreboard solution.
