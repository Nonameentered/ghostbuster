What Accounts for the Differences in Offending Patterns Between Girls and Boys?

There are significant differences in the patterns of offending between adolescent girls and boys. Boys engage in higher rates of offending overall, as well as higher rates of serious and violent offending. While boys and girls may share some of the same risk factors for offending such as troubled families, poverty, mental health issues, and substance abuse, there are some key differences that help account for the gender gap in offending. 

One of the most significant differences is in socialization. Boys and girls are socialized differently from an early age in ways that promote or discourage aggression and rule-breaking. Boys are often socialized in a way that encourages toughness, dominance, and risk-taking. They are more likely to be exposed to and engage in rough physical play. This type of socialization is more likely to promote traits linked to offending like aggressiveness, impulsiveness, and defiance of authority. Girls, on the other hand, are typically socialized in a way that promotes social skills, empathy, and rule-following. They are discouraged from aggression and rough behavior at a young age. This socialization is less conducive to the development of traits associated with offending.

Peer relationships also differ in ways that impact offending. Boys are more likely to engage in peer groups that encourage delinquent behavior and offending. They are more prone to the influence of delinquent peers and peer pressure to engage in acts like vandalism, theft, and violence to gain status and respect. Girls tend to have peer groups that discourage rather than promote offending. They are more prone to conformity to peer pressure that enforces good behavior. While some girls do join delinquent peer groups, they tend to have less influence on offending compared to the peer groups that boys engage in.

There are also differences in access to opportunities and exposure to delinquent subcultures that can promote offending. Boys have more freedom and less supervision, so they have more opportunities to get into trouble and join delinquent groups. They tend to spend more unstructured time in public spaces where they can associate with criminal peers and learn patterns of offending behavior. Girls traditionally have had less freedom and independence, and less access to public spaces where they might join criminal subcultures or be exposed to opportunities for offending. This limits their chances of becoming involved in delinquent behavior, especially at a young age.

Mental health issues and trauma also impact boys and girls differently. Conditions like conduct disorder, ADHD, and PTSD are more strongly linked to offending for boys. While girls also suffer from these issues, they tend to manifest in less delinquent ways. For example, girls with conduct disorder are more prone to running away, self-harm, and suicidal behavior rather than violence and criminal behavior. The ways in which boys and girls act out in response to mental health and trauma is shaped by gender roles and expectations.

In conclusion, the broad differences in the patterns of offending between boys and girls are largely attributable to differences in socialization, peer relationships, access to opportunities, and the impact of mental health issues. These differences cultivate traits and expose boys to environments that are more conducive to criminal behavior and offending. Of course, there are many boys who do not offend just as there are many girls who do. But in general, the gender differences in how children are shaped and influenced as they develop into adolescents and young adults account for why boys offend at higher rates and in more serious ways than girls.
