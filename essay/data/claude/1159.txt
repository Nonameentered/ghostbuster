The purpose of the practical experiment on trypsin extracted from defatted soybean meal was to determine the effects of heating and protein inhibitors on the trypsin inhibition activity. Trypsin is an enzyme that helps digest proteins in the digestive system. Trypsin inhibitors are compounds found in some foods like soybeans that can inhibit the activity of trypsin, interfering with protein digestion. 

In the experiment, trypsin was first extracted from defatted soybean meal using a buffer solution. This raw extract exhibited high trypsin inhibition activity, demonstrating that untreated soybeans contain trypsin inhibitors. This extract was then heated to 80, 100 and 120째C for varying time periods to determine the effects of heating on trypsin inhibition activity. It was found that heating the extract to 80째C for 5 and 10 minutes caused a minor reduction in trypsin inhibition activity, while heating to 100째C for the same time periods resulted in an over 90% reduction. Heating to 120째C eliminated nearly all trypsin inhibition activity.

The extract was also treated with various protein inhibitors like EDTA, PCMB, TPCK and TLCK to determine their impact. It was found that the inhibitors EDTA, TPCK and TLCK had no significant impact on trypsin  inhibition activity. However, PCMB was found to substantially reduce trypsin inhibition activity, demonstrating that trypsin inhibitors in the extract likely contain sulfhydryl groups, which PCMB is known to block.

In summary, the experiment found that heating trypsin extracts from defatted soybean meal to sufficiently high temperatures can eliminate their ability to inhibit trypsin activity. The results also showed that certain protein inhibitors like PCMB can reduce trypsin inhibition activity, while others have little effect. These findings provide insights into methods for mitigating the antinutritional effects of trypsin inhibitors in soybeans.
