Here is a draft essay in roughly 2000 words on the topic:

How Apes Acquire and Use Language, and What it Suggests About Humans 

 Humans’ ability to acquire and use language is central to our cognition, culture, and society. Given the fundamental importance of language in the human experience, scientists have long been fascinated by the question of whether other animals, especially our closest primate relatives like apes, also have the ability to develop language. Experiments with apes like Washoe and Kanzi, who were raised in human-like environments and taught human language, provide evidence that apes have a capacity for language, though more limited than humans. However, theorists like Piaget and Chomsky argue that there are qualitative differences in the language abilities of apes and humans due to innate properties unique to the human mind.

 Washoe was a chimpanzee raised by Allen and Beatrix Gardner in a human-like environment in which she was taught American Sign Language. Washoe demonstrated the ability to learn over 250 signs and combine multiple signs into sequences that amounted to simple sentences. For example, Washoe signed “water” “bird” “drink” to describe seeing a bird drinking. While remarkable, Washoe’s language ability was limited relative to a human child’s. Her longest sentences were around 5 words, her vocabulary remained small, and her grammar minimal. The Gardner’s work showed apes have the general cognitive capacity for language, but there are limits to their ability.

 Kanzi, a bonobo studied by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, exceeded the abilities of Washoe. Raised in a human cultural environment, Kanzi learned language through immersion and observation rather than intensive training. Kanzi learned abstract symbols (lexigrams) that represented over 500 words. He demonstrated an ability to combine these into complex sentences, understand basic grammar, and even infer the meaning of new words. For example, when given a lexigram for “flugelhorn,” Kanzi retrieved a musical instrument, showing he understood it as something one plays music with. While impressive, Kanzi’s language remained less complex and sophisticated than a human’s.
