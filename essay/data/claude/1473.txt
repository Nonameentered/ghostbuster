Language and Form in Representing Love and Identity

The poems 'Remember by Linda France and 'Listen Mr. Oxford Don' by John Agard both utilize distinctive language and forms to represent complex dimensions of human experience. Specifically, they highlight the tensions between idealism and reality in love and relationships, as well as the challenges of manifesting one's authentic identity in an unimpeded manner. 

France's poem adopts an intimate tone through its use of the second person 'you' to reflect on lost love and longing for connection. The repetition of 'remember' in alternating lines reinforces this sense of nostalgia. Yet, the short, fragmented lines also signify the difficulty in reassembling memories, with the 'drifting' and 'blurring' of the past. The physical and temporal distance conveyed through imagery of 'faded maps', 'oceans' and 'light years' that now separate the speaker and her lover point to the impermanence of their relationship.

In contrast, Agard's poem utilizes repetition and rhythmic devices like alliteration and consonance to critique the rigid policing of language and identity by 'Mr Oxford Don'. The 'knocks and clicks' and 'cracks ...of whips' highlight the violence of this corrective regime, while the rhetorical question 'You want me to talk proper, like what?' exposes its problematic  presumption that there is only one 'proper' way of speaking. The poem's rhythmic, melodic quality stems from the Caribbean Creole that Agard strategically weaves into standard English. This fusion of linguistic and cultural traditions thus becomes a tool of resistance that asserts one's right to craft an authentic selfhood.

Both poems show how idealism tends to mask inherent flaws and fragilities in human relationships and systems of power. France's poem poignantly highlights how the dream of perfect, eternal love is ruptured by the vagaries of time; Agard's poem uncovers how the idealized notion of a standardized, 'proper' English is built upon the marginalization of diverse identities and forms of cultural expression. However, they also suggest that meaning can emerge through a humanistic embrace of life's imperfections. The memory of love continues to bring bittersweet solace, just as the intermingling of languages and rhythmic vitality of Agard's poem opens imaginative possibilities beyond rigid conventions.

In conclusion, France and Agard's poems demonstrate how language and form can compellingly shape ideas about love and identity. Their poems highlight the tensions between idealism and actuality through lyrical representations of relationships and cultural experiences. By critiquing power structures that impose limiting ideals, their poems ultimately point to the beauty of forging meaning from life's fractures and embracing plurality of identity and voice. Overall, this makes their works rich and compelling meditations on what it is to live, love and find oneself in the modern world.
