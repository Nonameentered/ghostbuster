Centromeric chromatin is the region of chromosomes that controls mitosis and forms the kinetochore, which holds the spindle fibers during cell division. Centromeric chromatin has a complex organization and structure in mammals compared to surrounding euchromatic regions of the chromosome arms. The centromere contains highly repetitive DNA sequences that are not well conserved across species, but certain key features of centromeric chromatin including histone proteins, nucleosomes, and the kinetochore complex are shared among mammals.

Centromeres in mammals are characterized by the presence of nucleosomes containing a specialized histone H3 variant called CENP-A. CENP-A replaces canonical histone H3 in approximately 10-30% of centromeric nucleosomes. The incorporation of CENP-A into nucleosomes at the centromere during replication marks it as the site of the kinetochore formation. Other histone modifications, including methylation and phosphorylation, also distinguish centromeric chromatin from surrounding euchromatin and help recruit kinetochore proteins. The presence of CENP-A nucleosomes interspersed with nucleosomes containing canonical H3 is distinctive of centromeric chromatin.  

Unlike the highly repetitive DNA found at centromeres, nucleosomes provide a conserved foundation for kinetochore assembly across species. Although the DNA sequences found at mammalian centromeres are not well conserved, CENP-A nucleosomes and certain other features of centromeric chromatin are shared among species. The kinetochore complex, which mediates attachment of centromeres to the spindle during mitosis and meiosis, is built upon this CENP-A-containing chromatin.

The kinetochore consists of over 100 different proteins that assemble hierarchically upon centromeric chromatin containing CENP-A. The kinetochore complex includes structural proteins such as CENP-C and CENP-T that directly bind CENP-A nucleosomes, bridging proteins such as the KMN network that connect multiple CENP-A binding sites, and motor proteins that attach spindle microtubules. Though the DNA underlying the kinetochore is rapidly evolving, kinetochore proteins remain well conserved across species due to their critical function.  

The organization and modifications of centromeric chromatin are strikingly different from surrounding euchromatin, reflecting its unique function. While euchromatic regions contain randomly packaged nucleosomes with a variety of histone modifications related to transcription, centromeric chromatin contains regularly spaced nucleosomes with CENP-A and distinct post-translational modifications aimed at recruiting kinetochore proteins. Furthermore, euchromatin typically contains a high density of actively transcribed genes, while centromeric regions are composed primarily of repetitive satellite DNA sequences. The differences in nucleosome composition, histone modifications, and DNA sequence together distinguish centromeric heterochromatin from euchromatin along chromosome arms.

In summary, centromeric chromatin in mammals has a complex structure specialized for forming the kinetochore and facilitating chromosome segregation during cell division. Though centromeric DNA sequences are not well conserved across species, certain features including CENP-A nucleosomes, histone modifications, and the kinetochore complex provide structural and functional conservation among mammalian centromeres. The organization of centromeric chromatin is distinct from surrounding euchromatin due its high density of nucleosomes containing CENP-A, post-translational modifications aimed at kinetochore assembly, and highly repetitive DNA sequences. Our understanding of centromeric chromatin and kinetochore structure provides insights into the mechanism of chromosome inheritance during mitosis and meiosis.
