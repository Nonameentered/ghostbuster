Companies exist within an external environment that shapes their competitive landscape. There are several key factors in a company's external environment that are important to analyze to better understand industry dynamics and competitive pressures. By thoroughly analyzing its external environment, a company can identify issues that may impact its competitive position and take strategic actions to strengthen its position relative to competitors.  

One of the most significant factors in a company's external environment is the industry in which it operates. The industry shapes the broad competitive forces acting on all firms within it. Tesco operates within the UK grocery retail industry, which is a mature, concentrated industry with slow growth, dominated by a few powerful companies like Tesco, Sainsbury's, and Asda. The dynamics of the industry, such as slow growth, limited product differentiation, and high fixed costs, drive the need for operational efficiency and keeping costs low.

The general economy also has a strong influence on a company's external environment. Macroeconomic factors like economic growth, inflation, exchange rates, and interest rates shape demand within an industry. For example, during economic recessions, consumers spend less, so Tesco may focus on value products and cost control. When the economy is expanding, Tesco can afford to invest in new stores and product innovation to capture growth.

Technological changes are another key factor, as new technologies can disrupt an industry by changing consumer behaviors or enabling new competitors. Tesco has invested heavily in technology to improve its operational efficiency through centralized purchasing and distribution, as well as improve the customer experience through options like online ordering, payment, and delivery. However, technology also enables new competitors like online retailers, so Tesco must continue innovating to adapt.

Demographic and social changes in a population can also impact a company's external environment by shifting consumer needs and behaviors. Tesco analyzes UK demographic trends to tailor product offerings to groups like the aging population or the increasing number of health-conscious consumers. Cultural shifts towards more sustainability and corporate social responsibility have also prompted Tesco to focus more on local sourcing, reducing food waste, and improving its environmental impact.

By analyzing all these factors in its external environment, Tesco can identify key issues  and make strategic choices to strengthen its competitive position. To address competitive pressures from rivals like Sainsbury's and Asda, Tesco focuses on operational efficiency, lower prices, and cost control...
