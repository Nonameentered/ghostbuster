The most likely diagnosis for a young man with longstanding depression and anxiety, jaundice, and a history of alcohol abuse is alcoholic liver disease, specifically alcoholic hepatitis. The differential diagnoses for his presenting complaint of jaundice include viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. 

On examination, findings that would support a diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, ascites, spider nevi, palmar erythema, and Dupuytren's contractures. Laboratory investigations would show elevated liver enzymes, especially aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), as these enzymes are induced by alcohol and markers of liver cell injury. Bilirubin levels would also be elevated, indicating cholestasis. Hepatitis serology and autoantibodies would be negative, ruling out other causes of hepatitis and autoimmune liver disease. Ultrasound of the liver may show changes consistent with alcoholic hepatitis such as a hyperechoic liver with enlarged caudate lobe.

Complications of alcohol withdrawal syndrome include delirium tremens with associated autonomic instability, seizures, and hallucinations. Other complications include gastrointestinal bleeding, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, and Wernicke's encephalopathy. The treatment for alcoholic hepatitis primarily involves abstinence from alcohol, nutritional support, and management of symptoms. Corticosteroids such as prednisolone may also be used for severe alcoholic hepatitis to reduce inflammation. Long term management involves monitoring for hepatocellular carcinoma and end-stage liver disease which may require liver transplantation. 

In the future, advances in the management of alcoholic hepatitis may include new pharmacological agents to halt or reverse the progression of alcoholic liver damage. These include farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulators, caspase inhibitors and stem cell therapies. Genotyping patients may also allow more targeted therapy with higher chance of success. Combined with increased knowledge about the mechanisms behind alcoholic liver disease pathogenesis, the field of treatments for alcoholic hepatitis may expand greatly over the coming decades.
