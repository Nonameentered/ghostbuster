Experiments were conducted in 1995 and 1998 to test the properties of selected carbon steel specimens obtained from the same manufacturing facility. Two experiments were performed in both years to determine the mechanical properties, including yield strength, tensile strength, and percent elongation. The results of the experiments demonstrated some variation in properties between the specimens from different years, indicating a potential difference in the manufacturing process or material composition.  

In 1995, six carbon steel specimens were tested for their mechanical properties using a universal testing machine following the ASTM E8 standard for tensile testing of metallic materials. The cross-sectional area of each specimen was measured to properly calculate the stress-strain properties during the test. Each specimen was loaded in tension at a constant strain rate until fracture. The load and elongation of each specimen were continuously measured during the test, from which the stress-strain curves were plotted and the yield strength, tensile strength, and percent elongation at fracture were determined. The average yield strength of the six specimens was 54.8 ksi, the average tensile strength was 76.2 ksi, and the average elongation was 23.8%.

A similar set of experiments was conducted in 1998 on another set of six carbon steel specimens from the same manufacturing facility. The specimen preparation and testing procedures matched those used in 1995. The average yield strength from the six specimens was 52.6 ksi, the average tensile strength was 74.1 ksi, and the average elongation was 25.2%. Compared to the 1995 results, the 1998 data showed a 3.6% lower yield strength, 2.7% lower tensile strength, and 5.9% higher elongation. These variations in properties between the two sets of specimens, though relatively modest, indicate a difference that could potentially be attributed to changes in the manufacturing process, alloy composition, or other factors.

To determine if the variations noted are statistically significant and represent a real difference in the properties, a statistical analysis should be performed on the full data sets from both experiments. A t-test can be used to determine if there is a significant difference between the mean values of the yield strength, tensile strength, and percent elongation from 1995 and 1998. The p-values from the t-tests would indicate whether the differences are statistically significant or likely due to random chance. 

In summary, mechanical testing of carbon steel specimens in 1995 and 1998 demonstrated some variation in key properties, including lower yield and tensile strengths but higher elongation for the 1998 specimens. While relatively modest, these differences could be indicative of an actual change or inconsistency in the material. To conclusively determine if the variations represent a real difference with statistical significance, a statistical analysis of the full data sets should be performed using an appropriate method such as the t-test. The results of such an analysis would verify whether processing controls or material standards require corrective action to restore consistency.
