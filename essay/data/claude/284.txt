Elected union representatives have long been used as a proxy measure for union support and influence. However, this measure is becoming increasingly inappropriate and limited. The number of elected union representatives has declined substantially in recent decades in many countries. While they remain dominant in some sectors like the public sector, in other industries their numbers have dwindled. This varying presence reflects the uneven influence of unions across different areas of the economy. 

The roles and responsibilities of elected union representatives also differ in important ways that complicate their use as a broad measure of union strength. In France, for example, comits d'entreprise or works councils have extensive rights to information and consultation but more limited negotiating rights. They provide an important representation mechanism for workers but have a more confined role than traditional trade union representatives in collective bargaining. Using the presence of comits d'entreprise alone as a measure of union influence risks overstating their power and understating the role of unions in wage and working conditions negotiations.

There are several factors affecting unions’ ability and motivation to organize workplaces that also undermine elected representatives as a proxy for union might. Unions face substantial barriers to organizing in some private sector workplaces, especially those that are smaller in size. The costs of organizing are often disproportionately high for the number of potential members. Unions also vary in their commitment to organizing, with some investing greater resources and priority to recruiting new members and gaining representation in previously non-union workplaces. Relying only on measures of elected representatives misses these differences in organizing capacity and prioritization across unions.

Recent data on comits d'entreprise elections in France highlight these limitations. While the CGT and CFDT unions have launched a joint initiative to gain representation in more workplaces, their success has been uneven. They have gained seats in some large companies but struggled in others and in smaller firms. Looking at elected representatives alone glosses over the substantial differences in the dynamics of union organizing—and ultimately influence—across diverse companies. 

In conclusion, measures of elected union representatives provide a partial insight into union strength but an increasingly limited one. They fail to capture the nuanced realities of uneven union presence across sectors, the diverse roles and responsibilities of elected representatives, barriers to organizing that unions face, differences in unions’ commitment to organizing, and the varied outcomes of organizing drives. For a robust view of contemporary union influence, elected representatives should be considered alongside other measures that incorporate these crucial factors. While still informative, elected representatives alone no longer suffice as a proxy for union power.
