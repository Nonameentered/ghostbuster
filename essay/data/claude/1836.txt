There are several standard methods used to determine the nutritional components of fish and meat products. For protein content, the Kjeldahl method is commonly used, where the sample is digested in sulfuric acid and the amount of ammonia released is measured. The amount of ammonia correlates with the protein content. The same digested sample can also be used to determine mineral content using techniques like atomic absorption spectrometry or inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. These techniques measure the concentrations of minerals like sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and selenium. 

To determine fat and lipid content, the sample is usually subjected to acid hydrolysis to break down the lipids into fatty acids. The fatty acids are then extracted using organic solvents like ether or hexane. The mass of extracted fatty acids indicates the total lipid content. More specific lipid classes like triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids can also be measured using chromatographic techniques. The water content is simply measured by weighing the sample before and after drying in an oven, with the weight lost representing water.  

For carbohydrates, the sample is first hydrolyzed in acid to break down polysaccharides into simple sugars, which are then quantified using colorimetric methods or high performance liquid chromatography. The two most common methods are the phenol-sulfuric acid method and anthrone method. These produce colored products when reacted with simple sugars, with the intensity of color indicating sugar concentration. Enzymatic methods using enzymes specific for certain sugars are also sometimes used.

There are a few possible reasons for discrepancies between the nutritional values found in this study and previously reported values. First, there may be natural variability and inhomogeneity in the samples, especially for biological materials like fish and meat. The specific diet, age, and environment of the animals can affect nutritional composition. Differences in sample preparation and storage methods prior to analysis may also lead to variability. 

Another source of discrepancy is inaccuracies and imprecision in the analysis methods themselves. All analytical techniques have some error and limitation. There may be variability between different instruments and operators. Standards and calibration procedures, if not properly carried out, can also introduce errors. Some nutritional components may not be fully extracted or hydrolyzed, leading to underestimation. Interfering substances in the samples can also sometimes produce interference and overestimation.

In summary, protein, lipid, water, mineral and carbohydrate contents of fish and meat are typically determined using established analytical techniques like the Kjeldahl method, atomic spectrometry, chromatographic analysis, colorimetric assays, and gravimetric analysis. However, inherent biological variability in the samples as well as potential errors and limitations in the analysis techniques can contribute to discrepancies between nutritional values reported in different studies. Accurate nutritional assessment depends on careful control and verification of both sampling and laboratory analysis procedures.
