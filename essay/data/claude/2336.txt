Human African Trypanosomiasis, commonly known as sleeping sickness, is a parasitic disease found in sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by infection with protozoa of the species Trypanosoma brucei, which are transmitted by the tsetse fly. The disease gets its name from one of its symptoms—disruption of a person's sleep-wake cycle. There are two types of the disease based on the subspecies of the parasite: Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense causes the East African form, and Trypanosoma brucei gambiense causes the West African form. 

The disease begins when an infected tsetse fly bites a human, transmitting the Trypanosoma parasite. The parasites initially multiply in the lymph nodes and bloodstream, which leads to a fever, headache, and joint pains—the symptoms of the first stage. As the infection progresses to the second stage, the parasites cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the central nervous system. This leads to more severe symptoms like confusion, reduced coordination, and the disruption of sleep cycles that give the disease its name. Without treatment, sleeping sickness is usually fatal.

There has been an increase in reported cases of sleeping sickness in recent years, from under 10,000 cases in 2000 to over 17,000 in 2009, according to the World Health Organization. There are a few reasons for this rise. First, greater population movements in central Africa have brought more people into close contact with the tsetse flies that transmit the disease. Second, political and economic instability in some regions has disrupted control efforts like tsetse fly eradication. Finally, co-infections with HIV are more common now, and HIV infection reduces immunity and makes people more susceptible to the Trypanosoma parasite.

To diagnose sleeping sickness, doctors first check for symptoms and history of exposure in endemic areas. They then use blood tests to detect the Trypanosoma parasites. The card agglutination trypanosomiasis test (CATT) is a simple blood test that can confirm an infection. For more accurate diagnosis, microscopic examination of samples of lymph node fluid or blood can be used to visualize the parasites. Parasite DNA can also be detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on blood or spinal fluid samples. Lumbar puncture is done to analyze spinal fluid for signs of central nervous system involvement.

There are a few available treatments for sleeping sickness. For the early first stage of West African type, pentamidine and suramin can be used. Melarsoprol, eflornithine, and nifurtimox are used to treat second-stage West African type and both stages of East African type. However, melarsoprol can have severe side effects. Newer, easier-to-administer, and safer drugs are still needed to effectively eliminate sleeping sickness.  

 In conclusion, sleeping sickness is a deadly infectious disease that is endemic to sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by parasitic protozoa transmitted through infected tsetse fly bites. The disease progresses from a fever and joint pains to a disrupted sleep-wake cycle, confusion, and lack of coordination as the central nervous system is affected. There has been an increase in cases due to greater population movements, political instability, and HIV co-infections. Diagnosis involves blood tests, microscopy, and lumbar puncture. Available treatments include pentamidine, suramin, melarsoprol, eflornithine, and nifurtimox, though improved drugs are still needed. More international support is required to curb the spread of this disease.
