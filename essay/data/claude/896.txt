The primary design methodology presented in the report is a systematic approach for developing a custom gearbox to meet a set of specifications. The gearbox was designed for an electric mobile robot called “Mbot”. The key considerations and steps in the design process were as follows.

The first main consideration was determining the required gear ratio to convert the high-speed, low-torque output of the motor into low-speed, high-torque movement of the robot's wheels. The target top speed of the robot was 0.5 meters per second. By calculating the circumference of the wheels and the speed requirements, the necessary rotational speed of the wheels was determined to be 31.4 revolutions per minute (rpm). The motor's maximum rpm was far higher at 200 rpm. Using a gear ratio formula, a 15.2:1 gear reduction was calculated to meet the needs.

The second main consideration was selecting appropriate shafts and bearings to handle the forces involved. The design calls for two solid steel shafts to transmit power from the motor through the system and two ball bearings to support each shaft. The bearing and shaft sizes were calculated using torque equations and by estimating maximum friction in the system. The shafts also had to incorporate keyways and set screws to attach the gears.

The third consideration was optimizing the overall size and configuration of the gears and gearbox to mesh efficiently while fitting in the allowed space. Spur gears were selected due to their simplicity and availability off-the-shelf. By experimenting with different gear sizes and configurations in Solidworks, a three-stage, 15.2:1 gear reduction set was developed, using a large 24-tooth primary gear and a small 9-tooth tertiary gear.

The final steps were modeling the assembly in Solidworks, followed by simulations to evaluate any issues. The design was then further improved and optimized through an iterative process. The final gearbox design and simulation results indicate the design is sufficient for the needs of the Mbot application. The gearbox should convert the high-speed, low-torque motor output into low-speed, high-torque movement of the robot's wheels, allowing it to achieve a top speed of 0.5 meters per second.
