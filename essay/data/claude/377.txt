Genetic recombination refers to the rearrangement of DNA sequences during DNA replication and repair. In bacteria, there are two primary forms of recombination: homologous and non-homologous recombination. Homologous recombination involves the exchange of DNA sequences between two similar or identical DNA molecules. Non-homologous recombination, on the other hand, joins pieces of unrelated DNA together. 

Homologous recombination requires extensive sequence homology, or similarity, between the two recombining DNA molecules. It is initiated by a double-strand break in one DNA molecule. The broken ends are resected to produce 3' single-stranded overhangs. The RecBCD enzyme complex binds to the broken DNA ends and unwinds the double helix to facilitate annealing of complementary single strands. The RecA protein then catalyzes strand invasion, in which one single-stranded DNA end displaces the complementary strand in the intact double-helixed DNA. A D-loop structure is formed, and DNA replication proceeds to copy the intact DNA molecule.  Resolution then occurs, exchanging the DNA sequences flanking the break and repairing the broken DNA molecule.

In contrast, non-homologous recombination joins two unrelated DNA sequences together, mediated by transposases and site-specific recombinases like the lambda integrase. No sequence homology is required, so DNA strands with different sequences can be joined. This process proceeds via a cut-and-paste mechanism rather than strand invasion and replication. 

Bacteriophage recombination utilizes a significantly different mechanism than homologous recombination in bacteria like E. coli. During lytic infection, bacteriophages take control of the host replication machinery to produce new phages. As phage DNA is replicated, homologous recombination can occur between repeated sequences in the phage genome. However, phage recombination is not mediated by RecBCD and RecA and does not generate the same recombination intermediates. Phage recombination is also not linked to DNA repair, as it proceeds during normal DNA replication rather than in response to DNA damage.

In summary, genetic recombination in bacteria can occur through homologous recombination, which repairs DNA and exchanges flanking sequences, or through non-homologous recombination, which joins unrelated DNA pieces. Homologous recombination requires specialized enzymes like RecBCD and RecA, while non-homologous recombination uses transposases and integrases. Bacteriophage recombination proceeds through a distinct mechanism during viral DNA replication. These differences have important implications for DNA repair, genetic diversity, horizontal gene transfer, and viral infection lifecycles.
