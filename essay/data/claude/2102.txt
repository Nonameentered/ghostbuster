Here is a 1000 word essay response to the prompt:

The English noun phrase (NP) fulfills several functions within a clause. Primarily, it serves as the subject or object of a sentence, specifying the entities that perform or are affected by the verb's action. The head noun is the central component of the NP that determines its syntactic category and properties. Surrounding the head noun in the NP are modifiers that provide more information about the noun, including:

Determiners: Determiners are words like "the", "a", "this", "some" that come at the start of the NP and specify the definiteness, quantity, and demonstrativeness of the noun. There are several rules for determiner inclusion and placement. First, most nouns require a determiner to be grammatical, except for plurals, mass nouns, and proper nouns. Second, only one determiner is allowed per NP. Third, the determiner must come immediately before any adjectives or other modifiers. Finally, determiners can co-occur in limited ways, e.g. "all the books" but not *"the all books". 

Adjectives: Adjectives are words like "big", "beautiful", "red" that modify the noun by providing descriptive attributes and additional information. They follow the determiner and usually come before other modifiers. There can be multiple adjectives in an NP, in which case there are ordering rules based on categories like size, age, color, origin, and material.

Prepositional phrases: Prepositional phrases start with a preposition like "in", "of", "with" and end with an object NP or pronoun. They function as adverbial or adjectival modifiers by indicating location, possession, accompaniment, attribute, or comparison. Prepositional phrases follow determiners and adjectives. 

Relative clauses: Relative clauses begin with a relative pronoun like "who", "which", "that" and also act as adjectival modifiers. They follow the prepositional phrases in the NP.  

Demonstratives: Demonstratives like "this", "that", "these", "those" specify the location of the noun in space or time. They precede other determiners but follow most other modifiers.

The determiners, modifiers, and other parts of speech in an NP work together to provide a rich semantic description of the head noun by denoting attributes, qualities, quantities, possession, location, and more. Their ordering follows strict grammatical rules to avoid ambiguity and convey the intended meaning. The ability to complexly modify nouns with multiple specifiers is a key feature of English grammar.
