The theme of the lack of understanding between father and son, which ultimately leads to tragedy, is a key theme explored in Sophocles' 'Antigone'. This theme is also similarly examined in other famous Greek tragedies, such as Euripides' 'Hippolytus' and Aeschylus' 'Agamemnon'. 

In 'Antigone', Creon and his son Haemon share a disjointed relationship which arises from a lack of understanding and ability to see each other's perspectives. Creon refuses to listen to anyone else's views and sticks stubbornly to his own decisions, even when warned by the seer Tiresias that his actions will lead to tragedy. His son Haemon tries in vain to reason with him and get him to understand Antigone and not punish her so harshly for burying her brother Polyneices. However, Creon remains unwilling to listen, paranoid that any other view but his own is a challenge to his power and authority. Their lack of understanding and unwillingness to compromise leads to Haemon's suicide and Antigone's death, ultimately destroying Creon.

A similar theme is evident in 'Hippolytus', where Theseus wrongly believes that his son Hippolytus has committed the heinous crime of incest with his new wife, Phaedra. Despite Hippolytus' protests of innocence, Theseus refuses to believe him, put under a spell by the vengeful goddess Aphrodite. Their lack of understanding, trust and communication leads to Hippolytus' tragic death after being cursed by his father. By the time Theseus realises the truth, it is too late, and he is left full of regret at not having listened to his son.

Finally, in 'Agamemnon', Agamemnon shows a lack of care and understanding for the feelings of his daughter Iphigenia and son Orestes. He chooses to sacrifice Iphigenia to allow his troops to sail to Troy, not anticipating how much this would traumatize his son. Similarly, he does not expect that his murder by Clytemnestra and her lover upon his return from Troy would drive Orestes to avenge him. The lack of understanding in their familial relationships, especially between Agamemnon and Orestes, leads to a cycle of violence and revenge.

In conclusion, the theme of the lack of understanding between father and son which results in tragedy is a key theme in 'Antigone' as well as these other famous Greek tragedies. By exploring the characterisation of the father figures, Creon, Theseus and Agamemnon, and their relationships with their sons, the playwrights demonstrate the importance of open communication, trust and empathy within familial relationships.
