Teachers face many challenges when instructing students on grammar, especially when those students speak a variety of first languages. Interference from students' L1 can pose problems for learning certain grammatical structures in the L2, such as the Present Perfect tense in English. Teachers must find ways to address these challenges to effectively teach grammar to their diverse, multilingual students.

One of the biggest difficulties for teachers is overcoming the interference of students' first languages. When the structure or rules of a grammatical tense in the L1 and L2 do not match up, it can be hard for students to learn the L2 structure. For example, many languages lack an equivalent of the Present Perfect tense in English, which expresses actions that started in the past but continue into the present. Students whose L1 does not have this concept may struggle to understand when and why the Present Perfect is used in English. 

To address this, teachers should thoroughly explain the rules and uses of the Present Perfect, with plenty of examples. Comparing the Present Perfect to other tenses, like the Simple Past and Simple Present, can help illustrate when it should be used. Teachers can also explain that the Present Perfect suggests a present relevance of a past action. Providing translations of short texts using the different tenses into students' L1 can be useful for contrasting the meanings. With regular practice in context, students can overcome L1 interference.

Another challenge for teachers is deciding which course materials will suit a diverse, multilingual group of students. Most standardized textbooks are aimed at monolingual students and may not adequately address the needs of multilingual learners. Teachers want materials that will be accessible yet challenging for students of all language backgrounds. For a group of adolescent students with various L1s, a textbook series like National Geographic Learning's Life or Choices would be appropriate. 

These textbooks provide grammar instruction and practice while also focusing on other language skills, as well as real-world themes to engage students. They include specific sections addressing potential L1 interference for certain features like the Present Perfect tense. The reading and listening materials also represent a range of genres and global English accents. These types of textbooks, tailored to multilingual learners, give teachers a solid foundation on which to build their instruction and help diverse students understand English grammar.

In conclusion, while teachers face significant challenges in teaching grammar to multilingual students, especially regarding interference from students' L1, there are steps they can take to address these obstacles. Thorough explanations, comparisons, examples, practice, and suitable course materials can all help students, including those with first languages lacking a Present Perfect tense, to learn this and other grammatical structures in English. With hard work and the right resources, teachers of diverse, adolescent students can achieve success in teaching English grammar.
