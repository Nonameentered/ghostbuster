Manufacturing strategy refers to the set of decisions that shape the capabilities and competitive priorities of a company's manufacturing functions. An effective manufacturing strategy aligned with a company's business strategy can provide a competitive advantage. For example, a company aiming to compete on cost leadership would adopt a manufacturing strategy focused on high volume, standardized processes, and cost minimization. In contrast, a company competing on product innovation and customization would focus its manufacturing strategy on flexibility, agility, and speed to adapt to changing customer needs.  

When implementing a new manufacturing strategy, companies must address human and organizational factors to succeed. One key challenge is gaining buy-in from employees and overcoming resistance to change. Tools such as Force Field Analysis can help identify obstacles and facilitators of the new strategy. For example, a new automation initiative may face resistance due to fears of job losses but may be facilitated by incentives for retraining. Communication, education, and stakeholder engagement are critical to overcoming resistance and fostering support for the new strategy.

Selection and training are also important supplement strategies. When hiring, companies should evaluate candidates based on both technical skills and adaptability to the new strategy. Existing employees may need retraining and development to update their skills. Cross-functional job rotation and training can also strengthen understanding of the new strategy across the organization. These human resource strategies, combined with leadership support, help ensure the company has the right talent and capabilities to execute the manufacturing strategy.

Despite best efforts, problems can still emerge during implementation. Unforeseen technical issues may require troubleshooting and adjustment of timelines or  processes. Economic shifts can also impact the viability of the new strategy. Companies should build monitoring mechanisms to quickly detect issues and make corrections to the implementation process or strategy as needed in response to both internal and external challenges. With strong leadership, stakeholder support, adaptive talent, and a willingness to learn and adjust, companies can successfully implement manufacturing strategies that provide a competitive advantage.
