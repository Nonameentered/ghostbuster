The focus of this investigation is to explore the bonding characteristics of substituted derivatives of molybdenum hexacarbonyl, Mo(CO)6. This parent compound has a triply-eclipsed octahedral geometry, in which each of the carbonyl ligands symmetrically coordinates to the Mo center. Upon substitution of one or more of the CO ligands with other groups X, the geometry and bonding of the molecule is significantly disturbed. 

The strategies involved in bonding of substituted Mo(CO)6 derivatives involve both σ-donation and π-backdonation. The carbonyl ligands act as strong σ-donors to the empty Mo 5d orbitals, providing electron density to the metal center. At the same time, the filled 2π* orbitals of the CO ligands engage in π-backdonation with the Mo 4d orbitals, resulting in electron density transfer back to the ligands. This synergistic bonding strategy results in the well-known triple bond character of carbonyl bonds. Upon substitution, the σ-donating ability and π-accepting ability of the new ligands determine how the electron density is redistributed and the degree of π-backdonation to the remaining CO ligands.

The energy levels and vibrations of the molecules are impacted by the bonding strategies and symmetry. Group theory predicts the number of vibrational modes in the IR and Raman spectra based on the molecular symmetry. For the octahedral Mo(CO)6, group theory anticipates 12 fundamental vibrations: 6 Mo-C stretches, 3 in-plane bends, and 3 out-of-plane bends. Substitution lowers the symmetry, resulting in the activation of previously forbidden IR transitions and the appearance of new bands. Changes in geometry can also result in different   vibrations of the CO ligands and shifts in their νCO frequencies. Such shifts provide insight into the electron donation or withdrawal by the new ligand X.

Several experimental techniques provide evidence for the delocalized bonding in these complexes. IR spectra demonstrate the significance of π-backdonation through the characteristic νCO stretches. As π-backdonation increases, the νCO frequency decreases, indicating a weakening of the C≡O bond. NMR spectra provide information on the electron density around the Mo center through the chemical shift values. More electron density results in greater shielding of the Mo nucleus and a more downfield chemical shift. X-ray diffraction data reveal the geometry about the Mo center and provide Mo-X and Mo-CO bond distances, which reflect the relative electron donation or withdrawal by the X and CO ligands.

In summary, the practical investigation explores the electronic structure and bonding in substituted Mo(CO)6 derivatives. The bonding strategies of σ-donation and π-backdonation result in delocalized electron density and a synergistic interaction between the metal center and the ligands. Several experimental techniques, analyzed through the lens of molecular orbital theory and group theory, provide evidence for the electronic structure and allow comparisons of bonding between different derivatives.
