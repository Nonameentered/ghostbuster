Cosmopolitanism envisions a world of peaceful global governance under unified moral laws of common humanity. However, there are several challenges to realizing cosmopolitan ideals in today's globalized world. 

On the one hand, globalization has enabled cosmopolitan values to spread through increasing global connectivity, multicultural exchanges and worldwide access to information. The interdependence of countries through trade and cooperation has fostered a sense of shared interests and destiny among nations. Global governance institutions like the UN have provided mechanisms for countries to come together around common causes such as environmental protection, global health issues and human rights. These developments point to the feasibility of greater cosmopolitan cooperation at a global scale.

On the other hand, cosmopolitanism faces substantial obstacles. There are ethical dilemmas in moral universalism, especially in reconciling cultural relativism with universal norms. Local cultural traditions are hard to supplant with cosmopolitan values. People remain predominantly attached to their national or ethnic identities, limiting their sense of moral obligation to foreigners or humanity as a whole. Strong opposition to immigration and global governance also reveals the prevailing desire to protect national sovereignty and community interests. 

The institutional dimension of cosmopolitan democracy is currently more developed than its ethical dimension. While multilateral institutions have expanded, people's circle of moral concern is still largely limited to their immediate community. Rethinking political communities and democracy is key to cultivating cosmopolitan sensibilities. One approach is to build transnational or global civic identities through cosmopolitan education and emphasizing shared histories of cooperation. Another is to make global institutions more democratic and accountable to ordinary citizens across the world. This can help foster a global citizenry willing to accept common moral responsibilities.

In conclusion, there are good reasons for both pessimism and optimism regarding the prospects of cosmopolitanism. Pragmatic cooperation on global issues can continue even without a universally shared moral ethos. However, the full realization of cosmopolitan ideals still requires profound transformations in how people conceive of political communities and their obligations to humanity as a whole. While globalization provides the preconditions for greater cosmopolitanism, much work remains in addressing its ethical challenges and limits. Overall, cosmopolitan democracy is an ongoing project that deserves sustained efforts to build.
