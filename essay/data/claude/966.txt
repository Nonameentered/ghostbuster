John Locke, the 17th-century English philosopher, developed a theory of property rights that emphasized natural rights and labor as the basis for ownership and accumulation of property. For Locke, individuals had a natural right to own property that they mixed their labor with. By expending effort to work the land or transform raw materials into usable goods, individuals establish a connection with and make a claim over that property. In Locke's words from his Second Treatise of Government, "As much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of, so much is his property."

Locke's theory of property was ideal for an economy largely based on subsistence agriculture and barter exchange. In such an economy, most property took the form of land, crops, livestock, and simple tools or crafts. Individuals could readily establish their claim to property through direct labor and use of the land or goods. They produced largely for their own consumption or to barter for other necessities, so the amount of property was limited to what could be used and exchanged. 

With the rise of a monetary economy based on commercial production, trade, and wage labor, however, Locke's theory required adaptation. In an economy with a developed division of labor, complex manufacturing, interregional trade, and monetary exchange, property took on new forms like financial instruments, business enterprises, patents or copyrights. Not all of this property could be readily linked to an individual's direct labor or use. Much property was held not for personal use but solely as an investment or commercial asset.

To accommodate these changes, Locke's followers modified his theory in a few key ways. First, they expanded the notion of "mixing one's labor" to include not just physical labor but also intellectual and entrepreneurial effort. By innovating, organizing production, or managing a business, individuals could establish a claim to the resulting property. Second, they recognized that in a monetary economy, a significant portion of one's property was not intended for personal use or consumption but rather for exchange to acquire other necessities and wants. One could accumulate property through productive activity well beyond what one could personally use. 

Finally, Locke's followers incorporated the role of voluntary exchange and consent in property claims. If individuals willingly traded the product of their labor or entrepreneurship in a free market in exchange for money or other property, that should be seen as validating their original claim to that property. Through such mechanisms, Locke's natural rights justification of property on the basis of labor came to support an economy based on commerce, entrepreneurship, investment, and private ownership of the means of production. In this way, Locke's theory of property and its connection to individual labor and consent provided a philosophical foundation for capitalist economies.
