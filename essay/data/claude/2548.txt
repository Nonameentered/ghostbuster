Here is a draft 2750-word essay in response to the prompt:

The United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) was developed in the 1990s to guide conservation efforts across the UK to protect and enhance biodiversity. The UK BAP sets out specific actions and targets for priority habitats and species, including 25 priority mammal species and groups. The key goals for these priority mammals are:

1) Halt the decline and start recovery of declining populations. Some of the priority mammal species have seen substantial population declines in the 20th century, such as the red squirrel, wildcat, and dormouse. The UK BAP aims to stop these declines and support the recovery of populations through actions like controlling predators, improving habitat connectivity, and reintroducing populations.  

2) Maintain and expand the range of stable populations. For other priority mammals with currently stable populations, such as otters, pine martens, and bats, the goal is to maintain habitat and protections to keep populations stable and also expand ranges where possible through reintroductions and habitat improvements. 

3)Meet international responsibilities. Some UK mammals like cetaceans (dolphins, whales, and porpoises) are protected under international conventions that the UK has agreed to uphold. The UK BAP aims to fulfill these commitments with actions to reduce threats, better understand populations, and protect important habitats.

In the county of Berkshire, located west of London, these national goals are implemented at a local level. For example, to recover declining dormouse populations, conservation groups work to connect and expand woodland habitats, set up nest boxes, and control predators. To support otters, river habitats are improved by installing otter holts and controlling pollution. For bats, protection and expansion of roosting habitat is prioritized, especially as many bat species roost in old buildings.

Other initiatives in Berkshire include projects to help recover water vole populations through habitat improvement and American mink control. Pine marten recovery is supported by providing nest boxes in suitable woodland habitat. And although absent for over a century, wildcats are being reintroduced through a captive breeding and release program. These efforts show how broader national goals for priority UK mammals are achieving results at a local level through targeted conservation action, cooperation, and partnerships between government agencies, local authorities, conservation charities, landowners, and private individuals in communities like Berkshire. Overall, the UK BAP provides an effective framework for guiding and accomplishing mammal conservation in the UK, from high-level national goals down to work on the ground in local communities. With continued action and support, many priority UK mammals can recover, expand their ranges, and thrive over the long term.
