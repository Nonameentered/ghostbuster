Establishing a duty of care in cases of pure economic loss arising from negligent mis-statement requires meeting several criteria. The first criterion is reasonable foreseeability - whether the defendant could reasonably foresee that the claimant would rely on the mis-statement and potentially suffer economic loss as a result. The second criterion is reliance - whether the claimant actually relied on the mis-statement in making a decision that led to economic loss. The third criterion is proximity - whether there is a sufficiently close relationship between the defendant and the claimant to justify imposing liability for the economic loss. 

The case of Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd [1964] AC 465 established the principle that a duty of care can exist in cases of negligent mis-statement that causes economic loss. In this case, a bank provided a financial reference for a customer, but it was found to be careless and contained errors. The customer's supplier relied on this reference and suffered economic loss as a result when the customer became insolvent. The House of Lords held that the bank owed a duty of care to the supplier, as the loss was reasonably foreseeable, the supplier had relied on the reference and there was sufficient proximity between the parties.

However, the case of Caparo Industries plc v Dickman [1990] 2 AC 605 demonstrated that reasonable foreseeability and reliance alone are not enough to establish a duty of care in these types of cases. In this case, investors relied on a company's misleading accounts and invested, suffering loss. The House of Lords ruled that there was no duty of care owed as there was insufficient proximity between the company providing the accounts and the investors. Mere foreseeability of financial loss and reliance were not enough. A duty of care only existed where the company had undertaken some responsibility to the investors, or their relationship was equivalent to contract.

The Australian case of Perre v Apand [1999] HCA 36 confirmed the importance of proximity in establishing a duty of care for economic loss resulting from negligent mis-statement. A director provided an inaccurate reference for a company secretary who then stole money from his new employer. The High Court ruled there was no duty of care owed to the new employer, as there was insufficient proximity between the referee and the recipient of the reference in these circumstances. While loss was foreseeable and the recipient had relied on the reference, proximity was lacking.

In summary, to establish a duty of care in cases of economic loss arising from negligent mis-statement, there must be reasonable foreseeability of loss from reliance on the statement, actual reliance by the claimant, and sufficient proximity between the parties to warrant liability. The cases discussed demonstrate that while foreseeability and reliance are relevant factors, the key determinant is usually whether the relationship between the parties is sufficiently close to justify imposing a duty of care. If not, potential recovery of damages may be denied, even where false information was provided and relied upon.
