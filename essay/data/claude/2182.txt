Surface tension refers to the elastic tendency of liquids which makes the exposed surface contract to the smallest area possible.  It occurs because molecules at the surface do not have neighboring molecules on all sides, so they form stronger bonds with each other to minimize the surface area. This creates an elastic "film" on the surface. 

The surface tension of a liquid can be measured using different methods. The Jaeger method involves measuring the maximum pressure inside a bubble just before it bursts. The pressure inside the bubble is measured using a manometer, and the radius of the bubble is measured using a cathetometer. The surface tension is then calculated using the Young-Laplace equation relating pressure difference and surface tension. The Cambridge method involves measuring the maximum mass that can be added to a wire ring before it detaches from the liquid surface. The surface tension is calculated by equating the vertical components of surface tension force and gravity.

Comparing the surface tension of different liquids, water has a moderately high surface tension of 72.8 millinewtons per meter at 20°C, while mercury has an even higher surface tension of 485 mN/m. Liquids with lower surface tension like ethanol (22.3 mN/m) are more easily spilled and spread. Surface tension depends strongly on temperature for most liquids—as temperature increases, surface tension decreases because the molecules have more internal energy and weaker intermolecular bonds.

The surface tensions of solids can also be measured using similar methods by first melting the solid to form a liquid phase. However, surface tensions of solids in the solid state can be very difficult to measure directly. Instead, they are often calculated theoretically using simulations. Surface tensions of solids, especially metals, are usually higher than those of liquids. For example, the surface tension of liquid indium is around 460 mN/m, while that of solid indium approaches 2000 mN/m.

During the experiments, several errors and discrepancies may be encountered. Errors in the radius or mass measurement will propagate to the final surface tension calculation. Atmospheric pressure and humidity may also affect the results. Impurities and surfactants present in the liquid can lower the surface tension and give erroneous values. Surface tension depends on how long ago the surface was created—newly created surfaces may take time to reach equilibrium.  These errors must be minimized through careful experimentation and calculation to obtain accurate surface tension values.

In summary, surface tension arises from the difference in intermolecular forces at the surface and interior of a liquid or solid. It can be measured experimentally using methods like the Jaeger and Cambridge techniques. Surface tension depends strongly on temperature and presence of impurities. Understanding surface tension is important for applications like fluid dynamics, adhesion, and coating flows.
