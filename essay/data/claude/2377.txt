The Mediterranean region has a long history of human habitation, ranging from visitation and occupation to full colonisation. Colonisation refers to the establishment of permanent agricultural settlements, with populations that remain over many generations. This stands in contrast to visitation, which refers to temporary use of an area, or occupation, which implies use of a space without major landscape modification.

The earliest colonisation of the Mediterranean islands began during the Neolithic period, starting around 8500 BCE. During this time, populations from Anatolia and the Levant began colonising Cyprus, Crete, and other Aegean islands. For example, archaeological evidence from Khirokitia on Cyprus shows a well-established Neolithic village by 6800 BCE, indicating colonisation. The site features round stone houses, storage pits, and burials, reflecting permanence. 

The Bronze Age saw the rise of powerful kingdoms in the Aegean, including the Minoan and Mycenaean civilisations on Crete and mainland Greece respectively. These groups further colonised nearby islands, building large palace complexes and trading networks. For example, Phylakopi on Milos was an important Aegean port town during this period, showing Minoan influence. However, many of these Bronze Age settlements were abandoned around 1100 BCE during a wider societal collapse.

Colonisation resumed during the first millennium BCE, led by the Phoenicians, Greeks and Romans. The Phoenicians established colonies across the central Mediterranean, including Motya on Sicily, reaching its peak from 700-500 BCE. Greek colonisation started around 750 BCE, focussing on the coasts of modern Turkey, Italy and Sicily. For example, the town of Paestum in Italy was founded by Greeks around 600 BCE. Major Roman colonisation occurred from 300 BCE, especially under Augustus. Roman colonies included Pollentia on Mallorca and Carthago Nova in Spain.

On Cyprus, the first colonists were Neolithic farmers from the Levant, arriving around 8500 BCE. They brought agricultural lifestyles unlike the transient hunter-gatherers before them. Over centuries, the population became increasingly settled, adapting architecturally from round huts to rectangular structures. Burial practices also became more elaborate. Copper metallurgy developed around 3900 BCE, and trade links with Syria and Egypt grew.

In summary, the colonisation of the Mediterranean islands differed from visitation and occupation due to the establishment of long-term agricultural settlements. Over time, more complex societies, trade networks and political systems developed on the islands. Key examples of colonisation sites include Khirokitia and Phylakopi. On Cyprus, colonisation was a gradual process that started in the Neolithic but intensified over centuries through trade, innovation and stronger regional connections. Overall, the Mediterranean provides a useful case study for differentiating forms of human habitation.
