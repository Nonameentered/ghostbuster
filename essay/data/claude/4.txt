There were several factors that led to a rise in mass unemployment in the 1980s and 1990s in many Western economies. First, there were macroeconomic factors, including economic recessions and banking crises that contributed to a decline in aggregate demand and led firms to cut costs by reducing employment. Second, there were structural factors, including a decline in manufacturing employment due to globalization and technological change, as well as a shift to a more service-based economy. These structural shifts disproportionately impacted certain groups like less educated workers and those in declining industries. 

In the 1980s, many major economies experienced recessions that caused a drop in demand and led companies to cut jobs to reduce costs. For example, the early 1980s recession in the US caused the unemployment rate to rise to nearly 10% in 1982. The UK experienced a severe recession and banking crisis, with unemployment rising to over 11% in the mid-1980s. These macroeconomic downturns had a widespread impact on employment across many sectors.

There were also major structural changes in the economy that contributed to job losses. There was a decline in manufacturing jobs in many Western countries due to globalization, as it became easier for companies to offshore production to lower-cost countries. Technological changes further reduced the need for human labor in some sectors. At the same time, employment growth was concentrated in service sector jobs. However, many of those losing manufacturing jobs lacked the skills or education to transition into growing service roles.

The groups most at risk from rising unemployment were less educated workers, those in declining industries like manufacturing, and youth. Less educated workers had more difficulty adapting to technological changes and transitioning into growing service roles. Workers in manufacturing faced job losses from globalization and automation without an easy path to new jobs. Youth unemployment was higher as new entrants struggled to find work during recessions and the structural shifts.  

In conclusion, macroeconomic recessions and financial crises combined with structural changes like globalization, technological shifts, and the decline of manufacturing employment led to a substantial rise in unemployment across many Western economies in the 1980s and 1990s. Less educated workers, those in declining industries, and youth were most vulnerable to these changes, suffering prolonged periods of joblessness and difficulty transitioning into new employment. Overall, this period saw major labor market disruptions that disproportionately impacted more vulnerable groups in the population.
