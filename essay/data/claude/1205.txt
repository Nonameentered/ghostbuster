The objectives of the project on car aerodynamics were to optimize the design of the vehicle to reduce drag and improve efficiency. This was done through the use of computational fluid dynamics or CFD software, which simulated the flow of air over and around the vehicle. The software allowed the team to test different design configurations and see the impact on drag in a virtual environment.

The first objective was to identify areas of high drag in the original design. The CFD simulations showed that the front grille, wheel wells, and tail of the vehicle created significant drag. The team then tested alternate designs for these components to reduce the drag. A more aerodynamic front grille, wheel covers, and a tapered rear were simulated and showed substantial reductions in drag. 

The second objective was to improve the flow of air over and around the rest of the vehicle. The team smoothed transitions between components, reduced protrusions, and optimized the slope of the windshield.  These changes allowed air to flow more smoothly over the vehicle. The CFD software estimated that the drag coefficient was reduced by over 25% with these modifications, which would translate to a 10-15% improvement in fuel efficiency at typical highway speeds.

The results of the simulations were encouraging but not fully conclusive. While CFD provides a good approximation of how air will flow over a vehicle, it does not perfectly capture the complex aerodynamics. The only way to conclusively measure the improvement would be through wind tunnel testing of a physical prototype. Some potential faults in the experiment include oversimplification of the vehicle geometry in the simulation and not accounting for all aspects of real-world driving conditions.

Improvements to the experiment would be to build and test a prototype to validate the CFD results. Additional CFD simulations could also be run to optimize other factors like lift and handling at high speeds. Simulating the vehicle traveling on a road with other vehicles would also produce more realistic results. Overall though, the project objectives were achieved by using CFD to guide an iterative design process that significantly improved the aerodynamic efficiency of the vehicle. With some physical validation, the redesigned vehicle could achieve substantial fuel savings and emissions reductions compared to the original model.
