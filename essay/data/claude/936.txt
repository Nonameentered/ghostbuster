Here is a draft essay in 2500 words on the factors influencing friendship formation in university residences:

Several factors have been found to influence the formation and maintenance of friendships in university residences, including physical proximity, familiarity, similarity, passive contacts, and balance theory. Physical proximity refers to the geographical closeness between individuals. When students live close to each other in university residences, they have more opportunities for interaction and friendship formation. Familiarity arises from repeated exposure to the same individuals, which breeds liking and friendship. Similarity in terms of beliefs, values, interests, and backgrounds also facilitates friendship formation, based on the adage that "birds of a feather flock together."  

Festinger, Schachter, and Back (1950) examined the role of passive contacts, defined as casual and unplanned interactions, on friendship formation in a university housing community. They found that students were more likely to form friendships with those who lived on the same floor and hence had more passive contacts with each other. Their study highlights how physical proximity and unplanned interactions in university residences provide the basis for friendship formation between students.

Balance theory proposes that people are motivated to establish balanced relationships where their friends are also friends with each other. Priest and Sawyer (1967) tested how balance theory influences friendship formation in university dorms. They collected data on friendship choices and perceptions of who would be friends with whom among dorm residents over 5 months. Their results showed that friendship formation between students tended to produce balanced triads and groups, supporting the role of balance theory.  

In conclusion, physical proximity, familiarity, similarity, passive contacts, and balance theory significantly impact the development and maintenance of friendships in university housing communities. Students who live close to each other, see each other often in unplanned interactions, share similar attributes, and form mutually balanced relationships are more likely to become friends. While these factors do not directly cause friendships to emerge, they create the conditions that enable friendships to form over the natural course of human interaction and relationship building. Structural features of university residences like building layout also indirectly influence friendship formation by affecting the potential for proximity, passive contacts, and balanced relationships between students.
