Companies that market and sell baby formula should be evaluated based on several important criteria to ensure high ethical standards and consumer trust in the industry. There are good arguments  for national governments, non-governmental organizations, and market forces each influencing ethical guidelines in the baby formula industry. Overall, a collaborative approach with input from all three is most likely to lead to comprehensive ethical standards.

National governments are well-positioned to set guidelines and regulations for the ethical marketing and sale of baby formula in order to protect public health. Governments can enact laws and policies that prohibit unethical practices, such as restricting aggressive or misleading marketing. For example, in the 1970s Nestle was criticized for unethical marketing of formula in developing countries, leading to boycotts and eventually new laws regulating formula marketing. Governments can also set safety and nutrition standards, require truth in advertising, and mandate transparency about ingredients and health effects. However, governments may face political and corporate pressure and lobbying, and some argue regulations can be an inefficient approach.

Non-governmental organizations are also able to influence ethical standards in the baby formula industry without some of the shortcomings of government regulation. NGOs can draw public attention to unethical practices through advocacy campaigns and galvanize consumer pressure for change. For example, advocacy efforts in the 1970s highlighted Nestle's harmful practices and spurred the company to revise its marketing approach. NGOs are also able to set voluntary codes of conduct and certification standards for ethical practices that companies can adopt. However, NGOs lack the authority to enact binding laws and regulations, relying mostly on moral suasion and public pressure which companies can choose to ignore.  

Finally, consumer choice and market forces are argued by some to be the most effective mechanism for enforcing ethical standards in the baby formula industry. According to this view, companies will adopt ethical practices in order to appeal to consumers and gain market share. For example, Nestle ultimately revised its baby formula marketing in part due to the boycott of its products. However, this approach assumes that consumers have perfect information and ethical values in their purchasing choices, and that they will necessarily punish unethical companies. In reality, consumer actions are imperfect, and it can take time for information about unethical practices to come to light and influence the market.

In summary, national governments, non-governmental organizations, and informed consumer choice all have a role to play in setting ethical guidelines for the marketing and sale of baby formula. An approach that incorporates regulation, voluntary standards, advocacy, and market influence is most likely to ensure high ethical practices that support public health. Companies like Nestle should work constructively with governments and NGOs to meet ethical guidelines and regain consumer trust when it has been lost due to harmful actions. By following ethical standards set through a cooperative and multi-stakeholder process, companies can operate with integrity and responsibility.
