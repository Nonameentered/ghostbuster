John Locke proposed a representational model of perception in which our senses convey mental representations of physical objects to the mind. According to Locke, our senses are caused to produce ideas that resemble and represent qualities of external objects, like shape, size, color, sound, smell, taste, and texture. These ideas provide the mind with a grasp of an object's qualities, allowing us to form beliefs and make inferences about the external world. In his primary and secondary quality distinction, Locke argued that some qualities, like extension, figure, and motion resemble and represent real properties of objects, while other qualities like color and sound represent the effects external objects have on our senses. 

George Berkeley objected to Locke's model of perception and his arguments for believing in mind-independent physical objects. First, Berkeley argued that Locke's resemblance thesis is incoherent. Our ideas of external objects share no spatial or temporal properties with the objects they are meant to represent. An idea of a foot-long table has no length itself; it exists wholly in the mind. Without any shared properties between ideas and physical objects, Berkeley argued there is no meaningful sense in which an idea resembles or represents an external object.

Second, Berkeley challenged Locke's justification for belief in mind-independent objects. Locke argued that the orderly and consistent coherence of our perceptions justifies believing they represent a single external reality. But Berkeley countered that all we perceive are our own ideas, and there is no need to posit mind-independent objects to explain coherent perceptions. Our perceptions could cohere simply because they are associatively linked in the imagination by custom and habit. Berkeley argued we have no direct grasp of any material substance underlying our perceptions, so we cannot be justified in believing in the existence of physical objects outside our minds.

In my view, Berkeley raises compelling objections to Locke's arguments, but his own immaterialism is an overreaction. While ideas certainly share no direct resemblance to physical objects, they are systematically caused by objects through lawful natural relations, providing an indirect form of representation. And the coherence of perceptions alone may not prove physical objects exist, but it at least suggests our perceptions track a world with stable causal structures - whether physical or immaterial. An alternative model might treat perception as systematically caused symbolic representation: ideas represent objects in a law-governed way without resembling or sharing properties with them. This provides some justification for belief in an external reality without requiring direct resemblance. Overall, while Berkeley offers a thought-provoking critique, perception as natural symbolic representation provides a promising alternative account of our access to the external world.
