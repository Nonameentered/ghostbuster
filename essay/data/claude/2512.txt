There were several main approaches used by archaeologists and historians to interpret the megalithic culture that emerged in Europe during the Neolithic period, starting around 5000 years ago. These interpretive frameworks emphasized different aspects of the archaeological record and megalithic monuments, leading to varying conclusions about the origins and purposes of these prehistoric stone structures. 

One early approach focused on diffusionism and cultural influence from outside Europe. Archaeologists proposed that megalithic tombs and monumental architecture originated in Egypt or the Near East and then diffused into Europe, which lacked a tradition of stonemasonry. However, this approach ignored clear evidence that megalithic tombs evolved locally in Europe from earlier monument types like passage graves and long barrows. It also failed to explain regional variations in megalithic architecture across Europe.

A second approach, cultural-historical archaeology, aimed to classify megalithic monuments into distinct cultures based on architectural styles. For example, Colin Renfrew classified monuments into “cottage loaf” wedge-shaped galleries, “Severn-Cotswold” portal dolmens, and “court cairns” to define regional groups. However, this approach often projected modern cultural concepts onto prehistoric populations and overlooked evidence for connections across regions. It also provided little insight into the beliefs or social dynamics within these supposed “cultures.”

Processual archaeology, which emerged in the 1960s, took a more scientific approach. Archaeologists like Christopher Hawkes proposed functionalist interpretations of megalithic tombs, viewing them as a technological solution for collective burial that spread due to practical reasons, not cultural diffusion. However, this approach failed to explain the monumentality and elaboration of many tombs, or their use in ritual long after their construction. It provided a limited materialist perspective on megalithic beliefs and spirituality.

Post-processual approaches, which developed in the 1980s, aimed to understand megalithic tombs within the broader symbolic and ritual lives of prehistoric populations. Archaeologists focused on interpretations of monumentality, sacred landscapes, ritualized monument use, and cosmological symbolism. For example, Aubrey Burl proposed that passage tombs represented womb-like symbols of an afterlife, while Richard Bradley suggested tombs anchored ancestral claims to land. However, some post-processual interpretations were criticized as being overly speculative, lacking sufficient evidence from archaeological data.

To understand the shared beliefs within the megalithic population, we can examine regional case studies, which provide more nuanced evidence of megalithic practices and symbolic meaning. For example, in the Boyne Valley of Ireland, rich assemblages of artifacts, engravings, and alignments found within passage tombs like Newgrange indicate they were highly symbolic ritual monuments, aligned with the sun and possibly used in ancestor veneration or solstice celebrations. 

In Portugal’s Alentejo region, dolmens like Anta Grande do Zambujeiro featured central chamber areas where human remains were manipulated and interred with artifacts over hundreds of years, suggesting they were focal points for ritual activity and community gatherings long after their construction. Megalithic art found within some Iberian dolmens also provides symbolic meaning, such as images of axes, spirals, and anthropomorphic figures.

In southern Britain, sites like Avebury and Stonehenge demonstrate how megalithic monuments anchored sacred landscapes, which people returned to over generations to construct new features like the trilithons and Sarsen Circle at Stonehenge. These landscapes likely had symbolic meanings connected to prehistoric cosmologies, as well as serving as arenas for ritual gatherings and seasonal celebrations.

The spread of agriculture and migration during the Neolithic allowed for the spread of ideas across the European landscape. As groups moved into new areas, they brought with them knowledge of megalithic monument construction and their associated beliefs and cosmologies. When they encountered other groups, this could have led to a fusion of architectural styles, artistic motifs, and symbolic meanings, which we see evidenced in megalithic tombs. The tombs themselves, used for ritual activity across lifetimes and generations, anchored these shared ideas within communities and allowed for their transmission over time.

In conclusion, interpreting megalithic culture requires an approach that incorporates various lines of evidence—from architecture to artifacts, art, landscapes, and construction. While early theories often relied on diffusionist or overly simplistic explanations, a multi-perspective approach that examines how megalithic monuments functioned within broader symbolic and ritual spheres provides the most nuanced understanding of the shared beliefs that shaped megalithic societies in Neolithic Europe.
