Simple Life Ltd is a startup company focused on providing simple solutions for common hand ailments like carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, and tendinitis. Our mission is to help hand pain sufferers find relief through simple remedies and lifestyle changes, rather than expensive surgeries or medication with potential side effects. 

Over the next three years, Simple Life Ltd aims to capture a share of the growing hand ailment treatment market in two ways: by building an online community and resource for hand pain education and support, and by offering simple remedy products for alleviating symptoms.

For our online community, we will launch a website and build a social media following focused on hand health education and connecting those with hand pain. The website will offer free resources on common hand ailments, symptoms, lifestyle changes, exercises, and remedies to try at home. We will build SEO and attract organic traffic through our expertise and reputation in this niche. After six months, we aim to have over 50,000 monthly visitors and 10,000 email subscribers. We will then introduce a premium monthly membership to access additional resources, video tutorials, and an online community forum. With a target conversion rate of 5%, we project over 2,500 paying members after the first two years at $10/month, generating $300,000 in annual recurring revenue.  

For our remedy products, we will develop an all-natural line of lotions, balms, wraps, braces, and exercise tools aimed at relieving symptoms like pain, inflammation, stiffness, and weakness.  We will start with an anti-inflammatory turmeric lotion and a wrist brace for carpal tunnel, selling primarily through our own ecommerce site as well as through pharmacies and natural health retailers. In the first year, we aim to generate $500,000 in product sales at an average profit margin of 60% or $300,000. In years two and three, we will add additional products to our line, projected to increase total product sales to $2M and $5M respectively with similar profit margins.

With a growing population and increased technology use, the number of people suffering from debilitating hand pain is on the rise. Simple Life Ltd is poised to capture this opportunity by providing natural solutions focused on remedies and lifestyle changes as an alternative to expensive surgeries and drugs. By building an online education and community platform along with a line of supportive remedy products, Simple Life Ltd aims to generate over $1M in revenue and $500,000 in profits within the first three years of operation.
