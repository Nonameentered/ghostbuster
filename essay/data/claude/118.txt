The major objectives of studying a three-phase induction motor in the laboratory were to understand its key characteristics and performance attributes. This was achieved through connecting the motor to a dynamometer, which allows for controlling and measuring its speed and torque, and using a tachometer to precisely measure rotational velocity. By varying the load on the dynamometer, the torque-speed relationship of the motor could be determined. Measuring the current and voltage supplied to the motor also allowed for calculating parameters like power factor, power, and efficiency.

The torque-speed curve illustrates the key performance characteristics of the motor. At low speeds when the load is high, the torque is also high, as the motor works to overcome the load and accelerate. As the speed increases, the torque drops in accordance with the load, until the no-load speed is reached. This shows the maximum speed the motor can reach on its own. The power curve, calculated from torque and speed, shows how the mechanical power output increases with speed up to the no-load speed. 

The current, voltage, and power factor were also measured at different loads and speeds. The current decreases with speed as the motor requires less torque, and so less electrical power, to overcome the load. The power factor, or ratio of real power to apparent power, also increases with speed. A higher power factor means the motor is running more efficiently.

By calculating the input and output power at different loads, the efficiency of the motor at converting electrical power to mechanical power could also be determined. The efficiency is highest near the rated load of the motor, as this is the operating point it was designed for. At part loads or overload, the efficiency drops.

The laboratory experiment on the three-phase induction motor thus satisfied its objectives by providing a complete set of data on the motor's characteristics, illustrating through graphs the relationships between torque, speed, power, current, power factor, and efficiency. The results show how the motor operates at its peak performance at the rated load, but also provide a more comprehensive view of its attributes at less-than-ideal operating conditions. Measuring these key parameters is essential to understanding how three-phase induction motors actually work.
