Neanderthals evolved in Europe and Western Asia during the Ice Age, inhabiting environments that were significantly colder than today. Many features of their anatomy are thought to be adaptations to these cold climates. For example, Neanderthals had a stockier, more robust build with shorter limbs compared to modern humans. This body type helps retain heat and is more suited to cold weather. Their broad noses, large jaws, and barrel-shaped chests also suggested an adaptation to cold as they help warm and humidify the air that is breathed in.

Oxygen isotope analysis allows scientists to infer details about past climates and environments. Studies of oxygen isotopes in Neanderthal remains indicate they lived in predominantly cold environments, often glacial or periglacial. During glacial periods, average temperatures in Europe were 10-15°C colder than today. The cold, harsh conditions Neanderthals adapted to likely drove aspects of their anatomy and physiology.

In addition to their stocky builds, Neanderthals exhibited other physiological and skeletal adaptations to the cold. They had larger brains than earlier hominins, which helped enable complex tool use and the ability to construct shelters. Their broad chests and nostrils indicate large lung volumes and respiratory turbinates to condition inhaled air. Short, powerful limbs were useful for generating body heat through physical activity in cold weather. Neanderthals may also have had hairy bodies and possibly pale skin to protect from cold, though direct evidence for this is lacking.

In sum, a significant portion of the Neanderthal anatomy represented adaptations to cold environments, based on analyses of their habitats, physiology, and climate reconstructions. Their stocky and robust build, large nasal passages and chests, and short limbs allowed for heat retention, conditioning of inhaled air, and physical activity suited to cold weather survival. While other factors also influenced their evolution, living through glacial periods in Europe required anatomical adaptations to cope with the cold—adaptations that are evident in the Neanderthal form. Overall, Neanderthals were well suited to the demanding environments they inhabited.
