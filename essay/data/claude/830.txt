Here is a 1000-word essay in response to the prompt:

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by inflammation and ulcers of the colon and rectum. The diagnostic criteria for UC include a combination of clinical symptoms, endoscopic findings, histological features, and radiological findings. Clinically, patients may present with abdominal pain, diarrhea, urgency, tenesmus, and hematochezia. Endoscopically, continuous mucosal inflammation starting from the rectum and extending proximally is observed. Histologically, crypt abscesses, depletion of goblet cells, and inflammatory infiltrates in the mucosa are seen. CT or MRI may show wall thickening and edema of the colon. 

The management options for UC include aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biologics, and surgery. Aminosalicylates like mesalazine are usually used for mild to moderate disease. Oral or IV corticosteroids are used for moderate to severe disease to induce remission. Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine are steroid-sparing immunosuppressants used to maintain remission. Infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and vedolizumab are biologics that can be used in moderate to severe UC, especially in steroid-dependent or refractory cases. Colectomy may be recommended in cases of severe UC not responding to medical therapy, dysplasia or colon cancer, perforation, or uncontrolled bleeding.

Several risk factors have been associated with UC. Genetics plays a role, as UC is more common in first-degree relatives. Environmental factors include smoking, appendectomy early in life, diet high in sugar and fat but low in fiber, and microbiome alterations. UC usually presents between the ages of 15 to 35, so age is also a risk factor. Psychological stress may exacerbate symptoms in patients with UC.   

In a 79-year-old patient with weight loss, PR bleeding, and altered bowel habits, the differential diagnoses to consider include UC, Crohn's colitis, infectious colitis, ischemic colitis, diverticular bleeding, and colon cancer. Colonoscopy with biopsies is needed to confirm the diagnosis. UC at this age may have an atypical presentation and more complications. The physician must have a high index of suspicion to diagnose UC in the elderly.

All patients with long-standing UC need regular surveillance for colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonoscopy with biopsies is recommended 8-10 years after the onset of symptoms to screen for CRC and dysplasia. If no dysplasia is detected, follow up colonoscopies are done every 1-2 years. Chromoendoscopy and targeted biopsies can improve dysplasia detection during surveillance. Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis need annual surveillance due to higher CRC risk.  Patients diagnosed with CRC should undergo appropriate treatment based on disease stage.

In summary, UC should be suspected in patients with the characteristic clinical, endoscopic and histological features. Early diagnosis and treatment are key to induce and maintain remission, improving prognosis and quality of life. Close surveillance is vital for early detection of CRC in these high-risk patients.
