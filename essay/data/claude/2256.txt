There are two main methods used in C++ for implementing blocks-world management in AI: depth-first search and breadth-first search. These search algorithms are applied in a practical AI planning project with blocks to find a sequence of actions that transform an initial state into a goal state.

The depth-first search explores paths in a block tree as far as possible before retreating. It uses a last-in, first-out stack data structure.  This method has the advantage of potentially finding a solution quickly. However, it may get stuck in infinite loops and never reach the goal. The breadth-first search explores all neighbor nodes at the current depth before moving on to the next level. It uses a first-in, first-out queue data structure. This method is slower but guarantees the shortest path to the goal will be found.

Some challenges in combining these search methods into a blocks world program are ensuring the algorithms accurately represent the block interactions and constraints to find a viable solution, handling the combinatorial explosion of possibilities as the number of blocks increases, and optimizing the search for efficiency. The program must track block positions, adjacencies, stacking limits, and goals. As more blocks are added, the number of possible moves and sequences the algorithms must consider scales up dramatically. Optimizations like pruning impossible or unhelpful branches of the search tree can improve performance.

In summary, depth-first search and breadth-first search are two foundational AI techniques used to solve planning problems in a blocks world. With the application of additional AI concepts like heuristics and optimizations, these search methods can be adapted to solve larger and more complex block arrangement challenges. However, issues like combinatorial explosion must be addressed to scale up to more realistic block planning problems.
