Prehistoric humans had a significant impact on the development of British soils and the formation of the soils we see today in the British landscape. As hunter-gatherers, prehistoric humans may have inadvertently affected soils by influencing vegetation patterns through burning, tree clearing, and seed dispersal. However, more substantial impacts arose with the advent of farming in the Neolithic period around 4000 BCE.

Early farming practices, such as slash-and-burn techniques to clear land, would have exposed soils and increased erosion rates. The planting of crops like wheat and barley and the grazing of livestock concentrated nutrients in some areas of the landscape while depleting them in others. Over many centuries, these practices fundamentally altered soil profiles and chemistry across much of Britain.

Farming also accelerated the rate of soil carbon loss through oxidation and erosion. Estimates suggest soil carbon levels declined by up to 50-70% in some areas following the transition to agriculture. This carbon loss had wider implications, as declining soil carbon reduces soil fertility, water retention, and stability. Many soils took centuries or millennia to recover carbon lost during initial agricultural expansion.

Some of the most dramatic impacts were in southcentral and southeast England, where nearly all native forest cover was cleared for agriculture over several centuries. Soil erosion rates were up to 100 times higher than they had been, contributing to substantial soil loss and deterioration. Many soils in areas of intensive agriculture were depleted of nutrients and organic matter, becoming compacted, acidic, and poorly structured.

However, farming also contributed to soil improvement and formation in some locations. The continuous application of manure, compost, and crop residues over many generations enriched the soil, increased its fertility, and improved its ability to support agriculture. In some places, entirely new soils known as "anthrosols" formed from the residues and waste products of human activity. These soils continue to support productive agriculture today.

In conclusion, while prehistoric hunter-gatherers may have slightly altered British soils, the rise of agriculture in the Neolithic period drove the most significant impacts. Early farming practices caused widespread soil erosion, carbon and nutrient loss, and deteriorationâ€”but over time also created fertile, agriculturally productive soils. This complex history has shaped the diversity of soils found across Britain today.  The activities of prehistoric man were instrumental in the formation of modern British soils.
