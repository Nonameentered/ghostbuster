Healthcare professionals face significant challenges when a terminally ill patient refuses treatment and admission to the hospital. As the primary care provider, the patient's general practitioner has the responsibility to continue providing care and monitoring the patient's condition, despite the refusal of treatment. The GP must balance the patient's wishes with their duty to relieve suffering and provide comfort. Other healthcare workers like nurses, palliative care specialists, and social workers also play a role in ensuring the patient's basic needs are met and helping to coordinate end-of-life care.

When a patient refuses hospital admission and curative treatment, their condition will typically continue to deteriorate due to the progression of the disease. The patient will experience increasing symptoms like pain, nausea, fatigue, and difficulty breathing. The GP and other healthcare professionals must work to manage these symptoms and keep the patient as comfortable as possible, even without the aggressive interventions of hospital care. They may prescribe medications for pain and nausea, recommend dietary changes, oxygen therapy or other treatments that can be provided at home. 

The patient's refusal of treatment can introduce complications in family dynamics and relationships. Family members may disagree with the patient's choice and want them to pursue more aggressive options. They may feel distressed watching their loved one's condition decline at home. The healthcare team can provide counseling and support for family members to help them come to terms with the patient's wishes and prepare for the end stages of life. Coordinating with home health aides and hospice volunteers, they work to maintain the patient's quality of life and allow them to remain comfortably and peacefully at home as desired.

While the challenges are significant, when healthcare professionals respect a terminally ill patient's refusal of treatment and hospitalization, they can still provide a high level of comfort and dignity. By managing symptoms, providing social and emotional support, and helping coordinate end-of-life care at home, doctors, nurses and others allow these patients to live out their final days on their own terms, surrounded by loved ones, and with the best quality of life possible under the circumstances. Overall, the patient's wishes must be honored, even when continuing to refuse medical intervention. Healthcare professionals must adapt to provide care that aligns with those wishes.
