Here is a draft 2000-word essay in response to the prompt:

The 'tip of the tongue' (TOT) experience is a common phenomenon where we have a strong feeling that we know a word or name, but cannot quite retrieve it from memory at that moment. The TOT experience provides insight into how our brain organizes and retrieves words and names, as well as the processes involved in speech production. 

When we have a TOT experience, we are usually able to recall some partial information about the word, like the first letter or number of syllables. This indicates that our lexical knowledge is organized by certain attributes like initial phonemes, syllables, and word length. However, the full phonological representation of the word remains tantalizingly out of reach for the moment. The TOT state suggests that word retrieval is a multi-step process, where we can access some partial features of a word before retrieving its complete phonological form.

The TOT experience also reveals that speech production relies not just on accessing the phonological representation of a word, but also its semantic features and associations. We tend to have more TOT experiences for proper names compared to common words. This is because proper names have weaker semantic associations, even though their phonological representations may be equally familiar. The weaker semantic connections make the names harder to retrieve. TOT incidents point to the importance of semantic knowledge and associations in supporting fluent speech production.

Furthermore, TOT experiences suggest that phonological representations in the brain may be activated below the threshold of consciousness. There is a 'feeling of knowing' the word that has not yet bubbled up to actual articulation. Contemporary theories of speech production propose that word retrieval involves the accumulation of activation in a network of connected representations, until a threshold is reached that permits utterance. The TOT state appears to capture this transitional process in action.

In summary, the TOT experience provides a window into the architecture and mechanisms underlying speech production. It reveals how the phonological, semantic and associative attributes of words are organized in the brain, and how they interact to facilitate word retrieval and utterance. The TOT state shows language in motion, as activation builds up and flows between interconnected representations. By gaining insight into normal and impaired word finding, the TOT experience has much to teach us about the wonder of human language.
