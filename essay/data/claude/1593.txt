Violence plays a central role in contemporary Latin American cinema. Directors frequently depict graphic scenes of violence and bloodshed, not for sensational effect, but to provide social commentary and insights into the societies and characters they are portraying. By examining three acclaimed recent films from Latin America—Elite Squad (Brazil, 2007), Miss Bala (Mexico, 2011), and No (Chile, 2012)—we can see how violence functions as a storytelling device and mechanism for exploring societal issues.

In Elite Squad, director José Padilha uses violence to examine police corruption and brutality in Rio de Janeiro. The film is filled with scenes of graphic violence as BOPE, the elite police squad, employs brutal tactics to impose order in the city's favelas. The violence is highly unsettling, yet crucial to understanding the social problems the film examines, e.g. the cyclical nature of violence in marginalized communities. The violence also shapes the protagonists, hardening and dehumanizing the police even as they fight for justice. By confronting the audience with the harsh realities of violence, the film serves a didactic purpose in calling for reform.   

Miss Bala uses violence in a different way to critique the Mexican government's "war on drugs." Director Gerardo Naranjo focuses on Laura, a woman caught in a cycle of violence as she witnesses assassinations, is subjected to abuse and threats, and is forced into acting as a drug mule. The violence is not sensationalized; instead it's a sinister, suffocating force that dominates Laura's life. By seeing Laura's helplessness in the face of violence, we understand how violence traps people and gives criminals power over society. The film suggests Mexico's anti-cartel policies have only exacerbated violence by removing protection for citizens. 

In No, director Pablo Larraín employs archival footage of political violence under Pinochet to provide historical context for the film's story. While less overtly violent than the other films, it looms as a threat if the pro-democracy activists fail. The film uses the past and the possibility of future violence to build tension, while advocating for non-violent action as the protagonists work to end Pinochet's regime through a referendum campaign. By incorporating real footage of violence, the film authenticates its message about how Chile transitioned to democracy peacefully. 

In summary, violence is a common storytelling technique in contemporary Latin American cinema used to explore societal problems, convey insights into characters, and serve a didactic purpose. The three films discussed employ violence and the threat of violence in different ways to provide commentary on issues from police corruption to the failures of anti-cartel policies to the importance of non-violent action for change. Through unflinching depictions of violence, these films expose the darker realities of life in Latin America and invite analysis of what has shaped these realities.
