The Neolithic monuments at Avebury in Wiltshire, England are some of the largest and most impressive prehistoric sites in Britain. Established between 3500 and 2500 BCE, the complex in Avebury includes a stone circle, avenues of standing stones, stone enclosures, and man-made earthen mounds. These massive and elaborate structures have fascinated archaeologists and scholars for centuries, who have posited various theories as to the function and use of Avebury and produced evidence to support these theories.

One prominent theory is that Avebury was a ceremonial or ritual site. The massive scale and precise architecture required to build such complex monuments suggests they served some cultural or religious purpose beyond merely agricultural or pragmatic use. The structure and alignments of the Avebury monuments suggest they were designed to facilitate processions and gatherings. The Kennet Avenue connects the Avebury stone circles and the Sanctuary in an almost straight line, and the West Kennet Avenue creates several direct sightlines, suggesting ceremonial walks or pilgrimages between the sites. The circular shape of the monuments is also conducive to facilitating large groups of people. Some archaeologists argue the monuments created a theatrical landscape for ritual performance, dancing, chanting, or other ceremonial activities.

Secondly, Avebury has been interpreted as a site of mortuary and ancestor rituals by some archaeologists. Human remains, including skull fragments, have been found at Avebury, and burials have been uncovered nearby at Windmill Hill, indicating the area was used for mortuary purposes around the same time Avebury was constructed. The massive scale of the Avebury monuments would be suitable for large gatherings to conduct burial rites and honor ancestors. The round barrows surrounding Avebury are also indicative of a mortuary complex. However, burials within the ditch and below the standing stones are few. So, while mortuary rituals may have taken place at Avebury, they do not seem to be the central or sole use of the site.

Thirdly, Avebury has been interpreted as a site of seasonal gatherings that kept track of the solar calendar. The alignment of the Avebury monuments suggests they were designed to track solstices and equinoxes, marking important dates for agriculture. The southern inner circle at Avebury is aligned with the summer solstice sunrise, and the Kennet Avenue points directly east-west. Marking the solar calendar would have been critical for Neolithic peoples, and Avebury provided a symbolic and ceremonial center for this. However, while the alignments are convincing, the complexity and scale of Avebury suggests it likely served more religious or social purposes beyond just agricultural needs.

In conclusion, while there are multiple theories regarding the function and use of Avebury, the most compelling evidence supports the interpretation of Avebury as a primarily ceremonial and ritual site, albeit one that also incorporated mortuary and solar alignments that would have been culturally important for Neolithic peoples. The massive scale of construction, precise architecture, and processional avenues all point to Avebury as a place of cultural and religious gathering. Its role in mortuary and solar rituals stem from these cultural and religious purposes, demonstrating the centrality of such practices in Neolithic life. Overall, Avebury provides a glimpse into the symbolic world of prehistoric Britain's first farmers.
