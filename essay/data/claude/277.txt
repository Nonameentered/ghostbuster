The doctrine of judicial review allows courts to examine the decisions and actions of public bodies and lower courts to determine whether they are lawful and consistent with established principles. Where decisions are found to violate individual rights or established legal principles, courts can issue orders to remedy the situation. This essay will explore the principles of judicial review in the context of two scenarios involving decisions made by ABC College, a fictional higher education institution.

In the first scenario, ABC College has decided to implement a mandatory vaccination policy for all students and staff. While the goal of achieving high rates of vaccination for communicable diseases is laudable, the policy raises issues around informed consent and individual liberty. A decision to compel medical intervention without informed consent could be seen as a violation of common law principles and human rights. The policy could potentially be challenged on the grounds that it is beyond the legal authority of ABC College, is unreasonable or disproportionate, or violates principles of natural justice by not allowing for exceptions or proper consideration of individual circumstances. 

Under administrative law, public bodies like ABC College have implied but limited powers to make decisions that enable them to fulfill their functions. Requiring vaccination extends beyond the core functions of a college and could be seen as overreach. The decision could also be challenged as unreasonable if less restrictive options were available to achieve the same goal. The policy may also violate the proportionality principle by taking an extreme action not proportional to the risk.  

In terms of natural justice, the lack of any stated exceptions or process for individuals to request exemptions based on health conditions or personal beliefs suggests a lack of fairness in the decision-making process. The rules of natural justice would require ABC College to allow individuals affected by the decision to provide input before implementing such a policy. Failing to do so constitutes a breach of procedural fairness.

The second scenario involves ABC College's decision to rescind a master's program in statistics. Students still in the program would face difficulties finishing their degrees, and prospective students are now barred from entry. The decision raises issues around reasonable expectations, estoppel, and procedural fairness.

Students currently in the program could argue that they had a reasonable expectation that the program they enrolled in would be available for the duration of their studies. The concept of estoppel prevents parties from going back on representations that others have relied upon. ABC College should not be able to substantially alter the program of study midway through student progress. 

The decision to close the program also lacks procedural fairness as it does not appear students or staff were properly consulted. As the decision directly impacts their interests, the rules of natural justice would require ABC College to notify those affected and allow them an opportunity to voice concerns before the final decision. Failure to do so makes the process arbitrary and could be grounds for judicial review.

In conclusion, judicial review allows administrative decisions to be examined against established legal principles. Scenarios involving mandatory vaccination policies and closure of academic programs raise issues related to jurisdiction, reasonableness, proportionality, procedural fairness and natural justice. Courts can issue remedies where a decision is found to violate common law principles, fundamental rights or the authority of the decision-making body. Overall, the availability of judicial review helps ensure that administrative decision makers exercise their authority responsibly and with appropriate oversight and accountability.
