Packaging materials serve several important functions in protecting and preserving foods. The main functions of packaging materials are containment, protection, communication, and convenience. In terms of containment, packaging materials provide a physical barrier between the external environment and the food product. This prevents contamination and leakage. In terms of protection, packaging protects foods from damage, spoilage, and pathogens. Protection against moisture, gases, light, and microbes is critical for food preservation. 

The permeability of packaging materials determines which types of microorganisms can grow within the package. Packaging that is impermeable to oxygen, like metal cans and glass jars, prevents the growth of aerobic microorganisms but allows anaerobic microbes like Clostridium botulinum to thrive. Packaging permeable to carbon dioxide but not oxygen, like many plastics, prevents growth of aerobic microbes but not facultative anaerobes. Packaging permeable to moisture allows for growth of spoilage microbes and pathogens that require high moisture, like molds. Impermeable packaging is best for retaining moisture and preventing microbial growth.

Common food packaging materials include plastics (e.g. polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene (PP)), glass, paper, paperboard, and metals (e.g. aluminum, tinplate). Plastics are lightweight, inexpensive, and can be manufactured in various permeabilities. However, plastics often lack strength and barrier properties. Glass is impermeable but breakable and heavy. Paper and paperboard are renewable and recyclable but lack moisture and gas barrier. Metals have excellent barrier properties but are more expensive and lack transparency.

The mechanical strength of packaging materials impacts their ability to protect foods. Stronger materials can withstand pressure changes, impacts from dropping or compression, and puncture forces better than weaker materials. For example, glass containers provide an excellent oxygen barrier but often break under stress, compromising the package integrity. Metal cans are very sturdy but also lack transparency. Flexible plastics and paper provide minimal structural support. The ideal packaging has sufficient strength to withstand stresses induced during manufacturing, distribution, and use while also providing adequate barrier properties.

In summary, the functions and properties of packaging materials significantly impact food quality and safety. Ideal packaging achieves the right balance of containment, protection, communication, convenience, permeability, and mechanical strength for a given food product. Advancements in packaging continue to enable longer shelf lives and more convenient food options for consumers. Overall, proper packaging design is essential for food preservation and protection.
