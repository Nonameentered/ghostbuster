Here is a draft 2250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Fast mapping and quick incidental learning are processes by which young children rapidly acquire new words from brief contextual exposures. These learning mechanisms challenge the traditional belief that word learning in infants and toddlers requires repeated and explicit instruction or labeling. 

Fast mapping refers to the ability of children to quickly form rough hypotheses about the meaning of a new word after a single contextual exposure. In a seminal study, Carey and Bartlett (1978) exposed 3- to 4-year-old children to a made-up word 'chromium' in a single sentence, e.g. 'The chromium fell out of the car.' When later shown pictures of novel objects, children systematically selected the unfamiliar object that fit the semantic constraints of the sentence, e.g. they chose an odd-shaped piece of metal. This demonstrated children's ability to infer an initial meaning hypothesis for an unknown word, even from very sparse input.

Research on quick incidental learning shows that preschool children can acquire new words rapidly in naturalistic contexts when the words are embedded in meaningful speech, even without explicit labeling or instruction. Childers and Tomasello (2002) asked parents to simply read picture books to their 2- and 3-year-old children as normal. Some of the books contained unfamiliar words, e.g. 'apiary' or 'tendril'. After just two readings, most children had learned the meaning of the new words, as evidenced in their explanations and ability to point out examples. This learning occurred very quickly and with no direct labeling of the new words.   

These word learning mechanisms contradict the view that young children require highly supportive contexts with repetition and feedback to learn new words. While such ideal conditions may optimize learning, fast mapping and quick incidental learning show that new words can be acquired from quite sparse input. However, these rapid learning processes are constrained by the child's existing semantic knowledge. The inferred meaning of a new word will be consistent with the core meanings the child already knows. For instance, Carey and Bartlett found that 'chromium' was not mapped to unrelated concepts like 'banana' or 'elephant'.  

Internal constraints on children's hypotheses also include preferences for whole objects, animate things, or taxa like 'animal' or 'vehicle' (Markman, 1991).  In a study by Woodward et al. (1994), 2-year-olds who heard a new word in a sentence while viewing unfamiliar objects and animals, e.g. 'Look at the blicket!', systematically chose as the referent of 'blicket' an entire animate object, rather than parts, substances or inanimate things. This shows how children's expectations about word meaning shape their initial guesses about word reference.

In conclusion, fast mapping and quick incidental learning demonstrate how rapidly and efficiently young children can infer the meaning of new words from minimal exposure. These learning mechanisms rely on the child's existing semantic knowledge to constrain the hypotheses that are formed about word meaning. The findings challenge the traditional view that preschool word learning requires highly supportive instructional contexts. With the innate ability to draw on contextual cues and internal constraints, children are able to bootstrap their vocabulary at a remarkable speed.
