Essay Prompt: Discuss your business plan for an e-commerce company 
that will sell energy-efficient lightbulbs. Include the company's customer service strategy, plans to stand out from competitors, and proposed funding.

Energy-Efficient Lighting Co. will be an e-commerce retailer specializing in affordable, high-quality energy-efficient lightbulbs and lighting fixtures for residential and commercial customers. We will differentiate from competitors through superior customer service, a streamlined shopping experience, and partnerships with utility companies.

For customer service, we will provide 24/7 phone and chat support as well as how-to videos and blog posts on choosing and installing the right efficient lighting products. We will also offer free shipping on all orders within the contiguous U.S. and hassle-free returns within 30 days of delivery. 

To stand out from competitors, our website will make it easy to compare options across different bulb types (e.g. LED vs CFL) and find the most suitable, cost-effective product for each customer based on their needs and utility company incentives or rebates. We will establish partnerships with utilities to promote our products to their commercial and residential customers, with a share of revenues from sales generated through these partnerships going back to the utilities.

To fund operations, we are seeking $2 million in Series A funding from venture capital firms that focus on energy, sustainability, and home technology companies. The funding will be used to build and launch the initial e-commerce platform, market the company, and stock a range of products from major manufacturers to meet anticipated demand. Sales are projected to reach $10 million in the first three years, with a 20% profit margin and growing partnerships with utilities nationwide.

In summary, through a dedication to service, smart partnerships, and Series A funding, Energy-Efficient Lighting Co.will become a one-stop shop for affordable, eco-friendly lighting and an industry leader in driving the adoption of energy efficiency.
