Here is a 1750 word essay in response to the prompt:

The standard analysis of knowledge is that it consists of three necessary and jointly sufficient conditions: justification, truth, and belief. This is commonly referred to as the ‘JTB’ theory of knowledge. According to this theory, a person knows a proposition P if and only if:

1) P is true. The condition of truth is straightforward - for knowledge, a person must believe a proposition that is actually true. Believing in false things, no matter how justified the belief is, does not constitute knowledge.

2) The person believes P. The subject must believe in the proposition - knowledge requires a cognitive attitude. If a person does not actually believe in the proposition, they do not know it. Belief is a necessary prerequisite for knowledge. 

3) The person is justified in believing P. The belief must be justified or supported by evidence that gives us good reason to believe it is true. If a belief is merely a guess or intuition without any justification, it does not qualify as knowledge even if it turns out to be true. Justification is what makes the difference between a lucky guess and actual knowledge.

However, each of these conditions has been subjected to controversy and debate. The truth condition seems straightforward but there are propositions that appear true on the surface but are in fact false. Our senses and intuitions can deceive us, as in the case of optical illusions or cognitive biases. The belief condition requires that we have a particular mental state of belief - but there are debates around whether degrees of belief or implicit beliefs should count as knowledge. 

The justification condition is the most controversial and contested aspect of the JTB theory. There are debates around whether justification should be internal or external, what constitutes sufficient justification, how much justification is needed, and whether justification is relative or universal. Foundationalist theories argue that justification is based on a foundation of basic beliefs that do not require further justification. Coherentist theories argue that justification is based on how well a belief coheres with other things we believe. Externalist theories argue that factors outside of the mind like reliability or causation can determine justification. contextualist theories that hold that the standards of justification can vary based on context.

Due to these controversies, the standard tripartite theory of knowledge as JTB has been argued by many to be incomplete. Gettier cases, like in Edmund Gettier's 1963 paper, provide counterexamples to show that JTB is not sufficient for knowledge. In response, philosophers have proposed multiple revisions and additions to the theory to make it more complete, referred to as ‘post-Gettier epistemology’. For example, sensitivity conditions state that knowledge requires not just true belief but a belief that would not have been held if it were false. Reliabilism argues that justification depends on the reliability of the knowledge-forming process. Proper functionalism links knowledge to the proper functioning of cognitive faculties that have the purpose of producing true beliefs. These extended theories of knowledge aim to resolve the controversies with the standard JTB theory.

In summary, while the justified true belief theory provides a good initial framework for conceptualizing knowledge, deeper reflection on its three conditions reveals that it requires further revision and expansion to overcome its shortcomings. The extended theories proposed in response to Gettier's counterexamples have moved epistemology closer to a nuanced understanding of what constitutes knowledge.
