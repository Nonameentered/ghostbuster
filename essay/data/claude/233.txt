The two most influential models of oligopoly competition are the Bertrand model and Cournot model. The models differ in how firms assume their rivals will react to a firm's actions and price changes. Under the Bertrand model, firms assume that their rivals will match any price decrease but not match any price increase. Under the Cournot model, firms assume their rivals will not change output in response to a firm's output changes. 

The Bertrand model results in a higher intensity of competition than the Cournot model. In the Bertrand model, any firm charging even a slightly higher price than its rivals will lose all of its customers and make zero profits. Firms are engaged in a "price war" where they undercut each other's prices to try and gain a larger market share. This results in the equilibrium price settling at the perfectly competitive level, as if the industry were instead made up of many small firms. Profits are driven down to zero.

In contrast, the Cournot model results in a lower intensity of competition and positive long-run economic profit for firms. Each firm chooses its profit-maximizing output level taking the output levels of its rivals as given. This results in a supracompetitive output for the industry overall and a higher price than under perfect competition. Profits are lower than a monopoly but higher than perfect competition. 

The intensity of competition under each model depends on various factors like product differentiation, the degree of advertising, and differences in efficiency between firms. When products are more differentiated, the intensity of competition is lower under both models. Firms face a more inelastic demand for their unique products giving them more market power and ability to raise prices without losing many customers. Advertising also reduces intensity of competition by increasing product differentiation and customer loyalty.

When firms have different efficiencies, the more efficient firms earn higher profits under both models. However, competition is fiercer in the Bertrand model where inefficient firms may be forced to charge prices below marginal cost to match efficient rivals, suffering losses. In the Cournot model, higher-cost firms choose lower outputs and charge higher prices, limiting losses. Efficient firms are still able to gain higher market share and earn higher profits due to a cost advantage.

In conclusion, the Bertrand model of competition leads to a higher intensity of competition and lower profits than the Cournot model. Under the Bertrand model, any opportunity to lower prices is seized by rivals seeking to gain market share. The Cournot model results in less aggressive price competition but higher total outputs as firms choose outputs strategically based on their rivals' output levels. Various factors like product differentiation, advertising, and differences in efficiency can increase or decrease the intensity of competition under each model. Overall, the degree of competitiveness in an oligopoly depends critically on the mode of competition that predominates in the market.
