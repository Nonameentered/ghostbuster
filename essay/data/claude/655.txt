Here is a 765-word essay in response to the prompt:

Judges use several aids or rules of construction when interpreting statutes, including  plain meaning, legislative intent, coherence with broader legal frameworks, and precedential value. These rules seek to provide guidance for applying written law to new situations as objectively and consistently as possible. However, there are disagreements over which rule should take precedence and in recent years the debate over statutory interpretation has intensified.

The plain meaning rule holds that statutes should be interpreted according to the ordinary meaning of the language used. If the wording is unambiguous, judges should not look beyond the text itself. The advantage is that it provides stability and predictability in the law. However, language is often ambiguous and textual meaning depends heavily on context. Strict plain meaning interpretation can lead to absurd or unintended outcomes.

Legislative intent focuses on determining the purpose and goals behind a statute. Judges examine legislative records like committee reports to understand why a law was enacted. While intent can help clarify ambiguity, it is often difficult to determine a single intent among many legislators. Critics argue this approach gives too much discretion to judges and undermines the separation of powers.

Judges also consider how their interpretation will fit coherently within the broader legal framework of common law principles and other statutes. A coherent system of laws should have consistent principles and interpretations across domains. However, prioritizing coherence can lead to stretching the meaning of statutes beyond what was originally intended.  

Finally, the doctrine of stare decisis gives weight to precedential interpretations of statutes. Following precedent promotes stability and consistency in the law. But strict reliance on precedent can become rigid and prevent the law from adapting to changing circumstances. Judges must balance these competing rules of construction to reach a reasonable statutory interpretation.

A seminal case regarding the use of legislative debates is Pepper v Hart (1993) in the UK, where the House of Lords permitted reference to ministerial statements. This overturned an earlier rule prohibiting such reference in order to resolve ambiguity. Pepper v Hart represented a victory for legislative intent over plain meaning. However, it remains controversial, with concerns over relying on comments from a few ministers to determine the meaning of text approved by parliament as a whole.

In conclusion, judges apply a range of interpretive rules and the way these rules are balanced has important implications for the law. While recent decades have seen a shift toward more intentionalist approaches, there is no consensus on a single correct method of statutory interpretation. Debates over the appropriate use of legislative history and the hierarchy of interpretive rules will likely continue for the foreseeable future. Overall, the trend seems to be toward a more pragmatic and contextualized approach to interpretation.
