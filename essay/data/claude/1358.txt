Preterm birth, defined as birth before 37 weeks of gestation, can have significant effects on cognitive and motor development in infants and children. A longitudinal cohort study conducted by Batshaw, Telford, Rosett, and Moylan  examined the effects of preterm birth on development in a cohort of babies born in 1980 or 1981 to mothers residing in Merseyside county. The study followed up with the children at 1, 4, and 8 years of age to assess cognitive, motor, language, and behavioral development.

At 1 year of age, the study found that preterm infants scored significantly lower on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, especially on the mental development index. The average mental development index score for term infants was 103 while preterm infants born at 32-36 weeks and less than 32 weeks scored 96 and 89 respectively, indicating a 9 to 14 point deficit. These cognitive delays were present even when controlling for birth weight and social factors. At 4 years of age, the same cohort was re-assessed with the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities. Again, preterm children scored lower on verbal, quantitative, memory, and motor scales compared to term children, with the biggest delays seen in children born before 32 weeks. Similarly, at 8 years of age the WISC-R and Movement ABC tests were used, showing persistent deficits in verbal comprehension, perceptual organization, and motor skills in the preterm group.

While informative, this study has some limitations. The cohort only assessed Caucasian children in one county, limiting generalizability. Additionally, only about 50% of the original cohort remained in the study at 8 years, potentially biasing the results. However, the major strength of this study is its longitudinal design, allowing the same children to be followed over time to assess how premature birth impacts development from infancy through middle childhood.

In summary, this study provides evidence that preterm birth, especially very preterm birth before 32 weeks, poses risks for lower cognitive and motor abilities that persist from infancy into childhood. Interventions and social support systems are needed to promote optimal development in these high-risk children. With medical advancements improving the survival of extremely preterm infants, continued follow-up with this cohort into adolescence and beyond will be crucial to fully understand the effects of prematurity on growth and developmental outcomes.
