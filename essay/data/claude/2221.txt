Transcription is the first step of gene expression, which involves the biosynthesis of RNA from DNA template strands. Primary transcripts are the initial RNA transcripts that are not fully processed. These transcripts will experience various modifications and transformations into mature RNA molecules that differ from the original transcripts in size and functional capabilities.

The process of transcription begins in the nucleus where the DNA double helix is unwound by DNA helicases and transcription factors recognize DNA sequences, known as promoters and enhancers, to bind and initiate transcription. RNA polymerase then binds to the promoter sequence and begins to synthesize an RNA strand in a 5' to 3' direction, producing a complementary RNA sequence based on the DNA template. The resulting primary transcript will include non-coding sequences known as introns and exons - protein coding sequences. The intronic sequences will be removed and the exonic sequences will be joined together in a process known as splicing to produce a mature messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule.

Maturation of RNA also involves capping, tailing, and editing of primary transcripts. Capping refers to the addition of a 7-methylguanosine cap to the 5' end of the mRNA molecule, which prevents 5'-3' degradation and facilitates translation of mRNA into a protein sequence. Tailing is the addition of a polyadenosine tail at the 3' end of mRNA to promote nuclear export and translational regulation of the transcript. RNA editing can replace specific nucleotides to increase mRNA sequence diversity and role of the encoded protein product.  

The technique of molecular cloning, specifically the use of plasmids as vectors, has proved invaluable for the isolation and study of primary RNA transcripts and DNA fragments. Plasmids are circular DNA molecules, separate from cellular chromosomes, that can replicate independently within bacterial cells. They act as vectors by incorporating foreign DNA fragments that can then be amplified and studied. Plasmids containing DNA fragments are inserted into bacteria, and as the bacteria grow and multiply, the plasmids also replicate, producing multiple copies of the inserted DNA fragment. The bacteria can then be lysed and the plasmids harvested and studied.

In summary, transcription is a fundamental biological process critical for gene expression that results in primary transcripts which are processed into mature mRNA molecules. Molecular cloning techniques, using plasmids as vectors to isolate and amplify DNA fragments, have enabled the study of transcriptional mechanisms and regulation.
