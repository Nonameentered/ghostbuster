Here is a draft 1500-word essay addressing the prompt:

Mancur Olson's theory of dictatorship, democracy and distribution of power and its effect on economic growth can help explain why democracies tend to economically outperform autocracies over time.  In his 1993 book ‘Power and Prosperity’, Olson argues that concentrated power under dictatorships leads to rent seeking behavior and economic stagnation, whereas the dispersed power under democracies fosters prosperity.

Under dictatorships, power is concentrated with a few individuals, usually an authoritarian leader, the military, and a handful of political elites. These groups are able to act as ‘stationary bandits’ that monopolize and extract much of the resources and wealth in a society. They have little incentive to promote policies that drive long-term economic growth since their primary goal is self-enrichment and maintaining power. Any economic growth that does occur under autocracy likely only benefits the ruling elite, not the broader population. 

For example, during Mobutu Sese Seko’s reign over Zaire from 1965 to 1997, he and his cronies amassed huge personal fortunes by extracting natural resource wealth and foreign aid, while the broader economy stagnated and much of the population lived in extreme poverty. Similarly, researchers estimate that billions of dollars in oil revenue under Saddam Hussein’s Iraq were diverted to Hussein’s regime and unproductive projects, depriving the economy of investment and growth. These are examples of the ‘stationary bandit’ effect in action.

In contrast, democracies have dispersed power across many groups and individuals. This makes rent seeking behavior more difficult since no one group fully controls the levers of power or economy. The incentives are also aligned for politicians in democracies to promote economic growth, as that is what voters and citizens broadly prefer and reward. Democratic policies, like protection of property rights, open trade, investment in public goods, tend to be growth promoting. 

For example, many developing democracies, like South Korea and Taiwan, experienced rapid economic growth and industrialization under democratic rule starting in the 1960s and 1970s. Leaders pursued export-led growth policies to drive job growth and economic mobility. In India, rapid growth only took off after economic reforms in 1991 when the country moved further toward democracy and open markets. The dispersion of power in these democracies fostered policies that encouraged long-run growth.

In conclusion, Mancur Olson's theory of economic growth under different regime types helps show why democracies have a long-run economic advantage. Democracies with dispersed power are less susceptible to rent seeking and pursue more inclusive, pro-growth policies compared to autocracies where power is concentrated. Historical examples across Africa, Asia, and elsewhere provide evidence to support this theory of democracy, dictatorship and development.
