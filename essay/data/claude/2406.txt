Organic farming has several advantages as well as challenges. On the positive side, organic farming is better for the environment since it avoids the use of harmful chemicals and pesticides. It is also better for human health as organic produce is not contaminated with toxic residues. Organic farming methods also help sustain soil health and fertility over the long run. 

However, organic farming faces significant challenges. Crop yields are typically lower in organic farming, so more land is needed to produce the same amount of food. Organic food is also more labor-intensive since mechanical and chemical methods cannot be used. This often makes organic food more expensive for consumers. Organic farms also face challenges controlling weeds, pests, and diseases without the use of pesticides and herbicides.

 Sheepdrove Organic Farm in the UK addresses these challenges through innovative farming practices paired with strategic marketing. They use time-intensive methods like hand-weeding and composting to address weed and soil fertility issues. They also use natural pest control methods and breed pest-resistant crop varieties.
