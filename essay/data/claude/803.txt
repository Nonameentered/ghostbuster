The aim of the experiment to calculate the Darcy friction factor for oil flow in a pipe was to determine the pressure drop in the pipe due to friction for a given flow rate and pipe dimensions. The Darcy friction factor is a dimensionless quantity that describes the friction losses in a pipe and depends on the Reynolds number of the flow, the pipe roughness, and the geometry of the pipe. By calculating the friction factor, we can determine the energy losses in the system due to friction which helps in designing efficient piping networks and predicting flow parameters.

The experiment was carried out using a horizontal pipe made of steel with an inner diameter of 0.0250 meters and a length of 30 meters. Oil with a density of 850 kg/m3 and viscosity of 0.067 Paâ‹…s was allowed to flow through the pipe at different volumetric flow rates ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 m3/s. The pressure drop across the length of the pipe was measured for each flow rate using pressure transducers and the readings were recorded using a data acquisition system.

The results of the experiment showed that the pressure drop increased with increasing flow rate, as expected. At lower flow rates, the pressure drop was low but increased steeply with flow rate. At higher flow rates, the increase in pressure drop with flow rate was more gradual. The friction factor was calculated for each flow rate using the Darcy-Weisbach equation. The friction factor decreased with increasing Reynolds number, following the expected trend for fully turbulent flow in smooth pipes. At lower Reynolds numbers, below 104, the friction factor was higher but dropped steeply with increasing Re. At higher Re beyond 105, the decrease in friction factor with Re was more gradual. 

In conclusion, the experiment was successful in determining the friction factor for oil flow in pipes over a range of Reynolds numbers in the turbulent flow regime. The results show the dependence of friction factor on Reynolds number for smooth pipe flow as expected from theory. The friction factor can now be used to determine pressure drops for different flow rates in similar piping systems and also help predict flow parameters which is useful for engineering design applications. The experiment has validated our understanding of friction losses in piping systems under turbulent flow conditions.
