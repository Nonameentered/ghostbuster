There are several prominent theories of international relations that aim to explain the interactions between states and the global system of politics. Three of the most influential are Realism, Liberalism, and Marxism. Each theory is based on certain assumptions about human nature, the international system, and historical evidence, which in turn determine their efficacy and usefulness as explanations for international relations.  

Realism is an influential theory that assumes the international system is anarchic, meaning there is no higher authority above states, and that states are the primary actors concerned with power and security. For Realists like Hans Morgenthau, the primary determinants of state behavior are considerations of power and a self-interested human nature. Realism's assumptions tend to portray international relations as a struggle for power in an anarchic system, evidenced by events like the Peloponnesian Wars in Ancient Greece. However, Realism's focus on power and anarchy cannot fully explain cooperation between states or the influence of non-state actors. Its assumptions about human nature as solely self-interested are also problematic. So while Realism provides a persuasive explanation for some events, its assumptions limit its utility as an all-encompassing theory.

Liberalism begins with very different assumptions about human nature and the international system. Liberals like Woodrow Wilson argue that human nature is not fixed and that cooperation is possible. Liberals see factors like international institutions, trade, and democratization as promoting cooperation and peace between states. Historical evidence for Liberalism includes the rise of free trade in the 19th century and the post-World War II order based on international institutions like the United Nations. However, Liberalism struggles to explain conflict between democracies or in areas where institutions and trade are weak. Its optimistic assumptions can also lead to naivete about international politics. So Liberalism provides a useful counterpoint to Realism but requires balancing with Realism's insights.   

Finally, Marxism sees economics and class as the primary drivers of the international system. For Marxists, the capitalist system pits the capitalist and working classes against each other, which in turn shapes international relations. Historical evidence for Marxism includes imperialism and wars that were influenced by capitalism and the search for new resources and markets. However, Marxism's focus on economics as the sole determinant of international relations is too narrow and fails to explain cooperation between capitalist states or events unrelated to the economy. Its revolutionary assumptions also do not account for the persistence of capitalism and Liberal democracies. So, Marxism provides a provocative class-based theory but lacks explanatory power as a comprehensive theory of international relations.  

In conclusion, while each theory provides insights into international relations, they are also limited by their assumptions and historical evidence. Realism highlights anarchy and power but overlooks cooperation; Liberalism illuminates cooperation but assumes too much harmony; Marxism insightfully points to economics but fails to explain politics unrelated to class. The most persuasive understanding comes from synthesizing these theories based on their strengths and limitations as well as empirical evidence â€”looking to their assumptions and historical records to ground them as useful but imperfect tools for explaining the complex realities of international relations.
