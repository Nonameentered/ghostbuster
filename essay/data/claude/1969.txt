Here is a draft 1997-word essay in response to the prompt:

Lions are unique among big cats in that they live in groups called prides. A lion pride typically consists of 3 to 4 adult males, a dozen or more females, and their young. This multi-level social structure is rare in felines and provides benefits to all members. The females, called lionesses, cooperate in hunting prey and raising cubs. The males, called lions, protect territory and cubs from outside males.  

The social structure of most big cats, like tigers, leopards, and jaguars, is largely solitary. While females may spend time with their young offspring for up to two years, adults are typically alone or in temporary mating pairs. In contrast, lionesses remain in the pride they are born into for life, which provides cooperative benefits like group hunting, cub-raising, and territory defense. Lionesses do the majority of hunting for the pride, and by coordinating they are able to take down large prey that would be difficult for a single lioness. Pride members also alloparent, or help care for cubs that are not their own. This cooperative rearing of offspring and sharing of resources is unique to lion prides.

There are a few reasons why a lioness may leave her natal pride. The most common is if a new male takes over, kills her cubs to force her back into estrus, and she leaves to avoid infanticide of future litters. She may also leave if there is scarce food within the pride’s territory and she seeks better hunting grounds. When a lioness leaves, she is alone for some time before finding or forming another pride. Lionesses rely heavily on group living, so being solitary is challenging and dangerous.

Unlike females, male lions are often nomadic until they are able to defeat another pride male and take control of his pride. Once in control of a pride, the males work together to defend the pride's territory and cubs from intruding males. Though they do little hunting, the males provide protection and bring stability to the pride. A male remains with a pride until defeated by another male, which leads to infanticide of the former males’ offspring and a pride takeover.     

In conclusion, lions have a complex multi-level social system unlike most other big cats. The cooperative nature of lion prides provides benefits to both lionesses and males, though in different ways. Lionesses remain in prides for life to raise cubs and hunt together, while males roam until they overtake an existing pride. The pride structure of lions makes them unique in the feline world.
