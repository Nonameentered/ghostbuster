Here is a draft 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Sheepdrove Organic Farm in Berkshire, England operates a profitable free range poultry enterprise that produces high-quality organic chicken and eggs. The farm has several unique features that allow it to raise poultry in a humane, sustainable manner while still maintaining commercial viability. 

First, Sheepdrove utilizes a holistic system of agriculture that aims to mimic natural ecosystems. The farm is home to sheep, cattle, and poultry, with the animals rotationally grazing on pesticide-free pastures and the chickens ranging freely during the day. The manure from the ruminants helps naturally fertilize the soil, and the poultry are able to forage for worms and grubs in the grass. This integrated, symbiotic system reduces the need for external inputs and helps create a balanced, bio-diverse environment for the animals.

Second, Sheepdrove provides ample living space for its free range chickens. The chickens are housed in large barns with plenty of nesting space, perches, and areas to scratch and dust bathe. When the weather permits, the chickens have access to spacious fenced paddocks and pastures. On average, Sheepdrove provides over three times the living space mandated by free range standards in the EU. This extensive, low-stress housing promotes the chickens' natural behaviors and good health.

Finally, Sheepdrove slaughters its poultry on-site in an organic-certified abattoir. This allows the farm to maintain high welfare standards right through to slaughter and ensures meat integrity and quality. All the poultry are sourced from the farm's own flocks. Slaughtering on-site also significantly reduces the environmental footprint that comes from transporting live animals long distances. 

However, producing organic, high-welfare poultry meat does present certain challenges. The costs of organic feed, extensive housing, and on-site processing are high compared to intensive, industrial poultry production. Organic standards also limit the scale of the operation. These factors mean that free range organic chicken can cost significantly more than standard poultry. Sheepdrove is able to command a higher price point by focusing on quality and connecting consumers to the provenance of their food. But high prices may be off-putting and limit market size.

In summary, Sheepdrove Organic Farm has created a sustainable model for commercial free range poultry. Its holistic system, high welfare standards, and on-site abattoir allow it to produce premium organic chicken and eggs. However, the costs of organic production and limits to scale pose challenges in making free range poultry affordable and accessible to more consumers. With its premium products and farm education programs, Sheepdrove is well positioned to continue leading the growth of high-quality organic free range poultry in the UK.
