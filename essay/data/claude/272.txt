There are a number of potential criminal offenses that could be charged against Felicity and Amy based on the incidents described. The key offenses to consider are assault, battery, theft, robbery, break and enter, mischief, and criminal harassment. However, whether or not Felicity and Amy are criminally liable for these offenses depends on several factors, including the specific elements of each offense, whether their actions meet those elements, their mental state, and the fairness of labeling their behavior as criminal.

The first incident involves Felicity slapping Amy across the face in the school hallway. This could constitute the offenses of assault and battery. Assault refers to intentionally applying force to another person without their consent. Battery specifically refers to physical contact. Felicity intentionally slapped Amy, making physical contact without her consent, so she could be liable for assault and battery. However, these offenses also require that the force applied be unlawful and harm or offend the victim. If Felicity's slap was considered minor and caused no real harm or offense, she may not meet these elements. Her young age and immaturity may also be a mitigating factor. 
 
The second incident involves Amy stealing Felicity's bracelet from her locker and throwing it down the sewer drain. This could be theft under $5000 or mischief. Theft requires taking something that does not belong to you with the intent to deprive the owner. Amy took Felicity's bracelet without permission and threw it away, intending to deprive her of it, so she could be liable for theft. Mischief refers to willfully damaging or destroying another's property. By throwing the bracelet down the sewer, Amy willfully damaged Felicity's property, so could also be liable for mischief. However, if the bracelet was of little value, the charges may be considered overly harsh and inconsistent with the principle of fair labeling. Amy's young age may also mitigate her liability.

The third incident involves Felicity breaking into Amy's locker and covering her belongings in pink paint. This could be break and enter as well as mischief. Breaking into a place, in this case Amy's locker, with intent to commit an offense inside constitutes break and enter. Felicity broke into Amy's locker and willfully damaged her property by covering it in paint, so she could be criminally liable for both offenses. However, the same considerations around the minor nature of the offense and Felicity's age apply here as well. Labelling this behavior as criminal may be unfair given the context.  

In summary, while Felicity and Amy's actions could constitute several criminal offenses, their young age, the relatively minor nature of the incidents, and the need to fairly label them as criminals suggest their liability for these offenses may be limited. The specific circumstances of each incident must be taken into account to determine appropriate consequences and responses. Focusing on restorative justice and rehabilitation rather than criminal punishment may be most suitable given Felicity and Amy's ages.
