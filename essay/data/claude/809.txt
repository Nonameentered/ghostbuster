The Biennio Rosso ("two Red years") between 1919 and 1920 was a period of revolutionary ferment in Italy. There were widespread strikes, factory occupations, armed clashes between leftists and the state, and a surge in popularity and militancy of both socialist and anarchist groups. However, this period of upheaval ultimately gave way to Benito Mussolini and the Fascist Party establishing control of the country by 1922. There were several key factors that enabled fascism to take hold in Italy during this time and overcome the radical left.

First, the radical left was deeply divided and unable to unite against the threat of fascism. The two largest factions were the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and the General Confederation of Labour (CGdL) trade union federation, but there were many splits and rivalries within these groups as well as with anarchists and communists. They failed to form a common platform or coordinate activities, instead frequently fighting each other over ideological differences and for control of unions and councils. This left them weakened in the face of the rising Fascist movement. Had they been able to overcome their differences and unite, they may have posed a more formidable opposition.   

Second, the liberal establishment largely failed to support the left and democracy. The liberal Italian government was almost entirely reactive during this period, violently suppressing leftist uprisings and protests but failing to enact meaningful political or economic reforms to address their root causes. The industrialists and landed elite were terrified of the radical left, so they funded and supported the Fascists as a "counterweight," enabling their rise. The liberal political parties and media also failed to condemn or oppose Mussolini forcefully until it was too late. With no allies in government or civil society, the left stood alone.

Third, the Fascist movement outmaneuvered the left politically and cultivated a populist appeal. Mussolini built a broad coalition of disaffected nationalists, industrialists, landowners, and small businessmen. The Fascists employed violence and intimidation but also portrayed themselves as champions of law and order who could unite and revitalize the nation.  They successfully scapegoated socialists and tapped into fears of revolution and Bolshevism. All this allowed the Fascists to gain mainstream conservative and Catholic support that helped them seize power legally through the October 1922 March on Rome. 

While a united left may have altered these dynamics, there were significant obstacles to unity. The deep ideological divisions and sectarianism would have been hard to overcome without compromise, and the groups distrusted each other. Even still, coordinated direct action and political pressure may have isolated the Fascists, forced the government to enact meaningful reforms to undercut support for the right, and compelled the elite to defend democracy rather than funding its enemies. A singular, consistent voice against Mussolini in the liberal press and politics may have also made a difference. In the end, fragmentation and division became a self-fulfilling prophecy for the Italian left during this crucial period. Their failure in this regard opened the door for fascism to take hold and ultimately prevail.
