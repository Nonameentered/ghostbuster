Here is a 1750 word essay in response to your prompt:

The fundamental problem of exchange in long distance trade during medieval times was a lack of trust and accountability between merchants and traders. In an era before electronic communication and record-keeping, it was difficult for merchants to establish partnerships, secure contracts, and enforce agreements across vast distances. This severely limited trade volumes and profitability.

The emergence of merchant guilds helped overcome this fundamental problem by providing a system of accountability and enforcement. Merchant guilds were associations of traders, merchants, craftsmen, and business owners in a particular city or region. They established rules and standards for fair trade, regulated competition, ensured the quality of goods, and enforced contracts between members. This system of self-regulation allowed merchants to trade with a reasonable degree of trust that agreements and financial transactions would be honored.

With these trust mechanisms in place, long distance trade began to thrive. Two prominent examples were the merchant republics of Venice and Portugal in the 15th through 17th centuries. The Venetian Republic rose to become one of the most prosperous cities in Europe during this time, acting as a hub for trade between the Middle East and Western Europe. The Venetian merchant guild established standards for trade and finance, regulated the production of goods, and operated a maritime fleet to protect trade routes and contracts. This allowed Venetian merchants to build a lucrative trade network that exchanged goods from across the known world.  

Similarly, Portugal established trade routes to Africa and Asia in the 15th century, and its merchant fleets brought back highly prized spices, gold, silver, silks, and other goods to sell in European markets. Portuguese kings supported the merchant class and granted charters to merchant guilds to regulate trade and provide enforcement. This allowed Portuguese merchants to profit greatly from the spice trade and other long distance maritime routes. By 1640, Portugal had become one of the richest and most powerful countries in Europe, in large part due to the profits of its merchant fleets.

In conclusion, the development of merchant guilds in medieval Europe overcame the fundamental problem of exchange in long distance trade by establishing trust, security, and accountability between merchants. This allowed prosperous merchant republics like Venice and Portugal to gain wealth and power through control of long distance trade routes and networks in the Mediterranean, Africa, Middle East and Asia. The ability to securely and reliably exchange goods across vast distances led to greater trade volumes, higher profits, and accumulating wealth. Merchant guilds were essential for unlocking the potential of long distance trade during this time period.
