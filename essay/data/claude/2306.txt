Here is a draft 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

Breast cancer develops due to genetic changes that accumulate in breast cells over a person's lifetime. These changes can be inherited or acquired sporadically as cells divide and accumulate mutations during a person's life. Inherited mutations are passed down from parents to children through mutations in high-penetrance breast cancer susceptibility genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. These genes are important for maintaining genome integrity and DNA repair. Mutations in them significantly increase the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer.

Sporadic mutations, on the other hand, happen randomly as cells divide. They alter genes that regulate cell growth and proliferation, causing cells to grow out of control. Two of the most commonly mutated genes in sporadic breast cancers are TP53 and PIK3CA. TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene that normally protects against cancer by regulating cell growth and inducing apoptosis in cells with damaged DNA. Mutations in TP53 disrupt these functions and allow abnormal cells to proliferate. PIK3CA activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, which promotes cell growth and survival. Activating mutations in PIK3CA lead to overactivation of this pathway, fueling the growth of cancer cells. 

In addition to TP53 and PIK3CA, mutations also frequently occur in other oncogenes like HER2, FGFR1, and cyclin D1 and tumor suppressor genes like PTEN, RB1, and CDH1. HER2 amplifications activate growth factor signaling and are targeted in HER2-positive breast cancers. Mutations in FGFR1, a receptor for fibroblast growth factors, also activate growth signaling. Cyclin D1 is involved in cell cycle progression, and its overexpression can drive abnormal cell proliferation. PTEN, RB1, and CDH1 are tumor suppressors that regulate cell growth and adhesion; their loss contributes to tumorigenesis.

Overall, while inherited mutations in genes like BRCA1/2 may predispose individuals to breast cancer, sporadic mutations accumulating over time are required for the development of most breast tumors. These mutations alter many parts of the complex molecular machinery that regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, and genome stability. Multiple mutations across these interconnected systems are needed to overcome checkpoints, evade growth suppression, enable immortal cell proliferation, and support other hallmarks of cancer. Targeting the products of mutated genes such as HER2 and hormonal receptors has revolutionized breast cancer treatment. Continued study of the genes and pathways mutated in breast cancer will fuel the discovery of new targeted therapies and improvements in patient outcomes.
