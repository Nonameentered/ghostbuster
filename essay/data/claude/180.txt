The English East India Company (EIC), founded in 1600, established and expanded its control over parts of India in the 17th and 18th centuries. The EIC's engagement with both the Indian elites as well as the broader population significantly shaped its development and operations in India in a number of ways. 

The EIC realized early on that it needed to work with local Indian elites, rulers and traders to advance its commercial and political interests. When the EIC first established trading outposts in Surat and Madras in the early 1600s, it forged alliances and secured trading rights with the Mughal rulers and local governors. These alliances allowed the EIC to gain privileged access to trade and resources. As the Mughal Empire weakened in the 18th century, the EIC allied with and supported local rulers like the Nawabs of Bengal and the Nizams of Hyderabad. In return, the EIC gained tax revenues, trading monopolies and territory. By allying with Indian elites, the EIC was able to leverage their influence, resources and military power to its advantage. 

At the same time, the EIC realized it needed the cooperation and participation of the broader Indian population to sustain its enterprises. As the EIC transitioned from trade to territorial rule, it relied on local populations for tax revenues, soldiers, artisans, farmers, traders, and laborers. The EIC made efforts to gain the consent and participation of local populations. It maintained existing power structures and tax systems, and co-opted local nobles and landlords to help govern and collect revenue. The EIC promoted trade and lowered tariffs to gain the support of traders and merchants. It recruited Indian sepoys and soldiers into its armies, offering them status and pay. While the EIC exploited local populations for resources and labor, its rule ultimately depended on a degree of consent and participation. 

The EIC's engagement with Indian groups was also shaped by conflict and resistance. As the EIC expanded its control, it faced opposition from rulers whose power it challenged, from populations subject to high taxes, and from groups it excluded from power. The EIC fought wars against Indian rulers like the Nawabs of Bengal and the Marathas who posed threats to its interests. Rebellions like the Santal rebellion of 1855 showed the resentment of populations exploited under EIC rule. At the same time, groups like princely states, landlords, and sepoys depended on and supported the EIC when it was in their interest to do so. The EIC, in turn, made accommodations to gain allies and supporters, even as it used force against opponents.

In conclusion, the English East India Company was shaped in fundamental ways by its engagement with Indian elites and populations. It forged alliances with local rulers and gained territory, taxes and trade monopolies. It relied on local populations for revenues, resources, soldiers and labor. And it faced both cooperation and conflict, gaining allies as well as provoking wars and rebellions. Through a combination of military force and accommodation, the EIC was able to leverage Indian groups to gain power and territory in India, even as its rule remained unstable and contentious. Its complex and evolving engagements with Indian elites and populations were instrumental in enabling its rise and influence in India during the 17th and 18th centuries.
