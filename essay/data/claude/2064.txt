Waitrose's organic customers are likely to differ in several ways from the average organic consumer. Firstly, Waitrose's customers tend to be higher income individuals. As Waitrose is a more premium grocery store, it attracts affluent customers who can afford to shop there regularly. This means Waitrose's organic customers likely have higher disposable incomes and more financial means to spend on organic and premium products compared to the average organic consumer. 

Secondly, Waitrose's customers are probably more educated about health, nutrition and the environment. Waitrose places an emphasis on high-quality, fresh, and sustainable products. This focus attracts customers who care about issues like human health, climate change, and organic and natural ingredients. Waitrose's organic customers are therefore probably quite well-informed about the benefits of organic food and farming. They choose organic not just for its perceived superiority but out of genuine concern for health, ethics and sustainability.

Thirdly, Waitrose's organic customers likely have a strong loyalty to the Waitrose brand. Waitrose inspires a sense of brand trust and premium quality in its shoppers. Its organic customers probably prefer to do most or all of their grocery shopping at Waitrose because they appreciate the brand and believe in its organic and ethical values. They are willing to pay more to shop at Waitrose compared to other supermarkets.

Based on these characteristics, Waitrose can tailor a marketing strategy for its organic products as follows:

1) Premium positioning: Position Waitrose's organic range as premium to match its affluent customer base. Use high-quality design and packaging and do not emphasize low prices. Focus on the superior taste, quality and benefits of the products. 

2) Education: Educate customers further about the benefits of organic food and farming. Share details on the provenance and sustainability credentials of products. Help customers make informed choices. This approach matches Waitrose's educated customer profile.

3) Brand loyalty: Build on the strong brand loyalty of Waitrose's organic customers. Run promotions, events and campaigns tailored for these loyal buyers. Encourage them to do more of their grocery shopping at Waitrose through loyalty programs and rewards. Reinforce Waitrose as the place for organic and premium food.  

In summary, Waitrose's organic customers differ significantly from average organic consumers in income, education and brand loyalty. By leveraging these characteristics with a premium, educational marketing strategy focused on brand loyalty, Waitrose can strengthen its appeal to its core organic customers. The key is aligning the organic product range with what Waitrose's customers already expect and love about the brand.
