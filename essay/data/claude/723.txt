The popular notion that motherhood is a core part of women's destiny and identity is a widely held belief that contributes to the ongoing oppression of women in society. The expectation that women should fulfill their purpose through motherhood is a construct that has been perpetuated throughout history and continues to negatively impact women today in numerous ways. 

Maternal instinct and women's desire for motherhood are often assumed to be innate or biological drives. However, there is little evidence that an innate maternal instinct actually exists in humans. While women are capable of mothering and nurturing due to physiological factors like the ability to give birth and breastfeed, the desire to become a mother is largely due to social and cultural expectations. Girls are taught from an early age that motherhood is a natural and expected step in a woman's life, and those who do not aspire to become mothers are viewed as strange or unnatural. The notion of a universal maternal instinct serves to make motherhood seem like the natural destiny and purpose for all women.

The belief that motherhood represents the pinnacle of a woman's life and accomplishments actively works to limit women's choices and potential. Women face societal pressures to prioritize family and children over their own aspirations or careers. While motherhood brings joy to many women, the expectation that all women should become mothers denies individuals the opportunity to pursue other life paths. When motherhood is seen as destiny, women who do not desire children can feel like outsiders who have failed at their prescribed purpose. 

The cultural pressure on women to become mothers contributes to the cycle of their subordination by restricting their identities to traditionally feminine gender roles. When motherhood is portrayed as a woman's most significant source of status and purpose, it perpetuates stereotypes that limit women's worth and value to their roles as nurturers and caregivers. While choosing to become a mother can be personally empowering, the societal expectation of motherhood as destiny is disempowering to women as a group. It positions women in a supportive role to others rather than as autonomous individuals in their own right.

Alternative models to the traditional division of parenting roles provide examples of how motherhood could be transformed from an expectation into a choice. Greater shared responsibility for child rearing and domestic tasks between fathers and mothers could help reframe mothering as a role that is not exclusively linked to the biological capabilities or destiny of women.  Parenting could come to be viewed as a shared social responsibility and joy between partners, rather than a woman's predetermined purpose.  

In conclusion, while motherhood may be personally fulfilling and meaningful for many women, it should not be prescribed as the purpose or destiny for women in general. Only when women have a diversity of life options and choices available to them, and are supported in pursuing their own interests and visions of a meaningful life, will they achieve full empowerment and equality in society. Motherhood needs to be reframed as one opportunity or choice among many, rather than an inevitable source of either identity or subordination for women. Societal expectations that position motherhood as an integral part of a woman's purpose and destiny serve only to perpetuate the ongoing oppression of women.
