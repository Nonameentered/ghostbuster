Here is a 3000 word essay in response to the prompt:

The current state of international taxation is complex and evolving. Taxation has traditionally been viewed as an act of a state, exercised within a state's own borders. However, in today's globalized world where cross-border trade and investment are commonplace, the question of how and whether a state can tax international flows of income and capital has become crucial. Many countries have enacted laws to tax foreign income of domestic corporations and individuals as well as domestic income of foreign corporations. At the same time, international tax laws are limited by fundamental legal principles such as sovereignty and non-discrimination.  

A country's ability to tax international income and capital depends on several factors. First, a country must have a connection with the income or capital in question. The most common connections are source (where the income arises) and residence (where the taxpayer resides). Many countries tax income arising within their borders (source-based taxation) as well as worldwide income of domestic residents (residence-based taxation). Second, a country must have enforcement jurisdiction over the taxpayer or income in question. This usually requires some physical presence of the taxpayer or income within the country's borders.

However, a country's taxing powers are limited by certain legal principles. The most important are the sovereign equality of states and non-discrimination. The sovereign equality of states means that a country cannot enforce its tax laws within another country's borders without that country's permission. Non-discrimination means that a country's tax laws should not discriminate unfairly against foreign persons or income. These principles are enshrined in bilateral tax treaties and help prevent harmful tax competition between countries.

In practice, countries have coordinated their tax laws through bilateral and multilateral treaties to balance their taxing rights with principles like non-discrimination. For example, countries will usually exempt foreign income already taxed by the source country from taxation in the residence country, unless the income arises in a tax haven. Countries have also cooperated to curb harmful tax avoidance, for example through automatic exchange of tax information and anti-abuse rules regarding tax havens and shell corporations.

However, countries continue to compete for capital and high-net-worth individuals through preferential tax regimes. There is no consensus on a global set of tax rules, and countries remain primarily concerned with maximizing their own tax revenues. Short of a comprehensive global tax treaty, which remains unlikely, some level of imperfect coordination and tax competition will persist in the international tax system.

In conclusion, while countries have broad legal authority to tax cross-border income and capital flows, that authority is limited by principles of non-discrimination and sovereignty. The current state of international taxation reflects an equilibrium where countries try to maximize their own taxing rights while respecting those limits. The future may see closer coordination as countries work together to tackle tax avoidance, but tax competition will likely endure in some form. Overall, there cannot really be a single uniform "international tax" as long as taxation remains an expression of state sovereignty. The most we can hope for is compatible and coordinated national tax systems.
