Here is a draft 2250 word essay in response to the prompt:

Social capital refers to connections among individuals and networks, relationships of trust, and norms of reciprocity that arise from those connections. It has been widely theorized as a useful concept in relation to development as high levels of social capital are associated with positive development outcomes. However, there are multiple formulations of the social capital concept and its role is contested and complex. 

The earliest formulation of social capital was proposed by Bourdieu in the 1980s. He saw social capital as an individual benefit stemming from social connections and networks. According to Bourdieu, individuals can gain social capital through participation in networks and social connections that provide access to resources and power. This formulation views social capital as enabling unequal access to opportunities and the reproduction of inequality in society. In contrast, Putnam's formulation of the concept emphasizes its communal benefits. According to Putnam, high levels of volunteering, civic participation and trust in communities indicate high stocks of social capital. This results in positive outcomes for development such as government efficiency, education, economic growth, and well-being. The World Bank and other international institutions have adopted this view of social capital as a key determinant of positive development outcomes.

However, the role of social capital in development is complex. While studies show a correlation between high social capital and better developmental outcomes, the direction of causality is unclear. In many cases, it may be that development contributes to building social capital rather than the other way around. Social capital tends to be higher in more affluent societies, so it could be a product rather than a cause of development. The relationship between social capital and development outcomes also depends on contextual and cultural factors. What constitutes social capital and how it relates to trust, cooperation and collective action varies significantly across societies and communities.  

The role of states and institutions is pivotal in enabling the accumulation and mobilization of social capital. However, their role can be both positive and negative. States can actively build social capital through investments in education, healthcare and social programs. They can promote civic organizations, community groups and social participation. Conversely, by imposing excessive control, restrictions or violence, states can also erode social capital. Discriminatory institutions and policies can exacerbate inequality by providing opportunities for social connections and mobility only to privileged groups. Corruption within government institutions can also undermine trust in the system and damage social ties.

In conclusion, while social capital remains a useful concept to understand cooperation, trust and networks within societies, its relationship to development is complex. Multiple formulations exist with different views on how social capital is accumulated and what constitutes its resources. The role of states and institutions in supporting social capital formation is pivotal yet mixed. Overall, social capital has the potential for positive development outcomes, but this depends on societal, cultural and institutional contexts. Higher levels of social capital do not necessarily translate into improved development, and more research is needed to clarify the direction of causality and relationships between the different dimensions of this multifaceted concept.
