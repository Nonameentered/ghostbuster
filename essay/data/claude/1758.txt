The hotel industry faces many significant threats, both domestically and internationally, that have significantly impacted the operations and financial performance of major hotel groups, including Hilton International. Some of the major threats facing the industry include:

•Economic downturns and recessions. The hotel industry is highly sensitive to fluctuations in the overall economy. During economic downturns and recessions, businesses and individuals often reduce travel budgets, which directly impacts hotel occupancy rates and revenue. The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 led to a sharp drop in hotel occupancy and revenue for Hilton and other major hotel groups. Hilton's revenue per available room (RevPAR) declined over 25% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to the recession. Recessions also make it more difficult for hotels to raise room rates. 

•Health crises and epidemics. Widespread health issues like SARS, MERS, Ebola, and now COVID-19 pose threats to the hotel industry by reducing overall travel and causing people to avoid crowded places like hotels. The COVID-19 pandemic has been particularly devastating, leading to an over 50% drop in Hilton's RevPAR and occupancy in the first quarter of 2020. Health crises also require increased safety and hygiene protocols to reassure guests, increasing costs for hotel operators.

•Geopolitical events. Geopolitical events like terrorism, wars, political instability, and natural disasters can deter tourism and business travel, reducing hotel occupancy. For example, the 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and wars in the Middle East impacted travel to those regions. Hilton likely saw drops in RevPAR for hotels in areas affected by geopolitical events. 

•Increased competition. The hotel industry is highly competitive, with many hotel groups competing for the same guests. Increased competition, especially from large international hotel chains, threatens RevPAR and occupancy levels. Hilton faces competition from chains like Marriott, Hyatt, and Accor, as well as independent boutique hotels. To remain competitive, Hilton has invested heavily in marketing, loyalty programs, differentiated brands, and high service quality.

•Sharing economy. The rise of Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms poses a major threat to traditional hotels. Airbnb offers travelers more unique, affordable accommodation options, appealing to value-conscious guests and impacting hotel demand, especially for extended stays. Hilton and other hotels have likely lost some guests to Airbnb and have tried to match experiences offered on the platform. 

In summary, the major threats facing the hotel industry like economic, health, geopolitical, and competitive threats have significantly challenged operations at Hilton International and other leading hotel groups. However, Hilton has taken measures, including brand differentiation, digital innovation, and growth into new segments, to mitigate risks from these threats over the long run.
