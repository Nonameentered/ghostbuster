While significant progress has been made in reducing racism and promoting racial diversity and inclusion, racism continues to persist in contemporary society. There are several reasons why racism still exists today, including culture, economics, and politics. 

Culturally, many people are raised in families and communities where racist beliefs and stereotypes are common. When children grow up frequently exposed to racist attitudes, it becomes normalized. They internalize those beliefs from an early age, and then continue to perpetuate and spread them as adults. This cycle continues across generations. Unexamined racist cultural assumptions are passed down, often without malicious intent but with damaging impact. Exposure to racist media, racially insensitive sports team names and mascots, and racial stereotypes in popular culture also contribute to the cultural persistence of racist attitudes. These cultural factors, combined with a lack of exposure to diversity, allow racist beliefs to thrive.

Economic anxiety and insecurity also continue to fuel racist sentiments. When people feel that their economic status is threatened, it can drive many to scapegoat other racial groups. Politicians and media figures sometimes stoke these fears by promoting racist stereotypes to argue that others are taking jobs or government resources. While economic concerns are understandable, racism is never the answer. A more equitable, inclusive economy that provides opportunity and security for people of all backgrounds is needed to help counter these tendencies.  

Finally, some politicians and political parties have used subtle or overt racism to gain or maintain power. By appealing to racist elements of their base or stoking racist fears, they are able to get more votes and support. Political leaders have significant influence, so racist rhetoric and policy proposals from politicians can alter public discourse and further normalize those views. At the same time, the lack of political will to enact policies promoting diversity, inclusion and racial equity allows systemic racism to persist. Strong, moral leadership is required to help remedy these issues, but too often that leadership is lacking.

In conclusion, culture, economics, and politics have all contributed to the persistence of racism in contemporary society. Promoting more inclusive values, building a fair and equitable economy, and demanding strong moral leadership are all necessary to making further progress against racism and building a more just and inclusive society. While the challenges ahead are complex, continued activism and advocacy offer hope for the future.
