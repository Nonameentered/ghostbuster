The late Pleistocene mass extinction saw the demise of large terrestrial mammal species, known as megafauna, across the globe. Over 60 genera of mammals weighing over 44 kilograms disappeared within a short period of time around 50,000 to 10,000 years ago. This extinction event had a massive impact on ecosystems around the world. There were likely multiple factors that contributed to this extinction, though the role of human hunting and overkill is still debated. 

One major factor in the megafauna extinctions was likely climate change. The Pleistocene was a period of significant fluctuations between glacial and interglacial periods. These climate changes resulted in shifts in vegetation and the availability of food sources for megafauna. For example, the loss of grassy steppes during interglacial warming periods would have deprived grazers of habitat and food sources. Climate change also potentially restricted populations to smaller geographic areas, making them more vulnerable. However, climate change alone likely does not fully explain the extinctions, as previous glacial-interglacial cycles did not result in such a mass extinction of megafauna.

A second factor was increased competition from smaller prey species and predators. As the climate shifted, some scientists argue that megafauna faced more competition for resources from smaller mammals and other predators. For example, wolves and other smaller predators may have competed more heavily with big cats like saber-toothed tigers. Smaller herbivores like deer may have outcompeted lumbering megaherbivores. However, competition from other animals also likely does not fully explain the extinctions, as megafauna had coexisted with smaller predators and competitors for millions of years before their sudden decline.

The spread of early human hunter-gatherers around the world coincided closely with the timing of the megafaunal extinctions. Humans were skilled hunters and there is evidence they preyed on megafauna for food and resources. While debate continues, many scientists argue that human overkill—the hunting of megafauna at rates that exceeded their capacity to replace themselves—was a major factor, and possibly the primary factor, in the late Pleistocene mass extinction. Humans, as novel predators in many areas, likely put additional pressure on megafauna populations that were already stressed by climate change and competition from other animals.

In conclusion, the late Pleistocene megafauna extinctions were likely the result of a combination of climate change, competition from other animals, and human overkill acting together. There is no scientific consensus on the relative importance of each factor. However, the role of human hunting in these extinctions should not be underestimated. The spread of humans around the globe coincided with and likely significantly contributed to the mass extinction of megafauna species that had inhabited Earth for millions of years. The loss of these massive mammals had lasting impacts on the development of ecosystems that persist today.
