Here is a draft 2750-word essay in response to the prompt:

The “permissive revolution” refers to the period between the mid-1960s and early 1970s in Britain that saw rapid social liberalization, particularly around issues of personal morality, sexuality, and gender roles. These changes were catalyzed by cultural, legislative, and attitudinal shifts that challenged more traditional views. However, different groups within British society viewed these changes very differently.  

Several cultural developments contributed to the permissive revolution. One was the rise of the counterculture, embodied in pop culture figures like The Beatles, who represented anti-establishment values and experimentation with drugs and new lifestyles. Their enormous popularity spread these countercultural values to the mainstream. The rise of feminism also brought more open attitudes about female sexuality, relationships, and gender roles. T he 1967 legalization of abortion and increased availability of oral contraceptives gave women more control over reproduction. 

Legislative changes also enabled the permissive revolution. The 1967 Sexual Offenses Act decriminalized homosexuality in England and Wales. The Divorce Reform Act of 1969 made it easier for couples to divorce. These laws liberalized attitudes and practices around sexuality and relationships. However, other legislation aimed to limit permissiveness, like the Street Offenses Act of 1959 which targeted prostitutes and “teddy boys.” Censorship laws also began allowing more explicit content in media, while local authorities battled obscenity.

Attitudinal shifts, especially among youth, also drove the permissive revolution. Postwar reconstruction and rising affluence gave young people more independence and willingness to challenge social norms. Increased access to higher education exposed students to more liberal values. A “generation gap” emerged as the younger generation rejected the mores of their parents. Surveys showed younger people adopting more permissive views about premarital sex, pornography, drugs, and other issues.      

However, permissiveness was not universal. Many in older and more conservative groups objected to the rapid pace of change and loss of traditional values. Institutions like the church, government, and media outlets like the Daily Mail gave voice to more restrictive views and attempts to curb permissiveness, though with limited success. There was a backlash against developments like the legalization of abortion and homosexuality. But overall, British society grew more permissive and progressive, especially among youth, in the 1960s and 70s.

In conclusion, the permissive revolution was driven by a combination of cultural, legislative and attitudinal changes that brought more liberal social attitudes, especially around issues of sexuality, morality and gender roles. While controversial, these changes permanently reshaped British society by normalizing more permissive and progressive views among younger generations.  Though still resisted by some, this revolution marked a turning point towards more liberal social values that shaped modern Britain.
