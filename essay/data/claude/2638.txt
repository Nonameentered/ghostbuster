Specific Language Impairment (SLI) is a developmental language disorder diagnosed in children who show significant difficulties acquiring language skills, in the absence of any other developmental delays, sensory impairments, or neurological damage. While SLI is diagnosed based primarily on impairments in verbal language abilities, research has shown that many children with SLI also exhibit deficits in non-verbal skills that relate to language and cognitive processing.

One area of non-verbal impairment relates to processing speed. Studies have found that children with SLI show slower speed of processing for a variety of non-verbal tasks, such as picture naming, object manipulation, and sequential finger tapping. Slower processing speed likely impacts their language abilities, as it may delay or limit their ability to efficiently process incoming verbal information, plan speech responses, and monitor their own speech. Slower non-verbal processing speed is also associated with lower working memory capacity in children with SLI, further limiting their cognitive resources for language.  

Children with SLI also frequently show impairments in visuospatial skills, such as block design, maze navigation, and memory for shapes and symbols. Strong visuospatial skills have been linked to better phonological awareness and reading ability, so deficits in this area may relate to the language challenges faced by children with SLI. Impairments in non-verbal reasoning and problem-solving have also been identified in some children with SLI. Although the exact relationship between these non-verbal skills and language ability is not fully understood, they likely draw on some of the same underlying cognitive processes, including working memory, processing speed, and cognitive flexibility.  

In summary, while SLI is primarily diagnosed based on verbal language impairments, research shows that non-verbal deficits in processing speed, visuospatial skills, and higher-order thinking also exist for many children with SLI. These non-verbal impairments relate to language ability in that they 1) impact the cognitive resources available for language processing, 2) involve some of the same or related skills and neural substrates as language, and 3) may arise from a common cause, such as a limitation in general processing capacity. Understanding non-verbal deficits in children with SLI provides a more comprehensive view of their language and cognitive profiles to support diagnosis, interventions, and long term outcomes. Overall, the relationship between verbal language and non-verbal skills in children with SLI suggests an interdependence that has significant implications for developmental progress in communication, social-emotional, and academic abilities.
