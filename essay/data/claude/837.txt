Here is a 1000 word essay in response to the prompt:

Alcohol abuse has both acute and chronic deleterious effects on the liver. In the acute phase, excessive alcohol consumption can lead to alcoholic hepatitis, acute inflammation of the liver. As the abuse continues over time, chronic liver damage manifests as alcoholic liver disease and cirrhosis. These conditions significantly impact health and mortality.

The signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal include tremors, anxiety, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, sweating, increased heart rate, and blood pressure. Seizures can also occur in severe cases. The recommended treatment is carefully monitored detoxification, IV fluids, benzodiazepines for anxiety and seizure prevention, and medications for nausea as needed. Thiamine and folate supplements help prevent Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

Healthcare providers should approach individuals struggling with alcohol use disorder and comorbid mental health conditions with understanding, empathy and compassion. A non-judgmental stance is critical. Providers should screen for co-occurring disorders and have strong referral networks to mental health professionals and support groups. Medication management and therapy should be tailored to the individual's needs. 

Ethical questions arise regarding liver transplant eligibility for patients with active alcohol use disorder due to organ scarcity and likelihood of relapse with return to alcohol use. However, denying a life-saving transplant based primarily on a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder raises ethical issues of its own, as addiction is considered a medical condition. Eligibility policies aim to establish a minimum alcohol-free period to ensure compliance with follow-up care. Multidisciplinary evaluation and support for addiction recovery can help establish transplant candidacy. Overall, a balanced, compassionate approach considering each individual's unique situation is warranted.

In summary, alcohol abuse causes acute and chronic liver damage with serious health consequences. Alcohol withdrawal is a medical syndrome requiring careful treatment and monitoring. Healthcare providers must show empathy, understanding and a non-judgmental attitude in caring for patients with alcohol use disorder and co-occurring conditions. Regarding liver transplants, a balanced perspective considering each patient's situation individually is most ethical. Policies should aim to provide a reasonable path to candidacy with multidisciplinary support for addiction recovery.
