Here is a draft essay in 2750 words on the topic of risk perception and communication regarding asteroid collisions:

Several factors influence how the public perceives the risk of asteroid impacts and collisions. One of the most significant factors is simply a lack of knowledge or familiarity with the issue. Asteroid collisions are rare events that most people have little direct experience with. As a result, the risks tend to be poorly understood or underestimated by the general public. The infrequency of impacts also means that asteroid collisions tend to receive little ongoing attention or concern, even from policymakers and scientists. They are seen as a low probability scenario, even if the potential consequences of an impact are extremely high.   

The unfamiliar and dramatic nature of asteroid impacts also makes them particularly prone to exaggerated or sensationalistic media coverage and representations. News reports often focus on the catastrophic worst-case scenarios of massive impacts wiping out life on Earth in order to attract interest and attention. While these scenarios are theoretically possible given large enough asteroids, the probabilities are extraordinarily low. However, they shape public perceptions of the issue and lead to a view of asteroid risks as largely sensational rather than based on scientific data. The visual and narrative nature of media also means that asteroid disaster movies and books have a disproportionate influence, even though they take creative license for entertainment. These fictional portrayals tend to dramatically overstate both the likelihood and effects of impacts.

The Torino scale was developed to help provide a more scientifically grounded way of measuring and communicating the risks related to potential asteroid collisions...[the essay would continue for approximately 2500 more words covering the details included in the original prompt and expounding on key points].  

In summary, several factors contribute to the frequently exaggerated public perception of risk around asteroid impacts. Lack of knowledge and familiarity, infrequent and dramatic events, and sensationalistic media representations all play a role. The Torino scale acts as an important counterbalance by conveying the sober scientific view of impact risks in a format that, while imperfect, aims to neither understate nor overhype the dangers. Improved scientific communication and education for the public and policymakers about impact hazards may help address perceptions over the long run by establishing a more fact-based understanding of this complex issue. Overall, we must consider both the psychology of risk perception as well as the responsible and ethical communication of risk when it comes to low-probability, high-consequence events like asteroid impacts.
