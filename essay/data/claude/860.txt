To what extent was Madame de Pompadour popular among both the courtiers at Versailles and the Parisian populace during her reign as Louis XV's official mistress?

Madame de Pompadour, born Jeanne-Antoinette Poisson, was the official mistress of King Louis XV of France from 1745 until her death in 1764, exerting considerable influence at the court of Versailles during that time. However, her popularity and reception spanned a wide spectrum, ranging from admiration and praise to scorn and disdain. At court, Pompadour’s popularity was mixed, reflecting both the opportunities for intrigue and advancement she presented as well as resentment at her power and non-aristocratic roots. Among the Parisian populace, views on Pompadour were also diverse and shifting, encompassing everything from initial curiosity and praise of her fashionable style to later criticism of her lavish spending during times of economic hardship.

At the court of Versailles, Pompadour’s popularity was polarized and complex. On the one hand, many courtiers sought to gain her favor to advance their own ambitions, as she possessed considerable influence over access to the king, government appointments, and other privileges. This faction flattered and praised Pompadour in order gain her patronage. On the other hand, many at court resented Pompadour’s power and non-aristocratic background. They looked down upon her bourgeois origins and snidely referred to her as “Jeanne Antoinette” rather than by her title as Marquise. They spread gossip about her relationship with the king and sought to turn public opinion against her.  

The Parisian public, like the court, was also divided in their views on Pompadour. When she first became the king’s mistress, the public was curious about this charming and fashionable woman. Her beauty, wit, and style were praised, and she came to influence trends in art, decoration, and design. However, as her lavish spending and art acquisitions continued against the backdrop of high taxes, food shortages, and a disastrous defeat in the Seven Years’ War, public opinion turned sharply against her. Pamphlets circulated attacking her greed, corruption, and manipulation of the king. By the end of her life, she had become a scapegoat for the nation’s woes.

In conclusion, Madame de Pompadour’s popularity during her long reign as Louis XV’s mistress varied greatly among both the court at Versailles and the Parisian public. At court, she gained both devoted patrons and resentful enemies, as courtiers sought to exploit her influence or undermine her power. Among ordinary Parisians, views ranged from initial admiration of her style and curiosity to later disdain for her lavish spending during times of hardship. Pompadour was a complex and polarizing figure who, for better or worse, came to personify the excesses of the French court in the mid-18th century. Overall, while she maintained some supporters until her death, her popularity declined significantly over time at both Versailles and in Paris.
