The presence of others can have a significant impact on an individual's performance, decision making, and behavior. This phenomenon is known as social facilitation, and it has been studied by psychologists for over a century. Norman Triplett conducted one of the first studies on social facilitation in 1898, finding that the presence of others improved the performance of cyclists. Since then, research on social facilitation has blossomed, and several theories have emerged to explain the effect.   

Triplett noticed that the times of cyclists competing together were faster than when they rode alone. He theorized that the presence of others aroused a competitive instinct that enhanced performance. Subsequent research supported Triplett's findings and the notion that an audience can improve performance, especially on well-learned or simple tasks. However, the presence of others may worsen performance on complex or unfamiliar tasks due to distraction, evaluation apprehension, or other factors. This pattern of results gave rise to drive theory, which proposes that the presence of others induces arousal and directs attention in ways that can either improve or worsen performance depending on the nature and difficulty of the task.

Further research has supported drive theory but also pointed to more nuanced explanations for social facilitation effects. Evaluation apprehension theory suggests that the presence of others evokes social anxiety arising from concerns about how one's performance will be judged or perceived. This anxiety motivates the individual to perform in a manner that elicits a positive evaluation. However, too much anxiety can have the opposite effect and debilitate performance by diverting attention and mental resources.

Another perspective is distraction-conflict theory, which proposes that the presence of others divides attention between the focal task and processing information related to the audience. This can enhance simple or well-learned tasks by increasing general arousal but worsen complex tasks by overloading mental resources. Support for this theory comes from studies showing that reducing distraction and ambiguity regarding the audience's expectations can attenuate and sometimes reverse social facilitation effects.

In conclusion, research on how the presence of others influences individuals has revealed a complex set of causes and effects. While Triplett identified a basic drive for competition and social comparison, subsequent theories like drive theory, evaluation apprehension, and distraction-conflict theory provide more nuanced explanations that account for both facilitating and debilitating impacts of an audience on performance and behavior. The study of social facilitation over the last century has yielded many insights into human motivation, emotion, cognition, and interpersonal dynamics. Overall, the presence of others is a powerful force that continues to shape human activity in group settings.
