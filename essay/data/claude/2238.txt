The Bohr model of the atom was proposed by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr in 1913. It depicts the atom as a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons that travel in circular orbits around the nucleus, similar to the planets orbiting the sun. The model was an early quantum theory of the atom that incorporated the idea of quantization of energy levels for electron orbits. Though the Bohr model has since been superseded by more accurate models of atomic structure, it remains historically significant as one of the foundational theories of the quantum atom.    

The key ideas in the Bohr model are quantization of energy and discrete electron orbits. Bohr postulated that electrons can only occupy certain discrete orbits around the nucleus. Each orbit corresponds to a specific energy level. Electrons can jump between these energy levels, absorbing or emitting specific amounts of energy that correspond to the energy difference between the levels. The electrons remain in a steady state within each orbital, and do not spiral into the nucleus as classical theory would predict. The Bohr model was thus able to explain phenomena like atomic spectra that classical theory could not. 

The Bohr model successfully explains several experimental observations of atoms. It can predict the allowed spectral lines of atoms like hydrogen, correctly calculating the frequencies of light that can be emitted or absorbed. The model also explains why atoms do not collapse - the electrons stay in their fixed orbits and do not radiate energy. The Bohr model provided the first insights into how quantum theory can apply at the level of atoms and electrons. It demonstrated that classical physics alone could not explain atomic phenomena. 

However, the Bohr model is limited and fundamentally flawed. It can only be applied exactly to hydrogen-like atoms and ions, and fails to predict spectral lines for multi-electron atoms accurately. It does not incorporate the uncertainty principle or electron spin. The model depicts electrons as particles orbiting the nucleus in a classical sense, contrary to the understanding provided by quantum mechanics that electrons behave as waves. The Bohr model has been replaced by the quantum mechanical model of the atom, in which electrons occupy probability clouds and orbitals rather than fixed orbits.

While the Bohr model is now obsolete as a physical theory, it remains significant historically and pedagogically. It represents an important step toward a full quantum theory of the atom. The Bohr model introduced revolutionary ideas that overturned prevailing classical theories of atoms, even if in an imperfect way. It remains commonly taught as an introduction to quantum concepts before students move on to the more accurate quantum mechanical model. The Bohr model will be remembered as a pioneering step on the path to modern physics.
