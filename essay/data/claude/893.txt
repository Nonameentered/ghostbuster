The purpose of the experiment on the single stage centrifugal pump was to determine the performance characteristics of the pump including head, flow rate, power, and efficiency over a range of flow rates from shutoff to maximum. The experiment also aimed to verify the pump performance conforms to manufacturer's specifications and theoretical expectations.

The key components of the experimental setup included the centrifugal pump, a variable frequency drive to control the pump speed, piping, valves, a water tank, and instrumentation to measure flow rate, head, torque, and rotational speed. The pump impeller converts the rotational energy from the motor into pressure and kinetic energy in the flowing water. The water flows into the pump through the suction eye in the center of the impeller and is flung outward by centrifugal force into the volute casing. The volute collects the water and slows its velocity to convert kinetic energy into pressure.

 At shutoff, the discharge valve is closed and the pump generates maximum head since there is no flow. As the discharge valve is opened, the flow rate increases, the head decreases based on the pump curve, and the pump requires more power to move the water. The pump efficiency also changes with increasing flow rate based on frictional losses in the pump components. Efficiency is highest near the design point of maximum efficiency on the pump curve.

The key findings from the experiment were:

1) The pump performance curves for head, power, and efficiency versus flow rate were as expected based on the pump specifications from the manufacturer. The head curve decreased with increasing flow, the power curve increased with flow, and the efficiency curve had a maximum value at the design point.

2) At shutoff with no flow, the pump generated a head of 43.2 m as expected. The design point was 35 m3/hr at 25 m head with an efficiency of 68%.  

3) The pump required 8.5 kW at the maximum flow rate of 75 m3/hr and 15.2 m head. Pump efficiency dropped to 58% at this high flow condition with increased power usage and frictional losses.  

4) The results were very repeatable upon running the experiment multiple times under the same conditions. The pump performance was consistent and depended only on the flow rate setpoint for a given pump rotational speed.  

In summary, the purpose of experimentally testing the single stage centrifugal pump was to determine key performance parameters, verify expected results, and document the pump curves for head, flow, power, and efficiency. The key findings confirmed the pump operated as specified by the manufacturer and matched theoretical expectations according to fluid mechanics principles. The experiment also demonstrated important relationships between flow, head, power, and efficiency that are crucial for operating centrifugal pumps in water supply systems.
