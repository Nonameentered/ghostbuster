Here is a draft 1256-word essay in response to the prompt:

There are several theoretical approaches to analyzing tense in English grammar. The three main perspectives are the traditional, structural, and generative approaches. These approaches differ significantly in their view on the existence and definition of the future tense in English.

The traditional approach takes a descriptive view of tense and considers the future tense to be primarily expressed morphologically using the modal 'will' plus a bare infinitive verb. For example, "I will go" is in the future tense. This approach defines tense strictly in terms of verb morphology and considers the future tense to be as real as the past and present tenses. However, it does not account for the fact that English speakers also commonly use present tense forms to refer to future time, as in "I go tomorrow." It relies too heavily on inflectional morphology and does not fully capture the relationship between tense and time in English.

The structural approach rejects the traditional view and argues that there are no tense distinctions in English and only a single tenseless form - the bare infinitive. Tense is determined solely by temporal adverbials and temporal context. So in "I go tomorrow," 'go' is a tenseless verb and 'tomorrow' provides the future time reference. This approach has significant merits, as English does rely heavily on adverbials for time reference. However, it fails to account for clear tense distinctions in verb morphology, as in the contrast between "I go" in the present and "I went" in the past.

The generative approach argues that tense is located in the deep rather than surface structure of English. At the surface level, there are variations in verb morphology and temporal adverbials that convey time reference. But these map onto an underlying 'tense node' in the syntax that locates situations in time relative to the utterance. This approach allows for variation in how future time is expressed while still positing an underlying future tense category. For example, both "I will go" and "I go tomorrow" tap into the same future tense node, even though their surface forms differ. This generative view of the future tense as part of the deep structure seems most able to reconcile the demands of the temporal semantics of English with the variable morphosyntactic resources it uses to convey those semantics. 

In everyday language, there are significant implications when it comes to how we actually conceive of and employ the future tense. The traditional view implies we should primarily rely on the 'will + verb' construction, but this is an overly narrow take on how future meaning is achieved in natural language. The structural view suggests we can disregard tense altogether, but this does not align with our intuitive sense that verbs like 'will go' locate situations in future time in a way 'go' alone does not. The generative perspective - that there is an underlying future tense category that can be expressed in various ways - most closely matches our implicit mental grammar of tense and how we actually use language to talk about the future in everyday life.
