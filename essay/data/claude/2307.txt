Colorectal cancer arises through the accumulation of sporadic mutations in key genes that regulate cell growth and division. The three main signaling pathways involved in colorectal cancer are the Wnt pathway, the Ras/MAPK pathway, and the PI3K/PKB pathway. Mutations in these pathways disrupt normal cell signaling and confer a survival advantage to tumor cells, allowing them to proliferate unchecked.

The Wnt signaling pathway regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. In normal cells, the protein APC inhibits the Wnt pathway. However, in colorectal cancer cells, mutations in the APC gene lead to loss of function, causing uncontrolled Wnt signaling. The most common mutations in colorectal cancer are found in the APC gene. Loss of APC function leads to accumulation of β-catenin, which activates genes that promote cell growth and division. Unregulated Wnt signaling due to APC loss of function is found in up to 80% of colorectal cancer cases.

The Ras/MAPK pathway also regulates cell proliferation and differentiation. Mutations in K-Ras, an upstream activator of this pathway, are found in 40-50% of colorectal cancers. These mutations lead to constitutive activation of the Ras protein, which activates the MAPK pathway. Overactive Ras/MAPK signaling promotes cell growth and division. Mutated K-Ras is an early event in colorectal tumorigenesis and also contributes to metastasis.  

The PI3K/PKB pathway regulates cell growth and survival. Mutations in PIK3CA, the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K, are found in 10-15% of colorectal cancers. These mutations lead to increased PI3K activity, which activates PKB/Akt. Overactive PI3K/PKB signaling promotes cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Mutations in B-Raf, a protein kinase in the MAPK pathway, are also found in approximately 10% of colorectal cancers. B-Raf mutations lead to constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, promoting cell growth and division.

In summary, colorectal cancer arises through sporadic mutations that disrupt three major signaling pathways: Wnt, Ras/MAPK, and PI3K/PKB. Loss of APC function leads to uncontrolled Wnt signaling, promoting cell growth and proliferation. Mutations in K-Ras and B-Raf lead to overactivation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, also promoting cell growth and division. Mutations in PIK3CA activate the PI3K/PKB pathway, promoting cell growth, proliferation and survival. These mutations confer a survival advantage to colorectal cancer cells, allowing them to proliferate unchecked and form tumors. Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind colorectal cancer development will help identify new therapeutic targets and improve treatment strategies.
