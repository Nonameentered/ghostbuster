Marginal costing and full costing are two different methods of accounting for costs and determining operating profits. Marginal costing considers only the direct and variable costs of production, whereas full costing also allocates fixed overhead costs to units produced. 

Marginal costing determines operating profit based on the difference between sales revenue and variable costs. Fixed costs are excluded. In full costing, both variable and fixed costs are considered to determine operating profit. Therefore, operating profits calculated using marginal costing will be higher than full costing, all else being equal.

The choice of costing method can significantly impact profitability analysis and decision making. To illustrate, consider a scenario where a company can take an additional order that requires incurring variable costs of $50,000. Under marginal costing, as long as the sales revenue from the extra order exceeds $50,000, it should be accepted because there is a positive contribution margin. However, under full costing, if accepting the extra order requires incurring additional fixed overhead costs of $30,000, then the total costs are $80,000. Unless the sales revenue is higher than $80,000, accepting the order will reduce operating profits. 

Another scenario could be analyzing the impact of a sales price decrease. Under marginal costing, as long as the new price covers the variable costs, it should have no impact on operating profits. But under full costing, a price drop also needs to cover the allocated fixed costs to maintain the same operating profits. If not, a price decrease will negatively impact operating profits.

In conclusion, while marginal costing considers variable costs alone and can be simpler to apply, full costing provides a more comprehensive view of the costs involved in production and a more accurate operating profit figure. For long-term strategic decisions, full costing is generally a superior method. But for short-term decisions involving incremental costs and revenues, marginal costing offers useful insights. Neither method is absolutely better - the choice depends on the circumstances and the specific managerial decision needs. With a balanced application of both marginal and full costing, managers get the benefits of each costing method.
