Here is a draft 2250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Parmenides, the ancient Greek philosopher of Elea, presented two contrasting notions of reality in his poem "On Nature": the Way of Truth and the Way of Seeming. The Way of Truth presents a vision of absolute, unchanging Being, while the Way of Seeming describes the shifting, illusory world of everyday experience. At first glance, these two "ways" appear contradictory and irreconcilable. However, upon closer examination, Parmenides' poem suggests that the two ways in fact support and rely upon each other to present a coherent view of reality as it truly is and as it appears to humans.  

The Way of Truth describes reality as singular, eternal, and unchanging. Parmenides argues that "it is, and that it is not possible for it not to be" (Frag. 2). There can be no coming into being or perishing, no division or multiplicity, and no change or motion in true reality. All is one homogeneous, motionless sphere of Being. This is Parmenides' vision of the absolute, transcendent truth that lies beneath the illusion of the physical world. The attributes of the Way of Truth stand in stark contrast with the world of human experience, which is characterized by change, diversity, motion, and impermanence.

The Way of Seeming, on the other hand, describes the realm of human experience and perception. In this "way," Parmenides presents a cosmology and theory of the natural world as a "deceitful ordering of my verses so that the norm of credibility may lead you to believe" (Frag. 1.29-31). While the Way of Seeming portrays a false and illusory world, according to Parmenides it alone can explain the cosmos as humans observe and experience it, with its shifting shapes and forms. The world we inhabit is mere "seeming," but it is a necessary seeming - it is the only way in which absolute Being can be apprehended by mortal minds.

The two ways are thus co-dependent in Parmenides' poem. The unchanging reality described in the Way of Truth grounds the illusory world of the Way of Seeming, while the Way of Seeming provides the only means by which humans can grasp and understand the ultimate truth of Being. Each way relies on the other to present a complete vision of reality. Without the absolute, unchanging Being of the Way of Truth, the world of the Way of Seeming would be utterly without foundation or anchor. But without the Way of Seeming, the Way of Truth risks being empty and meaningless, as it would refer to a reality completely cut off from human understanding.

In conclusion, while Parmenides' poem presents two seemingly irreconcilable ways of understanding reality, a closer reading reveals that the Way of Truth and the Way of Seeming in fact depend upon and give meaning to each other. The unchanging truth grounds the illusory world of human experience, which in turn provides the only means by which absolute Being can be grasped. Through this relationship of co-dependence, Parmenides achieves in his poem a complete vision of reality as it is and as it appears.
