Here is a 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Is Logic a Man-Made Construct or a Feature of the Physical World?

Logic refers to the rules of inference and reasoning that allow us to determine whether arguments are valid or invalid, and whether conclusions follow from a set of premises. There is an ongoing debate about whether these rules of logic are man-made constructs or whether they are features of the physical world that we discover. Three philosophers who have written on this topic and taken different views are Lewis Carroll, W.V.O. Quine, and Susan Haack. 

Lewis Carroll articulated the view that logical rules are man-made in his 1896 paper “What the Tortoise Said to Achilles.” In the paper, Carroll shows through a dialogue that accepting logical rules requires a series of separate acts of acceptance for each rule and each logical inference. The rules of logic themselves cannot compel their own acceptance, so we must choose to accept them. This supports the view that logical rules are constructs created by humans, not features of the world we discover.

Quine took the opposite view that logical rules reflect features of the world. In his 1951 essay “Two Dogmas of Empiricism,” Quine argues that logical rules are revisable in the same way as scientific theories. We can revise logical rules in the face of experience that does not match what the rules predict. This suggests logical rules describe the world, rather than being human constructs, because we can refine and improve them based on empirical evidence. However, Quine still maintains that logical rules are underdetermined by experience, so there is an element of human choice involved in adopting one logic over another.

Haack argues for a middle ground between the viewpoints of Carroll and Quine. In her 1976 book Philosophy of Logics, Haack claims that while logical rules are not simply waiting to be discovered in the world as platonic entities, neither are they unrestrained human constructs. Logical rules have a basis in “the logic of language” and “the logic of common sense.” The capacity for logical reasoning evolved as an adaptation that allows humans to survive and flourish. So the rules of logic have a biological and cultural basis, even as they go beyond what is biologically or culturally determined. Logical rules can be revised, but only in a gradual way that builds on what came before.

In assessing these viewpoints, a key question is whether logical rules are revisable or not. If they are entirely man-made, as Carroll suggests, they should be freely revisable. But if they reflect the world, as Quine proposes, revisions to logic may prove incompatible with how the world works. Haack’s perspective that logical rules have a biological and cultural basis, but still go beyond what is determined in those domains, provides a plausible account for how logical rules can be open to gradual revision and refinement, while still corresponding with the world. Overall, the debate around logic's status remains open, but a synthesis of the viewpoints expressed by Carroll, Quine, and Haack suggests logical rules have both man-made and world-reflecting aspects.
