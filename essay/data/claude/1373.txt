Non-violent alternative globalization movements and civil society organizations from the Global South have the potential to transform international systems and norms in significant ways. However, they often face significant barriers and obstacles in challenging deeply embedded structures of power. Still, their efforts highlight the need to reimagine international law and policymaking to be more inclusive, participatory and responsive to marginalized groups and communities around the world.  

These alternative globalization movements, referred to here as AGMs, have several key benefits as social movements. First, they broaden participation in global debates by bringing more voices and perspectives to the table, especially those of marginalized groups in developing countries. Mainstream intergovernmental organizations like the UN have long been criticized as elite institutions that primarily reflect the interests and priorities of powerful nations. AGMs help counter this imbalance by advocating for issues that matter most to ordinary people and communities in the Global South. For instance, La Via Campesina, an international peasant movement, has campaigned for years on issues like food sovereignty, agrarian reform, and rights for small farmers who are often left out of agricultural policymaking. 

Second, AGMs promote more decentralized and grassroots forms of global cooperation. They are horizontal networks that connect local groups and build solidarity across borders, rather than top-down institutions. This grassroots globalization from below provides an alternative to neoliberal globalization driven by corporate interests. It gives more agency and power to local communities in shaping processes of global integration that affect them. As an example, the World Social Forum served as an open space for civil society groups to come together, build connections, and articulate a vision for a more just world order.

Third, AGMs foster new ideas about human rights and global governance that challenge dominant assumptions. They campaign for recognition of new rights, like the right to water, as well as greater protections for marginalized groups such as peasants, indigenous peoples and migrants. They advocate for new models of global governance that are more democratic, participatory and accountable to citizens. For instance, global campaigns for water justice and agrarian reform have sought to frame access to water and food as human rights issues, pushing back against the marketization of essential resources. Debates around the post-2015 development agenda and Sustainable Development Goals were also shaped by civil society activism demanding rights to sustainable development and participation.

However, despite these benefits, AGMs face considerable barriers to significantly transforming international law and policy. Global governance institutions remain primarily inter-state systems, and states are often reluctant to shift more power to non-state actors. Corporations and other entrenched interests also work to counter the agendas of activist movements. The organizations that make up AGMs vary widely in size, resources and capacity, limiting their impact. And while social media has enabled new forms of transnational activism, it is also easier for governments and others to monitor, censor and clamp down on dissent.

Overall, AGMs highlight the need for international law and institutions to become more participatory, democratic and responsive to marginalized groups, but also the challenges of achieving this vision. Their grassroots strategies of awareness raising, mobilization, and network building to advance alternative policy agendas offer valuable lessons for enhancing the effectiveness of civil society activism directed at any levelâ€”local, national or international. By bringing more voices into global debates and governance, promoting decentralized cooperation, and articulating new rights and models of global governance, AGMs are working to build a more just, equitable and sustainable world order. However, supportive policy and legal frameworks, as well as shifts in power, will be needed for them to fulfill their transformative potential.
