R. David's article 'Rationality versus Irrationality in Egyptian Medicine in the Pharaonic and Graeco-Roman Periods' presents a flawed historical argument due to several shortcomings that impact the representation of Egyptian and Greek medical practices.  

Firstly, the article presents a false dichotomy between 'rational' Greek medicine and 'irrational' Egyptian medicine. This is an oversimplification that fails to capture the nuances of both medical systems. Egyptian medicine incorporated elements of magic and religion, but was not purely 'irrational' - it was a coherent body of knowledge based on practical experience. Greek humoral theory and practices were also not entirely 'rational' in the modern scientific sense. Both systems blended physical examination and interventions with spiritual and mystical elements in ways consistent with their cultural contexts. By framing them as polar opposites, the article obscures the complex realities of how these medical systems functioned.

Secondly, the article fails to account for continuities between Egyptian and Greek medicine. Although the theory and practices changed significantly over time, Greek physicians still borrowed diagnostic techniques, pharmaceutical knowledge, and other elements from Egyptian precursors. For example, Dioscorides' De Materia Medica incorporated information from the Ebers Papyrus, showing the influence of Egyptian herbal knowledge. The Greeks adopted, adapted and improved upon Egyptian medical concepts and practices - they did not simply replace them. The article overlooks these ongoing connections, again pitching the relationship as one of outright opposition rather than cultural exchange or synthesis.  

Thirdly, the article relies on a problematic assumption that 'rationality' and 'scientificity' are objective and universal measures of a medical system's worth. In fact, these qualities depend heavily on cultural context. A medical practice that seems fanciful or illogical in one cultural milieu may be perfectly sensible in another if it aligns with their understandings of how the human body works and what constitutes proof or efficacy. The article implicitly frames Greek medicine as inherently more advanced and valuable because of its ostensible rationalism, an ethnocentric bias that lacks consideration for how Egyptians themselves viewed and valued their own medical knowledge.   

In summary, R. David's article presents a series of flawed historical arguments that offer a simplistic contrast between Egyptian and Greek medicine in ancient times. A more nuanced perspective acknowledges that these medical systems were both complex cultural phenomena with elements of continuity as well as change between them. By eschewing binaries and allowing for cultural plurality in how we evaluate medicine, we can gain deeper insight into the evolution of knowledge and practice across distinct societies and time periods. The flaws in the article ultimately stem from a rigid insistence on measuring Egyptian and Greek medicine against modern criteria of rationality, rather than understanding them on their own terms as products of the cultures that produced them.  Overall, these issues significantly impact how Egyptian and Greek medical traditions are represented to readers, in ways that are reductive and historically problematic.
