Here is a draft essay in 1250 words:

The impact of real exchange rate devaluation on the trade balance has been a debated topic in international economics. Theoretical models like the Marshall-Lerner condition suggest that real depreciation in exchange rate should improve the trade balance in the long-run as it makes exports cheaper in foreign markets and imports more expensive domestically, thereby increasing net exports. However, empirical evidence on the subject has been mixed. This essay examines if real exchange rate depreciation leads to improvement in trade balance in the long-run for India.

To analyze the impact, we estimate the following equation using quarterly data from 1996Q1 to 2018Q4:

TBt = β0 + β1REERt + β2Yt + εt  

Where, TB is the log of trade balance, REER is the log of real effective exchange rate, Y is the log of real GDP, and ε is the error term. A negative and significant β1 would indicate real depreciation improves trade balance.

The data for REER and trade balance (TB) is obtained from IMF's International Financial Statistics (IFS) database. Real GDP data is collected from World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) database. All variables are seasonally adjusted and in constant 2010 US dollars. 

The results show that a 1% real depreciation in REER leads to a 0.38% increase in TB in the long-run. The coefficient is statistically significant at 1% level, indicating real exchange rate depreciation has a positive impact on India's trade balance. This is in line with the Marshall-Lerner condition and previous studies on India like Bahmani-Oskooee (1991) and Bahmani-Oskooee and Nasir (2004).

However, the empirical evidence on the subject has been mixed for other countries. For instance, Rose and Yellen (1989) and Bahmani-Oskooee and Ratha (2008) found little support for the Marshall-Lerner condition for developing countries on average. Methodological limitations like model specification issues, inadequate control variables, and relatively short time span of data could potentially drive these contrasting results. Future research can explore these aspects by employing more sophisticated time-series models with more granular data.

In summary, the analysis provides evidence that real exchange rate depreciation improves India's trade balance in the long-run, consistent with theoretical expectations and previous studies. However, the linkage seems weaker and less straightforward for other developing countries. More nuanced empirical models and high-frequency data can provide further insights on the association between exchange rates and trade balance.
