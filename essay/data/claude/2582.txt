Here is a draft 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

Industrial refrigeration refers to the large-scale cooling process used primarily for food preservation and storage. It allows perishable foods such as meats, seafood, dairy, and produce to be stored for long periods while maintaining quality and safety. The core principle behind industrial refrigeration is using mechanical equipment to continually extract heat from an insulated space. 

The first stage in industrial refrigeration is the pre-cooling or chilling stage. Large refrigeration units are used to rapidly lower the temperature of the food to between 32 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit, depending on the type of food. For example, meat and poultry are chilled to 40 F, while fish and seafood are chilled to 32 F. Pre-cooling slows the growth of bacteria and allows the food to be further processed or packaged.

The second stage is freezing, where the food is cooled to 0 F or below. At these sub-freezing temperatures, any remaining liquid in the food forms small ice crystals. These crystals halt microbial growth and enzymatic activity that can lead to spoilage. The speed of freezing is important to produce smaller ice crystals, which minimize damage to cell structures. Faster freezing using blast chillers can freeze food within a few hours. Slower freezing in plate freezers may take days. 

For vegetables, an additional pre-treatment step called blanching is commonly used prior to freezing. Blanching involves quickly heating the vegetables in boiling water or steam, then quickly chilling them. Blanching destroys enzymes that can cause loss of flavor, color and texture during freezing. It also removes any trapped air from the vegetable tissues. Vegetables that are properly blanched will show signs such as a bright color, limp and pliable texture, and will not turn brown when cut. After blanching, the vegetables are ready to be frozen, either individually or in a freezer bag or container.

In summary, industrial refrigeration uses mechanical equipment to quickly chill and freeze perishable foods on a large scale. The core stages are pre-cooling, freezing, and for some foods blanching. When done properly under sanitary conditions, industrial refrigeration allows foods to be preserved for months while retaining maximum quality in terms of nutrition, taste, texture and appearance. Overall, refrigeration technology has revolutionized the modern food system by making a wide range of foods available year-round.
