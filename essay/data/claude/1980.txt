Farm diversification refers to farmers expanding into non-traditional areas to generate additional revenue and maximize the use of farm resources. Some common forms of farm diversification include agri-tourism, on-farm retail stores, and diversifying into non-agricultural enterprises. One viable option for farm diversification is offering livery services, such as horse boarding, training, and riding lessons. 

To diversify into livery services, farmers must first conduct thorough market research to determine the demand for such services in their local area and the types of facilities and services that are most needed. Location plays an important role, as livery services will be more successful if located within a reasonable distance of potential clients. Farmers should consider proximity to residential areas, transportation routes, and other equine facilities. Facilities are also a key consideration, as high-quality, purpose-built stables and riding arenas will be expected by most clients.

Market research should focus on the number of horse owners and equine enthusiasts in the local area, the types of livery services currently offered and where there may be gaps, and prices charged for various services. Surveys, focus groups, and competitive analysis can help determine potential demand and appropriate pricing. The livery offerings should match what is most needed in the local market. Some options include:

- DIY livery (self-serve stabling), full livery (all services provided), or part livery (some services provided).

- Stabling and turnout only or additional services like feeding, mucking out, grooming, or exercising horses.

- Training and coaching for various riding disciplines. Group or private lessons for all levels of riders.

- Breeding services in addition to boarding and training.

Location is key, as transporting horses regularly over long distances can be stressful for the animals and time-consuming for owners. Easy access via major roads is also important. Existing equestrian properties may have an advantage, as the facilities and access to trails or riding areas are already in place. The quality and types of facilities and accommodation must also match the proposed livery offerings. Full livery in particular will require well-designed stables, spacious stalls, quality feed storage, grooming and medical treatment areas, turnout paddocks, and riding accommodations.

In summary, diversifying into livery services can be an excellent option for farmers looking to generate additional revenue from their land and resources. However, careful planning is required to determine the right mix of services for the local market, find a suitable location, and invest in appropriate facilities. Conducting thorough market research and business planning will help ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the livery enterprise.
