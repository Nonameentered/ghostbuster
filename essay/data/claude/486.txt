Transnational actors, including multinational corporations (MNCs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), religious groups, and criminal organizations, have gained greater influence in the globalized world. They have challenged the traditional notions of state sovereignty and control, both intentionally and unintentionally through their global operations and networks. While states remain the dominant actors in international relations, transnational actors are shaping global politics in new and consequential ways.

MNCs have become powerful actors on the global stage through their cross-border trade, investments, and supply chains. They seek to maximize profits and expand globally, not tied to any particular nation-state. MNCs lobby governments and international organizations to create laws, trade deals, and regulations favorable to their interests. They can threaten to move jobs and investments to force policy changes. In some cases, MNCs have economic power that rivals nation-states. They are determining global economic flows and reshaping national economies in the process.

NGOs have also gained more international prominence, advocating for human rights, environmental protection, public health, and other causes that transcend national boundaries. NGOs lobby governments and international organizations to advance their goals. They can shame and vilify countries that violate international norms. NGOs organize global campaigns and protests to raise awareness and spur action on issues like climate change, LGBTQ rights, and humanitarian crises. While NGOs lack governing authority, they are influencing global public opinion and politics. 

Religious groups are also acting globally, funding missions, education, healthcare, and humanitarian work around the world. Some religious groups aim to spread their faith and values across borders. They lobby governments on social policies like abortion, LGBTQ rights, and family issues. In areas where the state has limited control or legitimacy, religious groups provide services and governance. Some extreme religious groups also carry out violent attacks against those they see as infidels, directly threatening global security.

Criminal organizations have built global networks for smuggling weapons, drugs, wildlife, and people across borders. They exploit gaps in governance and weak states to build their criminal empires. These vast illicit flows undermine state authority and the rule of law. Criminal groups violently eliminate those who pose threats to their criminal activities, including government officials, journalists, and civilians. They pose serious threats to security and governance from below.

In conclusion, transnational actors are reshaping international relations in complex ways. They provide both opportunities and challenges to state sovereignty and global governance. There is no simple or single response. States need to find ways to cooperate and coordinate with responsible transnational actors, like some NGOs and MNCs, while also strengthening governance and security to counter threats from extreme religious groups, criminal organizations, and other malicious non-state actors. The dynamics between states and transnational actors will shape global politics for years to come.
