The experiment studied the kinetics of the reaction catalyzed by alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphate esters in an alkaline pH environment. The experiment aimed to determine the kinetic parameters Km and Vmax for the enzyme. 

To determine these parameters, the initial reaction velocity (Vo) was measured for a range of substrate concentrations [S] while keeping the enzyme concentration constant. Vo was calculated from the initial linear portion of the product concentration [P] vs. time curve for each substrate concentration. A Michaelis-Menten curve of Vo vs. [S] was then plotted, and Km and Vmax were determined.

Km, the Michaelis constant, indicates the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of Vmax. A low Km means high enzyme affinity for the substrate, while a high Km means low affinity. Vmax is the maximum reaction velocity achieved by the system, when the enzyme active sites are saturated with substrate.

For the experiment, Vo was measured for substrate concentrations of 0.5 mM, 1.0 mM, 1.5 mM, 2.0 mM, and 2.5 mM. The data showed that Vo increased with increasing [S] until plateauing at higher [S]. Fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation gave a Km of 0.75 mM and a Vmax of 0.45 μM/min. 

These results indicate the alkaline phosphatase enzyme has a moderate affinity for the substrate, since Km is in the millimolar range. The saturation of Vo at higher [S] shows the limited activity of the enzyme due to a finite number of active sites. The finding of a finite Vmax is consistent with the idea that enzyme reactions are catalytic rather than stoichiometric. 

In summary, the kinetics experiment found a Km of 0.75 mM and a Vmax of 0.45 μM/min for the alkaline phosphatase enzyme. These parameters were obtained by measuring the initial reaction velocity at different substrate concentrations and analyzing the data with the Michaelis-Menten model of enzyme kinetics. The results provide a quantitative framework for understanding the catalytic activity of alkaline phosphatase.
