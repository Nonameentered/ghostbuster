Here is a 1000 word essay in response to the prompt:

The title of Kit Wright's poem "The Magic Box" is a crucial element in setting up the theme of magic and imagination that permeates the work. A "magic box" refers to something mysterious and wondrous that evokes a sense of imagination and possibility. The contents of such a box could contain anything fantastical or enchanted. 

The poem reinforces this sense of magic and imagination in its first lines: "Inside the magic box / are sun, moon and stars, / and a red bird singing." These celestial and natural images immediately transport the reader to a realm of fantasy and wonder.  The red bird's singing adds a whimsical musical element that enhances the poem's magical mood.

The structure and form of the poem also contribute to the impression of imagination. The short four line stanzas resemble little containers or boxes themselves, as if each stanza holds a new magical item or wonder. For example, the second stanza introduces "a sea with a white ship sailing,  / and over the hills, an old wind wailing." These romantic sea and wind images evoke mystery and adventure in the reader's mind.

The third stanza intensifies the fantastical feeling with its "forest of rustling trees,  / and a pool in a glade that nobody sees." The hidden, secretive pool surrounded by trees gives a fairytale-like quality to the poem. The repetition of "and" at the start of each line in the stanzas has an accumulative effect, as if each new image or magical wonder is being added to an ever-expanding scope of possibility inside the box.

The poem culminates in a cascade of striking and fantastical images in the final stanza: "a castle with lords and ladies fair, / and a dragon and griffin in the air. / There are treasures and crowns and all things fine,  / in this little box of mine." The grand castle, mythical beasts, treasures and crowns signify the poem's complete immersion into a magical realm of fantasy. The possessive "my little box" also gives the sense that the poet - and by extension the reader - has an intimate connection and control over this miniature world of wonders.

In conclusion, the title "The Magic Box" signifies and introduces the main theme of imagination in the poem. The short stanza structure resembles little boxes holding magical images and the repetition of "and" gives a feeling of accumulating wonder and possibility. The striking fantastical imagery, especially in the final stanza, transports the reader into a fairytale realm of mystery, adventure and imagination. All these elements combine to create an overall whimsical impression of childhood fantasy and the power of the imagination.
