Here is a draft essay of around 1500 words on the Standard Model, its challenges, and String Theory:

The Standard Model of particle physics is the most comprehensive model describing all the fundamental building blocks of matter in the universe. It describes the basic particles in the universe, called fermions, and the forces acting between them through the exchange of bosons. The fermions include the quarks and leptons, as well as their antiparticles. The quarks make up protons and neutrons, which in turn make up the nuclei of atoms. The leptons include electrons and neutrinos. The four fundamental forces, explained by the exchange of bosons, are the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force, the strong nuclear force, and gravity. 

While hugely successful, the Standard Model has several challenges and limitations. First, it does not incorporate the force of gravity and Einstein's theory of general relativity. It is not yet understood how to unify quantum mechanics, which governs the very small, and general relativity, which governs the very large. Second, the Standard Model has many free parameters, like particle masses and force strengths, that have to be determined experimentally rather than calculated from first principles. Third, the Standard Model does not explain dark matter and dark energy, which make up most of the universe. Fourth, the Standard Model predicts a unified force at high energies but does not describe how electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force unify into the electroweak force. Finally, the Standard Model does not incorporate a quantum theory of gravity.

String Theory aims to address many of these challenges and limitations of the Standard Model. In String Theory, the fundamental constituents of matter are not point particles but tiny vibrating strings. These strings vibrate in different ways, and each vibration corresponds to a different elementary particle like electrons, quarks, photons, and so on. So, all matter arises from the different vibrational states of fundamental strings. String Theory posits that there are 10 or 11 dimensions of space-time, most of which are invisible to us. It hypothesizes a unification of all forces, including gravity, by having them arise from the interactions of strings. 

String Theory offers an elegant framework to unify quantum mechanics and general relativity. It provides a potential quantum theory of gravity and a unification of all forces. However, String Theory faces its own challenges. It is not known if it corresponds to the real world at all - none of its predictions have been experimentally verified yet and it is unknown if they are even testable. String Theory also has too many possible solutions - there are many possible string theories and a need to determine which, if any, corresponds to our universe. While promising, String Theory remains a theoretical framework and still needs to overcome significant hurdles to be a viable theory of quantum gravity and unification in physics.
