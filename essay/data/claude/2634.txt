The interactional approach to sociolinguistics focuses on how individuals use language differently depending on the social context they are in. According to this approach, speech styles vary based on the environment and groups that individuals interact with, including whether those groups consist primarily of males, females or both. 

Research into male and female speech patterns has found that while there are some general tendencies, speech style is highly dependent on context.  For example, studies have shown that in single-gender groups, females tend to emphasize emotional supportiveness and rapport, using more features like hedging, questioning, and emotionally-oriented vocabulary. In contrast, single-gender male groups tend to focus more on dominance and status, using more assertive speech styles. However, these styles also depend on age, education level, and cultural factors. In mixed-gender groups, both men and women often adopt a more moderate speech style.

Two transcriptions that demonstrate how speech style alters based on context come from Tannen's research. The first is a conversation among three 10-year-old boys discussing their amusement park ride experience. Their speech is characterized by short exchanges, assertive statements, boasting about daring activities, and minimal hedging or emotion. This reinforces typical styles of male interaction emphasizing dominance. The second transcription is of three 10-year-old girls also discussing an amusement park ride. In contrast, their conversation is highly emotionally-focused, using many hedging phrases, questions, and emotive vocabulary to describe their experience. They express concern for each other and emphasize the interpersonal aspect of sharing the experience together. This interaction displays hallmarks of typical female interaction stressing emotional connection.

However, Tannen's research also found that in mixed-gender groups of children, speech style tended to become more moderate. Both males and females used more collaborative language and less extreme emotional or assertive styles. This shows that speech style is highly adaptable based on context and group. Research into adult male and female speech groups has found similar trends, though cultural, educational and age factors also mediate them.

In summary, the interactional approach suggests speech style changes based on social environment and group. While studies have identified some general tendencies in single-gender groups of males and females, speech is highly context-dependent. The transcriptions of groups of 10-year-old boys and girls reinforces literature on typical male and female speech styles, however, in mixed-gender groups speech style adapts to become more collaborative. Based on this, speech style cannot be defined by gender alone but is an extremely complex phenomenon. The interactional framework provides the needed nuance to explore the ways speech changes across different environments and social groups.
