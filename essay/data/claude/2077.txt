The spread plate and pour plate methods are two techniques for estimating total aerobic colony counts. The spread plate method involves spreading diluted samples across the surface of an agar plate using a glass spreader, while the pour plate method entails pouring diluted samples into molten agar in a Petri dish, which then solidifies. Both provide an estimate of the number of viable, aerobic microbes in a sample, reported as colony forming units per gram (cfu/g).  

There are advantages and disadvantages to each method. The spread plate technique typically yields higher colony counts since cells are not subjected to high temperatures during plating that could harm them. However, spread plates are more prone to uneven distribution of cells across the plate, requiring proper technique to obtain an accurate count. Pour plates have the benefits of efficient use of materials and ease of preparation but may give lower counts due to heat stress. 

Several factors affect the precision of colony counts for both methods. Proper dilution of the sample, accurate pipetting and spreading/pouring techniques, and choice of growth medium and incubation conditions are important. Environmental conditions like temperature can also influence growth and colony formation. Using duplicate plates for each dilution and taking the average count helps improve precision.   

Colony counts reported as cfu/g provide a more useful measurement than total viable counts. Cfu/g indicates the number of viable cells in a sample that are able to form colonies under the specific growth conditions used. Total viable counts may include viable but non-culturable cells that do not form colonies, leading to an overestimate. Cfu/g is a more realistic representation of the number of healthy, metabolically active cells in a sample that are capable of proliferation.

To confirm that colonies on Violet Red Bile Glucose Agar (VRBGA) are Enterobacteriaceae, typical colonies can be selected for further testing. Colonies that are red or pink in color, 2-3 mm in size, and either opaque or translucent are characteristic of this family. Additional biochemical tests that can be performed include checking for cytochrome oxidase negative results, and conducting indole, methyl red, Voges-Proskauer and citrate (IMViC) tests to determine the presence of enzymes specific to Enterobacteriaceae. Colonies testing positive with these supplementary tests can be confirmed as members of this bacterial family.

In summary, while spread plates and pour plates each have their advantages and limitations in estimating total aerobic colony counts, following proper techniques can yield precise results. Reporting counts as cfu/g provides a useful measure of healthy, active cells in a population. Biochemical and phenotypic tests can confirm that colonies growing on VRBGA belong to the Enterobacteriaceae family, indicating fecal contamination. With care and confirmation, these methods provide valuable tools for microbiological analysis.
