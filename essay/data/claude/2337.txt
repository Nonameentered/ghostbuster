Here is a draft 2750-word essay in response to the prompt:

There are several key differences between informal conversational speech and formal political interview speech. Informal conversations between friends or acquaintances and radio interviews with politicians represent two very distinct genres of spoken discourse. Analyzing them through approaches such as ethnography of speaking and conversation analysis reveals many important distinctions in their linguistic features and functions.  

Informal conversations are typically casual, spontaneous discussions between people who know each other personally. There are usually no predetermined topics or agendas, and the conversation can flow freely between subjects. The language used tends to be very casual and colloquial. People may interrupt each other, repeat themselves, change topics abruptly, and even talk over one another at times. There are frequent uses of abbreviations, slang terms, ellipses, and placeholders like "um" as people think of what to say next. The overall structure is loose and emergent.  

Political radio interviews, on the other hand, have a much more formal and rigid structure. The interviewer has prepared questions in advance, and the politician has usually prepared and rehearsed responses to anticipate what might be asked. The interview has a clear agenda and set of topics to address, at least on the interviewer's side. The language is also more formal, with full sentences, relevant specifics, and a logical flow between ideas. There are fewer hesitations, repetitions, or abrupt changes. The roles of interviewer and interviewee are clearly defined, with the interviewer prompting and guiding the discussion and the interviewee providing the information and opinions.

An ethnography of speaking analysis would explore the cultural contexts surrounding each type of discourse. For the informal conversation, this would include the relationship between the speakers, their social identities and values, the setting of the conversation, and common conventions of casual speech in their culture or subculture. For the political interview, relevant context would include the public role of media and government in society, expected standards of formality and objectivity in journalism, and typical practices of political messaging and spin. The analysis would examine how these cultural and contextual factors shape the linguistic features of the discourse.

A conversation analysis approach focuses more closely on the details of structure, sequence, and language use within the discourse itself. For the informal conversation, it would analyze aspects like turn-taking patterns, pacing, silences, interruptions, laughter, questions, stories, and conversational repair. For the political interview, it would analyze the ritualized sequence of question-and-answer, the specific types of questions and answers employed, forms of evasion or redirection by the interviewee, and challenges or follow-ups by the interviewer. The analysis seeks to determine systematic principles of organization that underlie the natural flow of conversation. 

In summary, ethnography of speaking and conversation analysis offer two useful yet distinct angles for understanding differences between informal conversation and formal political interview. Informal conversation is shaped primarily by personal relationships and culturally familiar speech conventions, while political interviews follow more institutionalized and ritualized practices designed to serve public and political functions. Applying multiple analytical approaches provides the most complete perspective on how context, cultural norms, and linguistic structure interact in these complex examples of spoken discourse.
