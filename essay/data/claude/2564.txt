Here is a draft 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

The study of language use in television advertisements relates closely to the field of linguistics, specifically the areas of discourse analysis, pragmatics, and sociolinguistics. The aim of analyzing language in TV ads is to understand how the linguistic features and choices, as well as the broader discourse, work to persuade the audience and sell the product or service. Common methods for such analysis include collecting transcripts of multiple ads in a campaign, coding and quantifying key linguistic elements like pronouns, modals, question types, and recording qualitative impressions.  

Some challenges in conducting this type of study include gaining access to full transcripts of ads, especially for recent or ongoing campaigns, as well as interpreting the intent and effect of linguistic features without additional context about the advertisers' strategies. These challenges can be addressed by directly contacting the advertising agencies to request transcripts when possible, and by analyzing multiple ads in a single campaign to identify patterns, with the understanding that there will still be some speculation involved regarding intent. Comparing results across multiple analysts can also help reduce subjective interpretations.

The results of these kinds of studies often align well with existing research on dialects, language attitudes, and persuasion. For example, research shows that certain pronouns like "you" and "your" can create a sense of personalization and motivate the audience by appealing to their self-interest. Studies also show how informal, colloquial language and specific word choices associated with friendliness and sincerity can positively impact audiences, while heavy use of modals like "should" and "must" can seem overly pushy. The use of questions, especially those with self-evident answers, is a well-documented persuasion tactic.  

When analyzed systematically, the language choices in TV commercials provide insight into wider sociolinguistic factors like language attitudes and processes of language change. For example, a rise in colloquial language and dialect leveling in some genres of ads could reflect a broader trend toward more casual and youthful styles of speech gaining mainstream acceptance and even prestige. Linguistic features common across cultures in international ad campaigns point to universal persuasive techniques and language forms that transcend differences in dialect and language. 

In summary, analyzing the language use in television ads through the lens of linguistics can yield valuable findings about persuasive tactics, language attitudes, and dialect trends. While there are challenges to conducting this research, comparing results across multiple studies and ads, requesting additional context from advertisers, and interpreting results cautiously can help strengthen the conclusions. The results frequently reflect tendencies observed in the research on sociolinguistics, pragmatics, and dialectology. Language-focused studies of this kind provide insight into the dynamics between language form, function, and meaning in media.
