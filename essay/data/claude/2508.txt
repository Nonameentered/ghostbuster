What advances have been made in the exploration and interpretation of the Avebury complex since the publication of Isobel Smith's work in 1965? Discuss some of the recent discoveries and their implications on the interpretation of the rest of the British Isles, including scientific procedures and aesthetic perspectives that have been applied to the site.

In 1965, Isobel Smith published Windmill Hill and Avebury: Excavations by Alexander Keiller, 1925-1939, which provided an overview of the major excavations undertaken at the Avebury prehistoric landscape in Wiltshire, England during the early 20th century. Since the publication of that seminal work, there have been many new discoveries and advances in the study of Avebury that provide additional insights into the meaning and purpose of this Neolithic marvel.

One of the most significant developments has been the application of new scientific dating techniques, such as radiocarbon dating, which have allowed for more precise dating of artifacts and sites at Avebury. We now know that Avebury and the surrounding monuments were constructed primarily during the late Neolithic period, roughly 3,000 to 2,600 BCE. The use of radiocarbon dating has also shed light on the temporal relationship between the various components of the Avebury complex, such as the sequence of construction of Windmill Hill, Avebury, West Kennet Long Barrow, and Silbury Hill. These new dating techniques have allowed us to develop a more coherent understanding of how the Avebury landscape evolved over time.

In terms of new discoveries, perhaps the most exciting finds have come from excavations at the Beckhampton Road site, located within the Avebury henge. Excavations in the 1990s and early 2000s uncovered a series of late Neolithic postholes, pits, and ditches, revealing that there were likely large timber structures within the henge in addition to the massive stone circles. The discoveries at Beckhampton Road suggest that Avebury was even more architecturally complex than previously understood. Artifacts found at Beckhampton Road, such as worked flint tools, animal bones, pottery, and human remains provide additional context about daily life and religious practices at Avebury. 

Geophysical surveys using techniques such as magnetometry, ground-penetrating radar, and electrical resistivity have also led to new insights at Avebury without requiring large-scale excavation. These non-invasive methods can detect subsurface features and provide a more complete map of archaeological remains. For example, geophysical surveys at Avebury have revealed a potential fourth stone circle as well as pits, ditches and postholes indicative of massive timber structures that are no longer visible. These surveys have allowed us to visualize what the Avebury landscape might have looked like during its peak use in the Neolithic.

In recent decades, there has also been a shift to appreciate Avebury from an experiential perspective, focusing not just on its archaeological aspects but also its sensory qualities. Avebury is now recognized as a sacred Neolithic landscape that was designed to facilitate spiritual experience. The immense scale of the sarsen stones, their dramatic and irregular forms, the play of light and shadow within the circles, and the interrelationship with other monuments in the surrounding landscape all combined to create a mystical effect. This emphasis on the phenomenological experience of Avebury represents an important new way of interpreting Neolithic ritual spaces that provides insight into the Neolithic cultural mindset.

In conclusion, since the publication of Windmill Hill and Avebury in 1965, advances in scientific dating, new archaeological discoveries, geophysical surveying techniques, and a focus on phenomenological experience have all deepened our understanding of the Avebury complex. These recent developments illuminate Avebury's architectural sophistication, provide context on daily life in the late Neolithic, and give us a sense of how our Neolithic ancestors might have perceived and interacted with this stunning ritual landscape. The study of Avebury continues to provide new insights into Neolithic Britain and shape our view of this influential era in prehistory.
