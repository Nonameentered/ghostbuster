Organic farmers face significant challenges in controlling weeds compared to conventional farmers who can use synthetic herbicides. Weeds compete with crop plants for water, nutrients, space and light, and can reduce crop yields by up to 80% if left uncontrolled. The main methods for controlling weeds in organic farming include crop rotation, mulching, mechanical weeding and biological controls, but these techniques have their limitations. A new approach using smoke water as a natural herbicide shows promise as another weed control method that is compatible with organic practices.

Crop rotation, growing a sequence of different crops on the same land, is a key weed control strategy in organic farming. Different crops have varying abilities to compete with weeds, and rotating can reduce the spread of perennial weeds as their life cycles are disrupted. However, there are limited options for rotation, and certain weed species may still persist. Mulching using organic materials such as straw or grass clippings can physically suppress weeds and reduce their access to light, but only controls weeds for a limited time and can be expensive.

Mechanical weeding using equipment such as cultivators, hoes, and tine weeders can physically remove weeds, but requires significant labour and time, and is not effective against all weed species. Biological controls, using natural enemies such as insects or microbial agents to control weeds, are still limited due to a lack of reliable and affordable agents for most weed species. With limited herbicides approved for use in organic farming, there remains an ongoing need for better methods to help organic farmers control persistent and competitive weeds.

Recent research has found that dilute smoke water, produced by bubbling smoke through water, can have herbicidal effects on weeds. The active compounds in smoke, such as phenols, can enter through the leaves and roots of plants and interfere with germination, growth, and enzyme production. Trials using smoke water from burning organic matter such as wood, straw, and seaweed have found it effectively controls several weed species. Being made from natural plant material and unpurified smoke, smoke water would likely qualify as an allowed organic weed control substance, providing a simple and inexpensive new tool for organic farmers.

While smoke water shows promising herbicidal effects on select weeds, its weed control potential, cost-effectiveness, and safety must be tested more rigourously across various climates and soil types. If proven effective, safe, and permitted under organic standards, smoke water could provide organic farmers with another method for controlling competitive weeds, especially where other techniques have limited success. With integrative weed management, using smoke water alongside crop rotation, mulching, mechanical control and in some cases limited herbicide use where permitted, organic farmers may reach a level of weed control that allows more widespread adoption of organic methods.

In summary, while organic farmers face significant challenges controlling persistent weeds without synthetic herbicides, a multi-tactic approach including emerging tools such as natural smoke water may provide more effective and affordable weed control solutions compatible with organic practices. With ongoing research and integration of the best available weed control techniques, organic farmers can overcome this key barrier to productivity and expansion.
