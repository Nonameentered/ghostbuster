Here is a draft essay in roughly 2000 words on the themes of religion and theology presented in John Donne's sonnets, focusing on the political and social context of 17th century England:

John Donne's poetry is rich with references to religion and theological themes that were central to his cultural context in 17th century England. During this time, England was in a period of great religious turmoil, having firmly established the Anglican Church and split from the Catholic Church. Donne himself converted from Catholicism to Anglicanism, so his poetry reflects a deep engagement with religious questions of faith, doubt, sin, and salvation that were pressing issues of debate in his time.

In his early poems, Donne expresses a tension between religious faith and doubt. For example, in "The Flea," the speaker uses the metaphor of a flea biting two lovers to argue that the union of their blood through the flea represents a kind of consummation of their love, so they might as well make love. The witty metaphysical conceit suggests a skepticism towards religious prohibitions against premarital sex. However, in other poems like "Holy Sonnet 14," Donne expresses deep anguish over his sins and a desire for God's forgiveness and grace: "Batter my heart, three-person'd God; for you / As yet but knock; breathe, shine, and seek to mend." The speaker acknowledges his own unworthiness before God's power and seeks redemption.

Donne was also deeply engaged with the theological debates of the English Reformation. In "Satire III," he criticizes the materialism of the Catholic Church and expresses support for the Protestant belief in an individual's direct relationship with God. However, in other poems Donne is less certain about humanity's spiritual state alone without the church. In Holy Sonnet 16, the speaker contends, "If poisonous minerals, and if that tree, / Whose fruit threw death on else immortal us, / Ought not be suffered, as a nurse which is  / Aidant and helpful." Although Donne ultimately converted to the Anglican Church, his poetry reflects the theological tensions of the English Reformation.

In sum, Donne's sonnets present a complex set of attitudes towards religion that engage with the debates over faith, doubt, sin, and redemption that defined 17th century England. Through metaphysical wit and poetic skill, Donne reflects on deep questions of spirituality while also criticizing religious institutions and commenting on contemporary politics. His poetry thus provides a glimpse into the religious turmoil and theological thinking that characterized his age.
