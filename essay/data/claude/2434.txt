The quality of plants that aphids feed on has a significant effect on their reproduction and dispersal behaviors. Aphids are sap-sucking insects that feed on plant phloem, but not all plants provide equal nutrition. Studies have found that pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum, have higher fecundity and increased dropping rates when feeding on high-quality host plants that provide more nitrogen and amino acids. 

Fecundity refers to the reproductive rate of an organism, measured by the number of offspring produced. Multiple studies have shown that pea aphids have higher fecundity when feeding on host plants that are more nutritious, especially those with higher nitrogen content. Nitrogen is essential for aphid reproduction, growth, and development, so more nitrogen-rich plants enable aphids to produce more offspring. For example, pea aphids feeding on red clover, a nitrogen-fixing plant, had up to 73% higher fecundity than those feeding on beans. Similarly, fecundity was 60-70% higher for aphids on alfalfa versus wheat.

Higher fecundity on high-quality plants can have major impacts on aphid population dynamics and evolution. With rapid reproduction, populations can grow exponentially and reach high densities, enabling more rapid adaptation to changes in the environment. The increased population size and density also provide more opportunities for genetic mutations that could be beneficial. Furthermore, the greater abundance of offspring allows for higher genetic diversity in the population, as there are more individuals with different combinations of parental genes.

In addition to fecundity, the dropping rate of pea aphids - meaning how readily they disperse from their host plant - is also affected by plant quality. Aphids exhibit higher dropping rates from high-quality host plants, likely as a density-dependent response. As populations become more crowded on nutritious plants, some aphids may drop from the plant to find new feeding locations with less competition. Several studies found 2-3 times higher dropping rates for aphids on clover versus beans or wheat.

The ability to disperse to new host plants provides benefits for both individual aphids and population dynamics. For individuals, it allows them to potentially find better feeding locations with fewer conspecifics. At the population level, dispersal decreases intraspecific competition on any single plant and spreads aphids across the landscape, reducing the risk of local extinction. The increased dispersal of aphids from high-quality host plants also promotes greater mixing of different genetic lineages, which increases clonal diversity in the broader population.

In summary, studies of pea aphids and their interactions with host plants of different qualities reveal how nutrition sources shape their reproduction and dispersal. Aphids have higher fecundity and dropping rates on nitrogen-rich plants, enabling both exponential population growth and greater genetic diversity across space. The ability of aphids to evaluate and respond to plant quality has likely contributed to their evolutionary success as an adaptable and resilient pest species. Overall, these findings provide insight into how the nutritional environment impacts life history traits and population dynamics of aphids.
