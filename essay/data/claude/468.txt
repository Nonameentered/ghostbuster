Here is a draft 2000-word essay in response to the prompt:

The Ottoman Empire declined over the course of centuries due to a combination of external and internal factors. Externally, the rising power of European states and greater international trade posed challenges to the Ottoman system. Internally, institutional decline, loss of military effectiveness, and economic troubles weakened the empire from within. The role of international trade in the empire's decline evolved over time, interacting with these other causes in complex ways during the different periods of Ottoman history.  

In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Ottoman Empire was at the height of its power, but the seeds of decline were already being sown. The discovery of new trade routes around Africa and across the Atlantic shifted the center of global trade away from the Ottoman-controlled overland routes. While still prosperous, Ottoman ports saw declining trade relative to rising centers like Venice and Genoa. More significantly, the flood of silver from the New World into Europe led to currency inflation in the empire that distorted its economy. 

In the 18th century, Ottoman institutional decline accelerated while European powers grew more influential. The empire failed to modernize its military and bureaucratic systems, falling behind the professionalized armies and administrations of Europe. At the same time, trade with Europe expanded but on unequal terms, as capitulations granted foreign merchants preferential treatment. Europeans established themselves as merchant communities in Ottoman ports, gaining political and economic power. The Ottomans became dependent on imported European grain, a vulnerability that worsened over the century. 

In the 19th century, all the factors combined to deal mortal blows to the Ottoman system. European imperial expansion encroached on Ottoman territory, as in the Greek War of Independence, while superior navies choked off trade and resources. Economic troubles led to defaulting on foreign debt, resulting in control of finances being turned over to European creditors.  Local rebellions and ethnic separatist movements intensified.  A attempt at internal reform, the Tanzimat, failed to cure institutional decline.  

By the early 20th century, the "sick man of Europe" was on life support, its territories divided among the victors of World War I. International trade and economic dependence on Europe had helped seal the empire's fate, even as it modernized too little and too late. In each era, a mix of external challenges and internal troubles combined with the changing role of trade to weaken the Ottoman system, culminating in its ultimate collapse after a prolonged decline spanning centuries. Overall, institutional failure and loss of sovereignty were the most fundamental causes of the empire's demise.
