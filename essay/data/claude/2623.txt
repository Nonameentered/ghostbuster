The Roskilde Fjord project in Denmark has investigated Viking-age shipbuilding practices and seafaring culture through the reconstruction and analysis of Viking ships. The project has many strengths in its novel experimental archaeology approach and has yielded significant contributions to understanding Viking-age shipping and society. However, the project also has some weaknesses in its limited scope and uncertain accuracy of reconstructions.  

A key strength of the Roskilde Fjord project is its experimental archaeology methodology. The project researchers built and tested reconstructions of Viking ship types based on archaeological evidence to gain direct insights into Viking shipbuilding techniques, sailing capabilities, and life onboard. This experimental approach provides a level of detail and understanding that cannot be achieved through artifacts and documents alone. For example, the reconstruction of the Skuldelev 2 helped elucidate many construction details absent from the archaeological record. The reconstructions also demonstrated the shipsâ€™ speed, durability, and handling, highlighting the technological achievements of Viking shipwrights.

Another strength of the project is its findings on Viking ship typology and evolution. The reconstructions spanned over 700 years of Viking ship development, from the early Skuldelev 1 trading vessel to the late Skuldelev 3 warship. Analysis of these ships has outlined a progression from wider, deeper trading ships to longer, faster warships, reflecting changes in Viking trade networks and warfare. The reconstructions have also verified that Vikings deliberately built ships for different purposes, contradicting notions that Viking ships were generalist vessels. These insights provide a foundation for interpreting Viking socioeconomic changes through ship archaeology.

However, the project scope is limited to a small sample of Viking ship types, excluding other variants that may yield different insights. The reconstructions depend heavily on individual archaeological finds from Roskilde Fjord, limiting the representation of regional or temporal diversity in Viking shipbuilding traditions across Scandinavia and the Viking expansion. Additionally, there are uncertainties regarding the accuracy of the reconstructions because many details of the original ships remain unknown. The project findings thus should be interpreted cautiously and as part of wider scholarship.

In summary, the Roskilde Fjord project has pioneered an experimental archaeology approach to studying Viking-age shipbuilding and maritime culture that has yielded significant contributions. The project reconstructions and comparative analyses have provided substantial evidence for interpreting Viking ship typologies, technological capabilities, and social changes. However, the limitations in scope and uncertainties inherent to reconstructions mean the findings should not be overgeneralized or seen as conclusive. Overall, the project represents an innovative method for understanding Viking-age seafaring and society that, combined with other archaeological and historical evidence, offers a glimpse into the diverse and dynamic ships and seafarers of the Viking world.
