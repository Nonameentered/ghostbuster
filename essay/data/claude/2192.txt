The yield and melting point of a condensation reaction can be affected by several experimental factors. These include the purity of starting materials, concentrations of reactants, temperature and duration of reaction, and thoroughness of purification methods. By controlling these variables, a higher yield and a sharp melting point can be obtained.

To begin with, the purity of starting materials is critical to achieving an optimal yield and melting point. Impure reactants can lead to side products and a lower yield. They can also result in a impure product with a depressed and broad melting point range. To maximize purity, reactants should be freshly distilled or recrystallized before use. Storage conditions should also be considered to avoid moisture or contamination.  

The concentrations of reactants also play an important role. Too high of a concentration can lead to the formation of side products and decrease yield. Too low of a concentration results in an incomplete reaction and reduced yield. The optimal concentrations should be determined experimentally to maximize yield. The ratio of reactants added should also match the stoichiometric ratio to produce the expected condensation product.  

The reaction temperature and time are other key factors to consider. Higher temperatures increase molecular collision frequency and speed up the reaction. However, excessively high temperatures can also encourage side reactions. The ideal temperature should be high enough to achieve a reasonable rate of reaction in a suitable time frame. Prolonging the reaction time at a given temperature does not necessarily increase yield and can result in product decomposition. Monitoring the progress of reaction with techniques like thin layer chromatography can help determine the optimal time to workup the reaction.

Finally, the purification method and efficiency play a role in the properties of the final product. An appropriate recrystallization solvent and temperature should be selected to maximize recovery of pure product. Removing impurities via filtration before crystallization and using a minimal amount of solvent help produce high quality crystals. Ensuring all residual solvent is removed under vacuum also gives an accurate melting point range.  

In summary, the key to achieving an optimal yield and melting point in a condensation reaction is carefully controlling experimental conditions and purification methods. By using high purity starting materials, suitable concentrations and temperatures, appropriate reaction times, and effective recrystallization, high yields and a sharp melting point can be obtained. Adapting conditions on the basis of experimental observations also helps maximize the outcome. Overall, precision and reproducibility are vital to success in this laboratory technique.
