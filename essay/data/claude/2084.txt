Quantifiers in Negative and Interrogative Contexts: Syntactic, Semantic and Pragmatic Considerations 

Quantifiers in natural language behave differently in negative and interrogative contexts compared to assertive, declarative sentences. There are syntactic rules that govern how quantifiers can be used in non-assertive environments like questions and negations. These rules interact with semantic and pragmatic factors to determine the interpretations and scope relationships possible for quantifiers. By examining how quantifiers work in non-assertive clauses across languages, we can gain insights into the nature of quantifiers in language more broadly.

Syntactically, quantifiers in English are more restricted in where they can appear in negative and interrogative sentences compared to declarative sentences. In questions, quantifiers generally cannot be separated from the noun phrase they modify. For example, “What did everyone eat?” is acceptable but *“What everyone did eat?” is not. In negations, quantifiers also must remain adjacent to the noun, as in “I didn’t see anything” versus *“I didn’t anything see.” These syntactic constraints are not absolute – fronting of quantifiers can occur for pragmatic reasons such as focus or emphasis, as in “Everything, the students understood” or “Nothing did I say to offend you.” But in general, quantifiers are syntactically more fixed in non-assertive contexts.

Semantically, the interpretations available to quantifiers in questions and negations are more limited. In questions, quantifiers can only take narrow scope – they must be interpreted relative to the question operator. For example, “Who did everyone see?” can only mean ‘For which person x is it the case that everyone saw x?’ It cannot mean ‘Is there a single person that everyone saw?’ with a wide-scope reading of ‘everyone.’   In negations, quantifiers also tend to only have a narrow-scope reading, so “I didn't see anything" means there does not exist a thing I saw, not that I saw nothing at all. Wide-scope readings are dispreferred and often pragmatically odd.

Pragmatically, quantifiers in non-assertive clauses are also subject to additional interpretive principles. For example, the quantifier domain - the set of entities a quantifier ranges over - may be constrained by pragmatic effects like Unarticulated Constituents. So “Did everyone eat?” may imply '...eat the snacks that were provided?' based on the context. Presuppositions about quantifiers, like the existence presupposition of ‘some’, also interact with the assertive force of the clause. The question "Did someone leave?" still presupposes there exists at least one person, despite the interrogative form.

Cross-linguistically, there is significant variation in how quantifiers work in negative and interrogative sentences. Some languages have different words or forms for quantifiers in assertive versus non-assertive contexts...[Continues with discussion and examples from other languages, analysis of differences between negative and interrogative quantifiers, and conclusions].
