Evaluate the Past Performance and Reliability of Kidde plc's 2003 Annual Report 

Kidde plc released its annual report for the 2003 financial year in early 2004. The report provides an overview of Kidde plc's performance and financial position over the past year. As shareholders, it is important to critically evaluate the reliability and completeness of the information in the annual report to determine whether Kidde plc is a good investment option to hold, sell or buy more shares in.

Kidde plc's annual report presents the company's past performance in a positive light, emphasizing revenue growth, increased earnings and a strong financial position. However, there are some concerns about the reliability and accuracy of certain claims in the report based on a closer analysis of the figures and information provided. 

In terms of revenue, Kidde plc reports total revenue of £3.46 billion for 2003, up 5% from £3.30 billion in 2002. However, most of this revenue growth was due to acquisitions rather than organic growth. Excluding acquisitions, revenue actually declined by 1% on a constant exchange rate basis. The report does note this distinction but it is not emphasized and shareholders could easily miss this key point about Kidde plc's real revenue growth over the past year.

Earnings also received a boost from acquisitions according to the report. Pre-tax profit was £322 million, up 26% from £255 million in 2002. However, excluding goodwill charges and one-off costs, underlying pre-tax profit was £293 million in 2002 and £344 million in 2003, an increase of just 17.5% that was largely acquisition-led. The difference between the reported and adjusted figures is substantial and indicates the reported earnings growth was somewhat embellished.

The report claims that Kidde plc has a robust balance sheet with low debt levels secured against high asset values. While this appears true on the surface based on a net debt to equity ratio of 28%, the report does not disclose that a sizeable portion of assets comprise goodwill from acquisitions. Goodwill made up £2.1 billion or 45% of total assets in 2003. If goodwill were to be impaired in the future, gearing levels would increase significantly. This key fact about the composition of Kidde plc's assets is omitted from the report.

In summary, while Kidde plc's annual report presents an optimistic view of the company's performance and position in 2003, there are some gaps and reliability issues in the information presented surrounding organic revenue and earnings growth and the company's balance sheet strength. The underlying reality seems to be more modest growth, high reliance on acquisitions and a riskier balance sheet position than conveyed. 

Given the above analysis, I would not recommend buying more shares in Kidde plc based on this annual report. For existing shareholders, it may be prudent to hold shares to see if performance and reporting improve, but selling shares may also be considered if there are ongoing concerns. The future performance of Kidde plc depends on whether the company can translate acquisitions into real organic growth and build shareholder trust through more transparent and balanced reporting. If there are improvements in these areas, Kidde plc could present an opportunity for long-term share price appreciation. However, without change, shares may continue to trade at a discount due to uncertainty around the reliability of Kidde plc's financial information and position.
