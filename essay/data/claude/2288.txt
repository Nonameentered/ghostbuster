The concept of 'Open' in Information Technology refers to the open accessibility and transparency enabled by certain technologies, standards, and practices. There are three major domains where 'Open' has significant implications: Open Source Software, Open Source Hardware, and Open Data Standards. 

Open Source Software refers to software with source code that is made freely available for anyone to inspect, modify, and build upon. The open availability of the source code allows the software to be improved over time through community contributions. Popular examples of Open Source Software include Linux, Android, WordPress, and Mozilla Firefox. The open source model fosters rapid innovation and lower costs since the software is developed collaboratively. However, the lack of intellectual property control also means there may be less monetary incentive for initial creators. There is an ongoing debate on whether open or proprietary software models lead to more overall innovation.

Open Source Hardware refers to physical artifacts with publicly shared design specifications that allow for open study, modification, and creation. For example, the designs for 3D printers like the RepRap are open source, allowing people to build and modify their own 3D printers. The Open Compute Project makes the designs for very efficient computer servers openly available. While Open Source Hardware enables open collaboration and more customized use, it may also mean less potential for commercial gain since the designs are shared publicly. 

Open Data Standards refer to public specifications that define how information should be structured, formatted, and shared between systems. For example, standards like HTTP, HTML, and CSS enable the interoperability of the World Wide Web. More recently, standards like XML, JSON, and the Open Data Protocol have allowed for greater openness and connectivity of web services. When more systems adopt the same open standards, data can be shared and reused across communities and applications. However, achieving widespread adoption of standards requires overcoming incentives to use proprietary formats.

In conclusion, the openness fostered by these technologies, standards and practices leads to both opportunities and challenges. The key benefits of openness include increased transparency, customizability, collaboration, and interoperability. However, openness may also reduce incentives for initial creation and adoption if there are limited opportunities for commercial gain. Patents and proprietary systems aim to provide those commercial incentives, but risk limiting openness if taken too far. Overall, there must be a balance between openness and proprietary control to optimize innovation in Information Technology.
