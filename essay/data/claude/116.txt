The performance of a domestic solar collector water heating system in London can vary significantly throughout the year due to the city's climate. London has a temperate climate with cool winters and warm summers. The solar collector system will perform best during the summer months from June to August when there are the most hours of sunlight and the highest solar intensity. The system can heat up to 70-80% of a household's hot water needs during these months, resulting in major cost savings compared to electric or gas water heating systems.  

In the spring and fall from April to May and September to October, the solar collector system will still provide around 50-60% of hot water heating needs on average. The day lengths are shorter than summer but there are still a reasonable number of hours of sunlight to effectively heat water using the solar panels. Cost savings during these months will still be quite substantial compared to conventional water heating. 

The solar collector system will perform the worst during the winter months of December through February. There are few hours of sunlight during these months, especially in December which has the shortest days of the year. The solar intensity is also lower in the winter. As a result, the solar collector system may only provide around 20-30% of the hot water heating demand. The system will need to be supplemented significantly by the conventional electric or gas water heater during these months. Cost savings will be minimal compared to the rest of the year. 

Overall, a domestic solar collector water heating system in London can provide around 50-70% of a household's annual hot water heating needs. This can translate to energy bill savings of 30-50% per year compared to electric water heating and 50-70% compared to gas water heating. The actual cost savings will depend on factors like solar panel size, hot water usage, and current energy rates. While the performance varies throughout the year, solar collector systems provide the most savings during the summer but can still be effective in the spring and fall, resulting in lower utility bills throughout most of the year. With government incentives and rebates, a solar collector system in London can pay for itself within 8-12 years through the energy cost savings.
