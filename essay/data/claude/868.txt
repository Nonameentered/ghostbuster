Erving Goffman, a prominent 20th-century sociologist, proposed a dramaturgical perspective on social interaction and the presentation of self. Goffman used concepts from theater and performance, such as "performance," "audience," "stagecraft," and "frontstage vs. backstage," as metaphors to analyze how individuals construct and negotiate their sense of self during social interactions. 

According to Goffman, social interactions can be understood as "performances" in which individuals actively construct a version of themselves for audiences. Just as actors perform different roles on stage, individuals perform different versions of themselves depending on the social situation and audience. These performances are crafted using various techniques of "impression management" and "stagecraft" to guide the audience's perception of the individual. For example, a teacher may perform the role of a stern, authoritative figure in the classroom but perform as a more casual, laidback person with friends at a bar after work.

A key part of Goffman's theory is the distinction between the "frontstage" and "backstage" self. The frontstage self refers to the public performance of self that individuals construct for audiences during social interactions. The backstage self refers to a more private version of self that individuals can relax into when no audiences are present. Frontstage performances require individuals to consciously manage how they are perceived by audiences, whereas backstage individuals can drop their performances and be more authentic.

Goffman's dramaturgical perspective contrasts with the traditional Chicago school's symbolic interactionist approach in some key ways. While symbolic interactionists focused on how individuals construct self-concepts through social interactions and interpretive processes, Goffman emphasized how these self-concepts are actively performed and negotiated with audiences. The self, for Goffman, was more fluid, fragmented and audience-dependent than the unitary self-concept proposed by Mead and other symbolic interactionists.  

Goffman also differed in his view that individuals can manipulate and deceive audiences in their dramaturgical performances. Symbolic interactionists typically viewed social interaction as more genuine, assuming individuals share authentic understandings with one another. In contrast, Goffman proposed that individuals can purposefully manage impressions and conceal parts of themselves to suit their audiences and social situations. 

In summary, Goffman proposed a dramaturgical model of social life in which the self emerges through performed interactions with audiences rather than as a product of interpretive processes. His concepts of "performance," "impression management" and "frontstage vs. backstage" provide a means to analyze how individuals construct their sense of self and navigate social norms during interactions with different audiences and in different social spheres. Goffman's dramaturgical perspective shares some similarities with but ultimately contrasts in key ways from the symbolic interactionist tradition of understanding the social construction of self and identity.
