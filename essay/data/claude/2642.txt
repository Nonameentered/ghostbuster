The experimental procedure used to hydrogenate Methyl Oleate into Methyl Stearate involved the use of a nickel catalyst to facilitate the addition of hydrogen gas to the double bonds of Methyl Oleate. Methyl Oleate, with the chemical formula C19H36O2, is an unsaturated ester compound containing one double bond. Hydrogenation of this double bond resulted in Methyl Stearate, with the chemical formula C19H38O2, which is a saturated ester compound. 

To perform the hydrogenation reaction, a solution of Methyl Oleate dissolved in hexane was prepared with a concentration of 0.1 M. A nickel catalyst was activated by heating it under flowing hydrogen gas for 30 minutes. The Methyl Oleate solution was then transferred to a glass reactor along with the activated nickel catalyst. The reactor was sealed, purged of air, and then pressurized to 30 psi with hydrogen gas. The reaction mixture was stirred and heated to 70Â°C.

The progress of the hydrogenation reaction was monitored using thin layer chromatography (TLC). Samples of the reaction mixture were taken at 30-minute intervals and spotted onto TLC plates. The TLC plates were developed using a 70:30 hexane:ethyl acetate solvent system. Methyl Oleate had an Rf value of 0.85, while the hydrogenated product Methyl Stearate had an Rf value of 0.95. As the reaction proceeded, the spot for Methyl Oleate diminished in intensity and the spot for Methyl Stearate increased in intensity, indicating the conversion of starting material into the product.

However, there were some challenges encountered during the experiment. Initially, the nickel catalyst did not seem very active, and after 2 hours, there was still a significant spot remaining for unreacted Methyl Oleate on the TLC plate. The reactor was then repressurized to 60 psi with hydrogen gas and heating was continued for another 3 hours. This additional hydrogen pressure and time allowed the reaction to go to completion. Possible reasons for the initial lack of catalyst activity could include incomplete activation of the nickel catalyst or impurities present in the hydrogen gas or solvent decreasing catalytic activity.

In conclusion, this experiment demonstrated the catalytic hydrogenation of an unsaturated ester, Methyl Oleate, into a saturated ester, Methyl Stearate. Thin layer chromatography was used to successfully monitor the progress of the reaction by observing the decreasing intensity of the Methyl Oleate spot and increasing intensity of the Methyl Stearate spot. Although challenges with catalyst activity were encountered, increasing the hydrogen pressure and reaction time allowed the reaction to proceed to completion. The differences in Rf values and spot intensities for the two compounds on the TLC plate showed how hydrogenation changed the physical and chemical properties of the molecule.
