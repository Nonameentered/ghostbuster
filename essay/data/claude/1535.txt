Does Social Class Influence Leisure Choices in the Opera Sector?

Social class has long been considered an important factor in determining an individual's leisure choices and consumption patterns. The traditional paradigm holds that a person's social class, defined by objective factors such as income, education, and occupation, shapes their habitus and cultural capital, influencing their subjective tastes and leisure preferences. However, postmodern theorists argue that in today's mass media society, traditional social classes are declining in importance and leisure choices are more heterogeneous and individualistic. 

While social class may be declining as a determinant of some leisure activities, it continues to exert a strong influence on participation in high culture activities with a history of being elite pursuits, such as opera attendance. Opera has traditionally been associated with the upper classes and requires certain forms of cultural capital to appreciate. Pierre Bourdieu argued that a person's habitus, or socialized norms and dispositions, develops based on their social class. The habitus of the upper class inclines them to appreciate and participate in elite leisure activities like opera, while other classes are excluded by their lack of the necessary cultural capital.

The upper class, due to their high levels of income and education, has the means and opportunity to develop an appreciation for elite leisure pursuits. They have the income to afford expensive opera tickets and the education to have developed an understanding of opera's complexities. For the upper class, attending the opera is a way to signal status and distinction. In contrast, the middle and working classes are less likely to have the means or education to develop an appreciation for opera. However, some individuals in these classes may gain cultural capital and adopt upper class tastes through education and career success.

At the same time, the "celebrity elite" class has emerged, made up of highly visible, successful individuals from a diversity of backgrounds. This new class accumulates cultural capital and status through its celebrity. Members of this class may attend the opera more as a symbol of their new elite status rather than due to a lifelong habitus of cultural appreciation. Their participation may be more performative than that of the traditional upper class.

In conclusion, while social class may be declining in some areas of society, it continues to have an important influence on participation in elite leisure pursuits like opera that have historically been associated with and require the cultural capital of the upper classes. Both objective factors like income and education as well as subjective factors like habitus and tastes shape an individual's likelihood of participating in an elite activity such as opera attendance. However, the rise of postmodernism and new elite classes like the "celebrity elite" have introduced more heterogeneity and performativity into opera participation. Although social class remains relevant, its influence on opera attendance and other elite leisure activities is evolving.
