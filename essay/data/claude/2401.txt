The Leckford Estate in Hampshire, England, is owned and operated by the John Lewis Partnership, one of the largest employee-owned organizations in the United Kingdom. The main objectives of Leckford Estate are to produce high-quality agricultural products to supply John Lewis Partnership stores and to directly educate consumers about the benefits of locally and ethically-sourced food. To achieve these objectives, Leckford Estate has a management structure and several programs designed specifically for educating consumers and building relationships.  

The management structure of Leckford Estate consists of directors, a resident-estate manager, and various team managers overseeing departments such as arable crops, livestock, leisure, and retail sales. These managers ensure sustainable yet productive agricultural practices, high-quality yields, and efforts to link consumers with their local food source. Because John Lewis Partnership employees, or Partners, own and govern the organization, management structures are designed to be flat and collaborative, giving all Partners a voice in decisions impacting the estate. Partners across John Lewis Partnership’s locations visit Leckford Estate frequently to stay connected with its operations and provide feedback.   

One way Leckford Estate connects consumers with their food source is through on-site grocery and butchery shops featuring estate-grown produce, meet, and prepared foods. The shops give customers an opportunity to shop in the location where many products are grown and made and speak with the farmers and producers responsible for the food. Partners receive discounts on products from the shops as an employee benefit. Tours and open days at Leckford Estate also help build customer relationships. Families can take tours to learn about chicken hatching, beekeeping, milking cows, and more. Annual open days and festivals invite customers to visit at no cost, participate in agricultural activities, and sample locally-sourced foods.  

Leckford Estate runs promotional partnerships with John Lewis Partnership stores to raise brand awareness. Products like Leckford Estate rapeseed oil, honey, and prepared meals are sold in Waitrose stores alongside stories and images of the estate. Waitrose promotions often highlight Leckford Estate beef, produce, and dairy. Signage educates customers on the ethical and sustainable farming values of Leckford Estate. Waitrose loyalty cards and coupons frequently offer discounts on Leckford Estate products. Likewise, the Leckford Estate shops accept Waitrose loyalty cards and coupons, strengthening the link between the two brands in customers’ minds. 

In conclusion, Leckford Estate achieves its objectives to produce high-quality agricultural yield and connect consumers to their food source through an organized management structure, on-site retail, tours and open days, and in-store promotional partnerships with the John Lewis Partnership. Leckford Estate offers a locally-sourced food experience and forms meaningful relationships with customers to build brand loyalty for both the estate and the Partnership. The collaborative employee-owned ethos of the John Lewis Partnership is evident in Leckford Estate’s operations and its mission to provide customers personal connections with the food they eat.
