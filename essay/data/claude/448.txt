Peru faced significant challenges in integrating its large indigenous population into the nation during the 19th century. The indigenous peoples of Peru, including the Quechua and Aymara, made up the vast majority of the population. However, they remained largely outside of mainstream Peruvian society, economy, and politics. The Peruvian government grappled with how to incorporate the indigenous population into the nation, referred to as the "Indian Problem." The policies they pursued had a lasting impact on Peru's social and political fabric.  

A major challenge was the vast cultural and linguistic differences between the indigenous peoples and the Hispanic elite. The indigenous groups had their own languages, beliefs, and customs that differed greatly from the Hispanic culture promoted by the government. There were also deep racial prejudices against the indigenous population. The Hispanic elite saw themselves as superior and looked down upon the indigenous groups. They believed the indigenous peoples needed to abandon their "primitive" ways and assimilate into Hispanic culture to become "civilized."

The government's primary approach to addressing this challenge was a policy of Hispanicization. They sought to spread the Spanish language and Catholic faith, while stamping out indigenous languages, religions, and customs. However, these policies were largely unsuccessful and just bred resentment. The indigenous groups were unwilling to completely abandon their cultural heritage. The government lacked the resources and influence to dramatically change indigenous ways of life across a population of millions in the harsh Andean highlands.

A second major challenge was the economic inequality between the indigenous population and other groups. The indigenous peoples were largely poor farmers, while wealth was concentrated among the Hispanic elite. This inequality fed social tensions and prevented the indigenous from fully integrating into Peruvian society. The government pursued policies like taxation, mandatory labor, and land appropriation that exploited the indigenous population and increased their economic hardships. At times, these policies even resulted in violent uprisings by indigenous groups.

The government's failure to meaningfully address these economic and social challenges resulted in the continued marginalization of indigenous groups. They remained outside of positions of power and influence. While Peru transitioned to a democratic republic in the 19th century, voting rights were restricted to the educated and economically independent - effectively disenfranchising most of the indigenous population. They had little say in shaping government policies or Peruvian identity.  

In conclusion, Peru grappled with substantial challenges in integrating its indigenous peoples into a unified nation during the 19th century. However, the policies of Hispanicization and economic exploitation pursued by the government contributed to the continued marginalization of indigenous groups, shaping a society divided along ethnic and class lines. The legacies of these policies and social tensions would endure in Peru for generations. Overall, the government's approach to the "Indian Problem" during this period greatly impacted the development of Peru's social and political makeup in ways still felt today.
