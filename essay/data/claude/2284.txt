Here is a 1250 word essay response to the prompt:

The client for the SoccerBooker.com website had several key requirements that needed to be implemented in the website's design and functionality. The primary goal of SoccerBooker.com is to provide an easy to use website where soccer enthusiasts can book training sessions and reserve soccer pitches for casual or competitive play.

The first requirement from the client was that the website had to have an intuitive user experience for visitors and customers. The design of the site was focused on clean layouts, simple navigation, and ease of locating important information or purchasing services. The home page immediately greets visitors with eye-catching photos of soccer fields and athletes. The main navigation menu at the top has only four clear options: Home, Training, Pitches, and Account. Each page on the site has a similar, consistent layout, so once a customer learns how to use one part of the site, they can easily transfer those skills to other sections. 

A second key requirement was enabling customers to easily book and pay for training sessions and pitch rentals. On the Training and Pitches pages, the website offers filtering and search options to help customers find relevant options. They can filter by location, date, time, age group, and skill level. Once a customer finds a suitable training session or pitch reservation, they proceed to a booking checkout where they provide payment details to complete the transaction. The payment integration allows for simple and secure payments via credit card to make the booking experience seamless for customers. 

Another requirement was for the website to have a customer account system where clients can view their booking history, save payment details, leave reviews, and receive special offers. The Account pages on the site satisfy this requirement. Customers can create an account with just a name, email, and password. Their account dashboard shows them an overview of their upcoming and past bookings and saved payment methods. The site's operators can also communicate directly with customers through the messaging and notifications system.

In summary, the key requirements from the client for the SoccerBooker.com website were: an intuitive user experience; streamlined booking and payment functionality for services; and a full-featured customer account system. Through a clean design, seamless ecommerce platform, and account tools, SoccerBooker.com was able to satisfy all of these requirements and develop an easy to use website for their soccer training and pitch rental services. The website has succeeded in achieving the client's goals and vision.
