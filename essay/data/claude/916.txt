The objective of the simulation project for Aimil Pharmaceuticals in India is to determine the optimal configuration and schedule for lorry traffic and loading/offloading to maximize the plant's efficiency. The main challenges facing efficiency are congestion from the lorries arriving and departing that clog the loading docks and roads in and out of the plant, inefficient utilization of the loading docks due to lorries arriving at different times, and long wait times for lorries arriving which reduces the time they have to transport goods after being loaded or offloaded, limiting the total number of trips they can make per day.

To ensure all lorries finish their work by 5pm, the project will need to schedule specific arrival and departure windows for the lorries to reduce congestion. There will need to be multiple check-in and off-loading points, likely at least three for check-in where the lorries arrive and can be queued to wait their turn at a loading dock, and at least two for off-loading where lorries that have completed loading can exit the facility. Limiting check-in to three windows—7am-9am, 11am-1pm, and 3pm-5pm—and off-loading to two windows—10am-12pm and 2pm-4pm—provides enough capacity without too much congestion while still allowing lorries enough trips per day if each window is one hour. 

With at least three check-in points and two off-loading points under this schedule, a minimum total of five loading docks are required to ensure all lorries finish by 5pm. Three check-in points for the 7-9am window and two loading docks can service up to 6 lorries arriving per hour for a total of 12 lorries. The 11am-1pm window has the same capacity, allowing another 12 lorries to be loaded. Finally, the 3-5pm window with three check-in points and two off-loading points has a capacity of 10 lorries arriving and 10 departing. This provides a total capacity of 34 lorries which can finish loading and offloading and exit by the 5pm deadline. 

However, this schedule and capacity is based on several key assumptions and limitations. It assumes consistent arrival rates for lorries in each timeframe and that loading and offloading takes approximately one hour per lorry. If arrival rates are higher or the time required for each lorry is longer, the capacity of the loading docks and off-loading points may need to be increased. The model is also limited to a single eight-hour workday, so it does not account for potential congestion impacts on the following workday from lorries still in the loading yard after 5pm. The optimal solution may need to consider operations for a full 24-hour period or multiple consecutive workdays to fully maximize efficiency.

In conclusion, the objective of maximizing plant efficiency for Aimil Pharmaceuticals' lorry operations can be achieved through a well-designed schedule of check-in/off-loading points and loading dock capacity. By coordinating specific arrival and departure windows, multiple points for lorries to check-in and off-load to keep traffic flowing, and adequate loading dock capacity, the facility can ensure all daily lorry work is completed by the deadline of 5pm. However, further enhancements and adjustments to the model may be required based on actual arrival rates, average loading/offloading times, and a need to consider operations spanning a full day or multiple days. With some fine-tuning, an efficient simulation model can be developed to optimize this system.
