The main argument of "A Neolithic revolution? New evidence of diet in the British Neolithic" by Richards and Schulting, is that stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of human bones from the British Neolithic provides evidence for a gradual shift in diet over the course of three thousand years from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic. The authors find a progressive increase in the consumption of crops (C3 resources) and domesticated animals, which were more significant in the diet of Neolithic individuals compared to Mesolithic hunter-gatherers. This incremental dietary change contradicts the traditional notion of the Neolithic revolution as a sudden transition from hunting and gathering to farming. 

The stable isotope analysis in this study provides valuable insights into broad dietary trends across the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in Britain. The results show a gradual uptake of domesticated resources by Neolithic populations, suggesting a slow adaptation to agriculture rather than an abrupt transition. This challenges previous interpretations of the Neolithic revolution as a sudden event and points to a prolonged period of small-scale cultivation and herding. The continuity in diet also indicates sustained foraging activities, demonstrating that domesticated and wild foods were complementary.

However, there are some limitations to the use of stable isotopes in reconstructing past human diets. Stable isotope ratios only provide information about the consumption of certain food groups (e.g. C3 vs C4 plants) but not specific ingredients. The values could be affected by environmental factors and food preparation techniques. Dietary inferences also rely on the assumption that prehistoric and modern plants and animals occupy the same tropic level, which may not be accurate. Sample size and representativeness can affect the reliability of results, as a small number of samples may not capture regional diversity. 

In the study, the small number of samples for each period limits inferences about changes in diet at specific points in time. The results focus on broad trends but more samples are needed to confirm the observed pattern of gradual dietary change. Some periods such as the Early Neolithic are underrepresented, affecting the interpretation of how diets developed over the centuries. Furthermore, the samples were taken from different sites spanning all of Britain, but more localized studies could provide insights into regional variations in the adoption of domesticated resources.

In conclusion, Richards and Schulting present clear evidence for a progressive shift to crop cultivation and animal herding over the course of the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition in Britain. While stable isotope analysis yields important clues about prehistoric diets, the limitations and assumptions of the method must be considered when interpreting results. More research with larger sample sizes and greater resolution is needed to gain a fuller understanding of how Neolithic diets emerged in Britain. Overall, the study challenges notions of the Neolithic revolution as an abrupt change and gives a nuanced view of a gradual adaptation to agricultural lifestyles in prehistoric Britain.
