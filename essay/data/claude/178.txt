Leopold von Ranke is frequently referred to as the “father of scientific history” due to his influential works in the 19th century that established key principles of modern historiography. However, Ranke's methods and approaches did have some shortcomings that prevent him from being considered the sole founder of a truly scientific method of historical study. While Ranke did make seminal contributions that moved history closer to a scientific discipline, his work exhibited some flaws and limitations that other later historians addressed to develop a more robust scientific historiography.   

One of Ranke's most significant contributions was his emphasis on primary sources and objective analysis of historical evidence. Ranke believed that historians should base their work on critical analysis of primary documents and accounts from the era they are studying, rather than speculation or secondary sources. He argued that historians should try to understand the era on its own terms by examining the perspectives and motivations of historical actors from primary records. This focus on evidence and eyewitness testimony was a major step toward a more scientific approach to history.  

However, Ranke's methodology was limited by his narrow selection of sources and evidence. He focused almost exclusively on political and diplomatic history, using records from rulers, governments, and military leaders. His histories largely ignored social, cultural, economic and intellectual dimensions of the periods he studied. By relying only on certain types of evidence from elite groups, Ranke presented an incomplete picture of the past. Later historians built on Ranke's methods but expanded the range of sources to develop a more comprehensive social history. 

In addition, Ranke claimed to take an objective "scientific" approach to history but he exhibited clear biases and subjectivity in his work. While Ranke strove to understand historical periods on their own terms, he was still subject to the prejudices and assumptions of his time. For example, he interpreted the Reformation primarily through a lens of German nationalism. Ranke's histories, while groundbreaking, were not as objectively scientific as he professed. Subsequent historians recognized that pure objectivity is impossible, but aimed to identify and minimize biases through consideration of multiple perspectives and societal contexts.

In conclusion, while Ranke's promotion of primary evidence, objectivity, and understanding history on its own terms were major contributions that moved the field closer to a science, his narrow focus and unacknowledged biases show the limitations of his approach. Ranke should be recognized as a pivotal figure who helped establish scientific principles of historiography, but not as the sole founder of a comprehensive and unbiased scientific method of historical study. His works established the foundations that subsequent historians built upon by broadening the range of evidence, recognizing multiple perspectives, identifying personal biases, and contextualizing historical periods. Through these developments, history evolved into a more complete scientific discipline that Ranke's works inaugurated but did not perfect. Overall, Ranke was a pioneer, but not the "father" of a fully scientific historiography.
