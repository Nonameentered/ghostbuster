Here is a sample 750 word essay in response to the prompt:

The basic Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm provides a way to adaptively estimate the parameters of an Auto-Regressive with Exogenous Input (ARX) model from sampled data. However, the basic RLS algorithm has some limitations, including: 1) It cannot incorporate instrumental variables that are correlated with the regressors but not the error component, and 2) It assumes white noise for the error, while many real systems exhibit noise with autocorrelation that can be better modeled as a moving average process. 

To address the first limitation, the RLS algorithm can be extended to include instrumental variables in a technique known as Pseudo Linear Regression (PLR). In PLR, the instrument variables are included as additional regressors in the ARX model. The RLS algorithm is then applied as usual, but some of the regressors are identified as instrument variables. The key benefit of PLR is that it can produce consistent parameter estimates even when the regressors are correlated with the error, as long as valid instrument variables exist. Comparing PLR to the basic RLS, the PLR estimates will generally have lower bias and mean squared error in the presence of regressor-error correlation.

To address the second limitation, the RLS algorithm can incorporate a moving average (MA) model for the noise instead of assuming white noise. The MA model adds terms with lagged error components as additional regressors. The RLS algorithm is then applied to this augmented model. By including the MA terms, the parameter estimates can account for autocorrelation in the error, leading to lower bias and error in the estimates. However, a drawback is that more data points are required to achieve the same accuracy as the basic RLS due to the increased number of parameters.

In summary, the basic RLS can be enhanced through extensions like PLR to include instrument variables, and by using an MA model in place of white noise to better account for autocorrelated errors. These modifications improve the parameter estimates in the presence of regressor-error correlation and autocorrelated noise, respectively, though at the cost of some additional complexity. By matching the model and estimation technique to the characteristics of the true system, more accurate adaptive parameter estimation can be achieved.
