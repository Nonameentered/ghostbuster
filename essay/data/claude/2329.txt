Augustus, born Gaius Octavius, was the first Roman emperor and ruled from 27 BCE to 14 CE. Following his victory over Mark Antony in the final war of the Roman Republic, Octavius needed to establish himself as the leader of the Roman world. To do so, he employed imagery, mythology, and propaganda to legitimize his power and maintain influence over both the lower classes and aristocracy of Rome.

One of the most effective ways Augustus promoted his authority was by associating himself with Roman mythology and the gods. He claimed descent from the goddess Venus through his adopted father Julius Caesar. By highlighting this divine lineage, Augustus portrayed himself as destined to rule. He also associated himself with Romulus, the mythical founder of Rome. For example, Augustus dedicated statues of Romulus and claimed to have seen Romulus ascend to heaven. This mythical connection allowed Augustus to present himself as a new founder and restorer of Rome. 

Augustus also used religious imagery and titles to reinforce his authority. He adopted the title Augustus, meaning "revered one," which had religious overtones. He also built new temples and lavishly restored old ones, presenting himself as a pious leader favored by the gods. His name and image appeared on coins along with religious symbols, implicitly linking his rule to divine will. This propaganda was effective in gaining the support of both the aristocracy and common people of Rome, who were heavily invested in the religious institutions of the state.

In addition to mythology, Augustus also utilized more direct propaganda to establish control, such as public art and literature. He commissioned Virgil to write the Aeneid, an epic poem that celebrated Augustus' Julian lineage and portrayed him as the destined savior and ruler of Rome. He also completed massive building projects, including the Ara Pacis, the Altar of Peace, which featured images of Augustus and his family. This monument drove home the message that the Augustan era had brought peace and prosperity to Rome after decades of civil war.

Initially, Augustus' propaganda focused on stabilizing his power and gaining popularity. As his rule progressed, however, the messaging shifted to emphasize the longevity and stability of his regime. Public art began to portray Augustus as a wise, elder statesman to make the idea of imperial rule more palatable to aristocrats who valued the republic. Augustus also associated himself more with "roman virtues" like duty, tradition, and family to appeal to conservative senators.   

Though Augustus' propaganda was largely effective, there were some weaknesses. The more direct assertions of divinity were controversial and damaged his popularity at times. The upper classes also still held allegiance to the republic, though many came to accept imperial rule grudgingly over time. Augustus walked a fine line between emphasizing continuity with republican traditions and consolidating his autocratic power. However, by the end of his rule, Augustus had established the Roman Empire on a firm foundation that lasted for centuries, demonstrating the enduring strength and influence of his efforts to legitimize his authority through imagery, myth, and propaganda.
