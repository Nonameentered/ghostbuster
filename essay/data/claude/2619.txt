There are several ethical considerations behind handling and studying human remains for scientific purposes. First and foremost, the dignity and privacy of the individuals must be respected. Their remains should be handled carefully and respectfully at all times. Proper consent should also be obtained from living descendants before remains are studied, when possible. Researchers must consider the cultural and religious beliefs that may govern how human remains should be treated after death. 

Beyond respecting the individuals and their cultural traditions, it is unethical to study human remains for frivolous purposes or to satisfy idle curiosity. The research should have a clear scientific objective that can lead to insights or benefits for the living. Human remains should not be treated as collector's items or spectacle. They represent the remains of a life once lived, and should be valued and studied appropriately.

Experience plays a crucial role in the study of human osteology and the skeleton. An experienced osteologist can glean far more information from a set of remains than an inexperienced researcher. Subtle cues in the skeleton, that may not even seem relevant or meaningful to the untrained eye, can speak volumes to an expert. Experience allows the osteologist to handle remains more skillfully and extract more nuanced information from them. With experience comes a familiarity with anomalous bones or formations that might confuse a less experienced scientist.

In summary, there are clear ethical guidelines around respect, consent, scientific validity and experience that must govern the study of human remains. When practiced ethically and skillfully, the study of human osteology can reveal invaluable insights into how past cultures lived and died. However, remains must be treated with dignity and care at all times out of respect for the individuals they represent. Experience is key to practicing osteology ethically and effectively unlocking the secrets of our skeletal remains.
