The ten decision areas that Hayes and Wheelwright outlined to develop a successful manufacturing strategy are: capacity, facilities, technology, organization structure, job designs, human resources, quality, planning and control, performance measurement, and relationships. For the new lean body shop, these ten areas can be addressed by dividing the overall implementation into three sub-projects: education, layout transformation and six sigma.

The education project will focus on training employees in lean principles and techniques to build the necessary knowledge and skills. This will inform decision areas like job design, human resources and organization structure. The layout transformation project will optimize the layout and flow of the shop floor to enable lean processes. This impacts areas such as capacity, facilities, and planning and control. The six sigma project will improve quality by reducing defects and variability. This project will guide quality, performance measurement, and planning and control decisions.

Appointing senior executives to sponsor these sub-projects will provide leadership and oversight to ensure targets are met. Project managers for each sub-project can then work out the details to execute the necessary changes. For example, the education sponsor can work with managers to determine the scope and content of lean training programs. The layout transformation sponsor can review and approve new shop floor designs. The six sigma sponsor can help set quality objectives and metrics to measure progress.

With strong leadership, a structured approach to implementing change, and a focus on the key decision areas, the manufacturing strategy for the new lean body shop has a good chance of success. Dividing into three sub-projects and allocating oversight and management responsibilities allows for both a holistic, long-term view as well as focused, targeted interventions. This combination will drive education, transformation and optimization of quality - the foundations of a lean manufacturing environment.
