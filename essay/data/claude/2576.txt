Virgil's Aeneid depicts the legendary hero Aeneas as an exemplar of Roman values and virtues, qualities that differ meaningfully from the heroism displayed in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. As Virgil wrote the Aeneid during the reign of Augustus Caesar to help legitimize Roman authority and promote a shared national identity, Aeneas serves as a model for ideal Roman citizenship and epitomizes the qualities of piety, duty, self-sacrifice, and steadfast leadership that Augustus sought to cultivate.

In contrast with Achilles' rage and pride in the Iliad or Odysseus' cunning and trickery in the Odyssey, Aeneas displays an unwavering devotion to duty and obedience to divine will. When Aeneas flees the sack of Troy, he is determined to found a new kingdom in Italy as prophesied by the gods, declaring, “my fate calls me forth to the Latian land...There the house of Aeneas will rule all lands, and his sons' sons, and those born of them.” Aeneas subordinates his personal desires to his destined role in founding Rome. Similarly, in his journey through Carthage and the Underworld, Aeneas follows the commands of deities like Mercury and the Sibyl of Cumae without question. His piety and deference to the gods' authority demonstrate a key Roman virtue that stands in stark relief against the self-centered impulsiveness of Achilles or cunning circumvention of divine will by Odysseus.  

Aeneas also displays a dedication to duty, leadership, and self-sacrifice for the greater good of his people and his destined kingdom. When Dido pleads with him to stay in Carthage, Aeneas responds that "I sail to Italy not of my own free will” and that he must fulfill the “solemn charge” given to him by the gods. He chooses duty over personal happiness and leaves Dido, recognizing his larger responsibility as a leader. This commitment to duty and vision spurs Aeneas to navigate dangerous challenges, from confronting the Cyclops Polyphemus to journeying to the Underworld, all for the sake of his men and his divine mandate. His ability to put aside desires for the sake of purpose echoes the Roman veneration of self-sacrifice, in contrast with the individualistic heroism of Achilles
