Rural Environmental Scientists within the IEEM play an important role in addressing environmental issues specifically affecting the UKâ€™s countryside and rural communities. They apply ecological principles to challenges such as sustainable agriculture, land use change, invasive species management, and pollution control. Many Rural Environmental Scientists work closely with farmers and landowners to develop environmentally-friendly practices. Given the increasing pressures facing rural ecosystems and communities, the work of Rural Environmental Scientists is vital. They help promote thriving and sustainable natural environments in the countryside that balance human activity and development with nature conservation and green spaces.
