The "Golden Age" of economic growth in Europe from 1945 to 1975 benefitted from a combination of factors, including high investment rates, a growing educated workforce, postwar rebuilding, and increasing trade integration. However, Britain experienced slower growth during this period for several reasons. 

Investment in physical and human capital was a key driver of growth during this period. The Marshall Plan provided over $13 billion in aid from the U.S. to help rebuild European infrastructure and industry after WWII, which spurred investment and economic activity. Additionally, high savings and investment rates, aided by wage restraint, allowed for sizable investments in new machinery, technologies, and factories. Education levels also rose substantially, increasing the skill level of the workforce. Rising education and on-the-job training boosted labour productivity and technological innovation.

The supply of labour also grew during this period from greater female participation in the workforce, rural-urban migration, and immigration. Urban populations grew rapidly as people moved into cities for industrial jobs. Migration from southern and eastern Europe also expanded the workforce in western European countries like Britain, France and Germany. While Britain had lower rates of female workforce participation and immigration compared to other European nations, its rural population also moved into cities at a slower pace, limiting labour supply growth. 

Expanding global trade was another significant factor driving growth. Western European countries reduced trade barriers and tariffs through organizations like the European Coal and Steel Community, spurring greater flows of raw materials, foodstuffs, and manufactured goods across the region. Exports like machinery, vehicles, electronics, and appliances grew across western Europe. Britain, however, was less integrated into these trade networks, relying more heavily on trade with its former colonies. This limited Britain's export growth and exposure to competitiveness pressures relative to continental economies. 

Technological progress and transportation improvements revolutionized production and distribution. Advancements included automation, the proliferation of automobiles and modern roads, expanded telephone networks, and commercial air travel. These technologies allowed for higher productivity, the growth of new industries like automobile and aviation manufacturing, and greater connectivity between producers, consumers and trading partners. While Britain lagged in the adoption of certain technologies like automobiles, its road and rail infrastructure also developed more slowly than in other western European countries.

In conclusion, the postwar "Golden Age" of growth in western Europe was spurred by a combination of factors like high investment, an expanding educated workforce, rebuilding aid, growing global trade, and technological and transportation advancements. However, Britain participated less fully in these trends, experiencing slower growth due to weaker investment and labour supply growth, less integration into continental trade networks, slower infrastructure development, and lagging technological adoptionâ€”ultimately limiting its ability to keep pace with its neighboring economies in Europe's prosperous postwar period.
