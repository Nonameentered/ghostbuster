Here is a draft 3250 word essay in response to the prompt:

The Roman poet Tibullus used imagery from military and domestic life in his elegies to convey his love for Delia and reject traditional Roman values of power, status, and wealth. In many of his poems, Tibullus contrasted the simple pleasures of his rural home with Delia with the violence and hardship of the Roman military. This juxtaposition served to highlight what Tibullus saw as the frivolity of seeking power and glory through military conquests. Instead, his poems suggest that true happiness could only be found through a simple, rustic life filled with love. 

One of the most vivid examples of Tibullus contrasting military and domestic life is in Elegy 1.7. In this poem, Tibullus described praying to the gods to protect Delia's brother while he was away on military campaign. Tibullus wrote: "May no long march exhaust him, no fierce enemy frighten him, no sinister bird portend disaster as he goes." The difficulties and dangers of military service are emphasized through images of long marches, frightful enemies, and ill omens. These hardships are contrasted with Tibullus’ wish for Delia's brother to "come home safe, his term of service over, to his sweet sister." The simple pleasures of returning home to family at the end of military service highlights what Tibullus saw as the triviality of seeking glory in war.

Tibullus further rejected traditional Roman values by portraying the country home he shared with Delia as a kind of anti-military camp. In Elegy 1.5, Tibullus described their home as a place free from the trumpet calls, drills, and stern centurions of military life. Instead, Delia acts as the "commander" of their home, and Tibullus follows her orders to celebrate rustic festivals and get drunk on wine. Their little kingdom is depicted as a place of leisure, drunkenness, and play—the opposite of the discipline and hardship of the Roman legion. Through these depictions, Tibullus suggested that real joy was to be found in throwing off the shackles of duty to Rome, retreating into the countryside with one's lover, and living a life of simple pleasures.
