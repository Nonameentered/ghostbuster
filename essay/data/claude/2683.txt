Here is a 2750-word essay comparing the portrayal of women in Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" and Lorca's "Yerma":

The plays "Hedda Gabler" by Henrik Ibsen and "Yerma" by Federico Garc√≠a Lorca both center around female protagonists living in restrictive societies that severely limit their options and freedom. Written in the late 19th and early 20th centuries respectively, the plays offer insight into the societal expectations for and imposed limitations on women during these time periods. 

In Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler," the title character Hedda is a nouveau-riche woman stuck in a loveless marriage of convenience to the uninteresting scholar George Tesman. Having grown up in an aristocratic family, Hedda is accustomed to freedom and luxury, but she has had to marry Tesman due to decreasing social and financial prospects. Hedda resents the domestic life she is confined to, referring to it as a "home" in quotation marks. She longs for beauty, passion, and stimulation, none of which she finds in her current situation.

Hedda feels trapped not only by her marriage but also by the strictures placed on her sex. When her old flame Eilert Lovborg returns to town, she lives vicariously through him and her friend Thea, secretly hoping they will have an affair to break out of their own societal cages. She encourages Lovborg to "be reckless" and "prove what [he's] made of." But ultimately, Hedda is an observer of life, not a participant, due to her gender. She grows increasingly desperate and unstable, manipulating others to disastrous ends as a result.

In Lorca's "Yerma," the female protagonist Yerma also feels constrained by her gender and lot in life. In contrast to Hedda's wealth and status, Yerma lives in poverty with her husband Juan, a sheep herder. Yerma longs for one thing alone: to have a child. Her deepest desire is to fulfill her "womanly" duty of motherhood, but again and again she is unable to conceive, confronting immense frustration and lack of control over her own body and destiny.
