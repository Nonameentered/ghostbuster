Here is a draft 1497 word essay in response to the prompt:

Power is the ability of an actor—whether an individual, group, or institution—to influence the actions and behaviors of others to achieve desired outcomes. Conceptualizations and understandings of power have evolved throughout history along with societies and political systems. Different political theorists have defined power in various ways, focusing on both the means by which it is exercised as well as its outcomes and effects.  

Early theorists like Niccolo Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes focused on power as coercive force and violence. Machiavelli saw power primarily as military and political might and the ability to dominate one's rivals and subjects. Hobbes viewed power as derived from the state's monopoly over the legitimate use of force and violence. In these conceptions, power is imposed from above through threat of punishment and requires compliance and obedience.

Later Enlightenment thinkers conceived of power in more institutional and legal terms. John Locke saw power as granted to the sovereign by free individuals through a social contract. Power was legitimate and lawful when exercised within legal and constitutional limits to protect rights and the public good. Montesquieu built on this by arguing that an separation of powers across institutions was necessary to prevent abuse. In these views, power depends on acceptance and consent, not just force.

19th century thinkers developed more complex analyses of power that accounted for its social and relational dimensions. Karl Marx argued that the ruling classes exert power through control of the modes and means of production to dominate and exploit the proletariat. Power was dialectical and dependent on the compliance of the oppressed. Friedrich Nietzsche suggested power was about psychological and social influences, not just physical force. Power was exercised through culture, knowledge, ideologies and the manipulation of unconscious human drives and instincts.

Contemporary theorists have built on these ideas. Steven Lukes proposed that power is multidimensional, including not just political and economic power but also social and ideological power. Power can be exercised not just through observable conflict but also through the manipulation of desires and beliefs to achieve voluntary compliance. Michel Foucault argued that power is dispersed throughout knowledge systems and discourses in society. Power is productive and shapes subjects, and is not just coercive.

In summary, there are many ways to conceive of power. At its core, power is about the ability to influence and control outcomes, but it can be exercised through force, coercion, authority, manipulation, or the manufacturing of consent. Power depends on a variety of sources, including military might, economic wealth, social status, knowledge, and institutional role.  How power is understood depends on historical and intellectual context, but in all its forms it is central to politics, society, and human relationships. Overall, power remains an elusive and complex concept that political theorists will continue to grapple with.
