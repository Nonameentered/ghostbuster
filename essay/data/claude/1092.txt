Here is a draft 500-word essay in response to the prompt:

The Michelson Interferometer was developed by Albert Michelson in the late 1800s as a tool for measuring the wavelength of light with high precision. It consists of a beam splitter, two mirrors, and a light source that passes light that hits the beam splitter, directing half of the light to one mirror and the other half to the second mirror. The light reflects off the mirrors and recombines at the beam splitter. When the light waves recombine, they can interfere constructively or destructively based on their wavelengths and the optical path lengths between the beam splitter, mirrors, and recombination point. By observing the interference pattern, the wavelength of the light can be calculated from the path length. 

Michelson used the interferometer to make highly accurate measurements of the wavelengths of various monochromatic light sources, including sodium light. By comparing measurements from his interferometer to less precise measurements from diffraction gratings, he showed that the interferometer could measure wavelengths ten times more accurately. The interferometer enabled the creation of more precise standards for units of length based on the wavelength of light.

The interferometer was also used to study the spectra of various light sources. By observing the interference patterns for the different wavelengths of light emitted by a source, the characteristic spectra of the light could be determined with high resolution. Michelson studied the spectra of sunlight, moonlight, and various stars using the interferometer. He was able to observe subtle features in the spectra that had not been seen before with less sensitive instruments. The interferometer enabled breakthrough discoveries in the field of astronomical spectroscopy.

Michelson also used the interferometer to determine the refractive indices of different gases with high precision. By measuring the change in interference patterns when a gas was introduced into one arm of the interferometer, the refractive index of the gas could be calculated based on how much it slowed the speed of light. Michelson studied 25 different gases and produced the most accurate measurements of refractive indices to date. His work provided fundamental insights into the electromagnetic properties of gases that had important implications for physics and engineering.

In summary, the Michelson Interferometer allowed for highly sensitive measurements of light that enabled groundbreaking discoveries in optics, spectroscopy, and the study of matter. Michelson harnessed the interference of light to gain new insights into wavelengths, spectra, refractive indices, and the nature of light itself with unparalleled precision. His ingenious device opened up new frontiers of scientific exploration that changed our understanding of optics, light, and the physical world.
