Here is a 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

The English language has a complex tense system to indicate time. There are three main approaches to analyzing tense in English: the traditional view, the functionalist view, and the structuralist view. The traditional view sees tense as primarily indicating absolute time or the location of a situation in time. In contrast, the functionalist and structuralist views see tense as more closely tied to the syntax of a language than to time itself.  

The traditional view holds that the primary function of tense is to locate a situation in time - either in the past, present, or future. According to this view, the simple past tense (e.g. "ate") refers to situations located in the past. The simple present (e.g. "eat") refers to present situations. And the simple future ("will eat") refers to future situations. This is an intuitive way to think about tense, paralleling our experience of the flow of time. However, there are issues with strictly categorizing tenses this way. For example, the present perfect ("have eaten") seems to refer to the past but has present implications. The traditional view struggles to account for such complex tenses.

Functionalist linguists argue that tense is not simply a matter of time but instead a matter of the relationship between the situation described by a verb and some other situation, which could be the time of speaking or another situation in the discourse. The choice of tense depends on the relationship between these two situations. For example, the simple past is used when the situation being described precedes the time of speaking, while the present perfect connects a past situation to the present. The functionalist view can thus better account for the intricacies of tense usage.

Structuralist linguists focus on the structural or grammatical function of tense. The choice of tense depends on the syntax of the sentence, not time. For example, in subordinate clauses, the tense is determined by the tense of the verb in the main clause, not the actual time being referred to. The rule in English is that a subordinate clause must use the same tense as the main clause. For example, "I knew (simple past) he loved (simple past) me" versus "I know (simple present) he loves (simple present) me." The structuralist view sees tense as primarily a syntactic phenomenon.

In conclusion, there are three main approaches to tense in English that offer different insights. The traditional view sees tense as primarily indicating time, the functionalist view sees tense as indicating the relationship between situations, and the structuralist view sees tense as a syntactic phenomenon. Tense is a complex topic, and its role seems to depend on both time and syntax. All three approaches provide helpful ways of thinking about how tense works in English.
