Here is a draft 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

Andre Gide's novel The Immoralist explores the tension between individual freedom and social responsibility. The protagonist Michel struggles with this tension as he rejects the moral and social norms of early 20th century France in pursuit of personal pleasure and freedom. Marceline, Michel's wife, represents the opposing pole to Michel's radical individualism. Through her character and her relationship with Michel, Gide critiques the extremes of unfettered individualism. 

Marceline is portrayed as a self-sacrificing and dutiful woman. While Michel is eager to cast off social conventions during their extended honeymoon in Algeria, Marceline tries to maintain some sense of propriety and responsibility. She does not fully indulge in the pleasures of the moment like Michel. Even as she comes to appreciate the beauty of North Africa, she worries about how their long absence might inconvenience others. Her ethics are centered on how her actions might affect those around her.

In contrast, Michel views any hindrance to his desires and will as an unjust imposition. He comes to resent Marceline for trying to curb his behavior and for not embracing the pursuit of pleasure with the same fervor as he does. He sees her concerns for ethics and duty as petty annoyances. Michel's radical individualism leads him to neglect Marceline entirely, as he becomes absorbed in his relationship with the boy Bachir while Marceling is ill. 

Through Marceline's suffering and Michel's neglect of her, Gide illustrates the moral bankruptcy of Michel's solipsistic worldview. When Marceline falls ill, Michel is torn away from his hedonistic pursuits, confronted with the consequences of his selfishness. In that moment, he realizes how he has forsaken his ethical duty to his wife in service of his own desires. Marceline's death is the tragic result of Michel's belief that he could ignore social bonds and responsibilities in pursuit of his own freedom and pleasure.

Ultimately, Gide suggests through Marceline's character that unfettered individual freedom comes at the cost of neglecting one's duty to others. Through her suffering, death, and Michel's role in both, Gide shows how radical individualism can lead to a frighteningly amoral solipsism. Marceline represents the moral anchor that Michel loses, demonstrating Gide's view that individual freedom requires a sense of responsibility and care for others. Overall, Gide uses the character of Marceline and her tragic fate to mount a critique of extreme notions of individual liberty that ignore social ethics.
