The Copas turkey enterprise currently has a successful business selling high-quality, free range turkeys to butchers and directly to customers in the local area. However, there are several opportunities for the partnership to expand their market share while maintaining their high standards. To begin, the partnership could expand beyond their local region by establishing relationships with butchers and specialty food stores in nearby cities and towns. The demand for high-quality, free range and organic meat products is increasing, especially in more affluent areas. By building partnerships with stores in these locations, Copas could increase their sales significantly during the busy holiday season without sacrificing their standards or upsetting current customers. 

Another opportunity would be for Copas to utilize online and social media platforms to reach new customers and sell directly. Many smaller farms and food producers have found success connecting with environmentally-conscious customers through social media and selling goods on their own website or third-party sites like Etsy and Shopify. Copas could promote their turkeys on platforms like Instagram and Facebook to raise brand awareness beyond their local community and make it easy for customers across the region or country to order turkeys. Selling online may upset some current butcher partners, so Copas would need to be very transparent about this new sales channel to maintain good relationships. However, online sales could provide another revenue stream during their off-season.

Speaking of the off-season, the empty farm buildings present an ideal opportunity for Copas to generate income outside of the turkey season. Options could include hosting educational farm tours and workshops on topics like small-scale farming, butchering, or country crafts. Copas could also rent out space to small craft producers, such as local cheesemakers, bakers, or brewers. During spring and summer, the farm could host events like farm-to-table dinners, weddings, or food and music festivals. These community-building events and educational experiences would allow Copas to generate revenue during months when the farm is not in use for turkey production.      

In summary, Copas has many exciting opportunities to expand their market share and utilization of farm resources. However, with expansion comes the challenge of managing growth in a sustainable way that does not compromise the quality of their product or relationships with partners and community stakeholders. With open communication, transparency and a continued commitment to their high standards of quality and service, the Copas partnership can find success with these new opportunities and build an even stronger, more resilient business. Consistency and patience will be key. But by diversifying their sales channels, expanding their geographic reach, and making better use of the farm during off-season months, Copas can grow their turkey enterprise into a successful four-season operation.
