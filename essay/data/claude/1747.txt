Robert Venturi's 1991 Sainsbury Wing extension to the National Gallery in London was inspired by and incorporated numerous historical references and design influences. Venturi was known for embracing historical styles and recontextualizing them in postmodern designs. His National Gallery extension is no exception. 

One of the most direct influences on the Sainsbury Wing design was the existing National Gallery building, designed in a neoclassical style by William Wilkins in 1832. Venturi wanted his new addition to complement the old gallery, so he borrowed heavily from the neoclassical style and elements like columns, pediments, and symmetry. However, Venturi's use of these elements was more ornamental and exaggerated, reflecting his postmodern approach. The façade of the Sainsbury Wing features a triangular pediment supported by oversized Corinthian columns. The columns are stripped of their usual architectural purpose and become more sculptural. This exaggerated use of historical forms to create ornament is a hallmark of Venturi's postmodern style.

The interior of the Sainsbury Wing also references historical styles, especially Renaissance and Baroque architecture. The ceilings reference 17th-century Baroque ceilings like those at the Palazzo Farnese. The coffered ceiling of one room in the Sainsbury Wing directly quotes a ceiling in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome. The wall elevations, door surrounds, and other details also borrow from the Renaissance and Baroque periods in Italy, reinterpreted through Venturi's postmodern lens. Venturi took inspiration from Warburg Institute founder Aby Warburg's theories on Renaissance architecture and incorporated Renaissance-era forms and geometries into his design. The grand staircase in the Sainsbury Wing, for example, was inspired by stairs in Renaissance-era buildings Venturi had studied.

Venturi was also influenced by Mannerist and Baroque-era artists like Giorgio Vasari, Vignola, and Borromini. The exaggerated, distorted, and ornamental use of columns and pediments on the façade has similarities to Mannerist architecture. The complex geometries of the windows also reflect Borromini's work. The façade combines references to multiple historical periods, reflecting Venturi's view of "both-and" rather than "either-or." This multiplicity of historical references in one design was a defining characteristic of postmodern architecture and Venturi's approach.

In sum, the influences and inspirations on Venturi's design for the Sainsbury Wing were diverse but centered on Italian Renaissance, Mannerist and Baroque architecture. Venturi reinterpreted elements from these historical periods in an exaggerated and ornamental postmodern style. By combining multiple historical references in a single building, Venturi's Sainsbury Wing design reflected his belief that postmodern architecture could embrace "both-and" rather than "either-or." The result is a playful yet cohesive design that complements its neoclassical neighbor while still marking its time as a thoroughly postmodern work.
