Here is a draft 2000-word essay in response to the prompt:

New Religious Movements (NRMs), commonly referred to as "cults" in the latter half of the twentieth century, were viewed as unusually prolific and disturbing by some. Several NRMs arose that were seen as radical or unorthodox in their beliefs and practices by mainstream society. This led to the growth of an "anti-cult movement" composed of ex-members, parents, and others who believed NRMs were dangerous or even violent. These groups argued that "cult" members were "brainwashed" and incapable of thinking critically about the group they had joined. 

The emergence of several high-profile NRMs led to moral panics that they were coercing members to act violently. The mass suicide of members of the People's Temple in Jonestown, Guyana brought the potential dangers of NRMs to the public eye. Other groups like the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas and Heaven's Gate also received widespread notoriety for violent acts. Although these were isolated incidents, the media and anti-cult movements frequently portrayed them as representative of the dangers of NRMs as a whole. They argued for legal and social restrictions on the activities of NRMs based on brainwashing and thought control theories.

Central to many of the controversies surrounding NRMs was the belief in "brainwashing." Cults were accused of subjecting members to psychological manipulation and control to the point they could not think for themselves. The popular assumption was that brainwashing could compel otherwise normal individuals to behave in radical or even violent ways. However, the scientific community largely rejects brainwashing theories, finding little evidence that it can override individuals' free will. 

Anti-cult groups also believed that NRMs with unorthodox theologies were disruptive to society. Groups like the Unification Church, Hare Krishnas, and Scientology received criticism and even harassment due to beliefs seen as bizarre or threatening to mainstream Christian values. While cults have historically been seen as threatening during times of cultural change, many argued that the anti-cult movement went too far in infringing on religious freedom.

The media also frequently portrayed NRMs in a sensationalistic manner. Coverage of groups like Heaven's Gate focused on members' strange beliefs and practices rather than the complex realities of why individuals were drawn to and remained in such groups. This contributed to a simplistic public view of cult members as mentally unstable or deficient in some way. The media also uncritically promoted brainwashing theories to explain people's involvement in NRMs. All of these factors led cults to be viewed as inevitably violent and dangerous, though social science research suggests NRMs are no more likely to be violent than other groups.

In conclusion, NRMs faced opposition in the latter twentieth century due to perceived threats to mainstream society and sensationalistic media coverage. Anti-cult movements and moral panics depicted cults as coercive, their members as brainwashed victims, and violence as the inevitable result of their unorthodox beliefs. However, most social scientists argue these views are overly simplistic and not supported by evidence. NRMs are diverse, complex social groups that deserve to be evaluated based on facts rather than speculation and fearmongering.
