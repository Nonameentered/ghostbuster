The two most common methods for determining the concentration of iron in a drink are the calibration plot method and the standard addition method. In the calibration plot method, a series of standard solutions with known concentrations of iron are analyzed to develop a calibration curve relating the analytical signal, such as the absorbance of light,  to the iron concentration. The absorbance of the unknown sample is then measured and compared to the curve to determine its concentration. The standard addition method involves adding known amounts of iron to several aliquots of the unknown sample, then comparing the differences in analytical signal between the aliquots to calculate the original iron concentration. Of these two methods, the standard addition method is more effective for determining iron concentration because it corrects for matrix effects and does not require an extensive set of calibration standards.

To implement either method, atomic absorption spectroscopy is commonly used to measure the absorbance of light by the iron analyte. In this technique, a flame composed of a fuel gas and oxidant is used to atomize the iron in the sample into free atoms. A hollow cathode lamp or electrodeless discharge lamp emits light that contains the characteristic absorption wavelengths for iron. As the light passes through the flame, some is absorbed by the free iron atoms. By Beer's Law, the amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of iron atoms. The flame is usually between 2100 to 3200°C to fully atomize the iron.  

For a given sample of an iron-fortified orange juice drink with an unknown concentration of iron, the formula provided indicates there is 21.42 mg of Ammonium ferric citrate per 8 ounce serving, which provides 6 mg of elemental iron. If the sample size used in the atomic absorption analysis is 5 mL, and the density of the orange juice is 1.05 g/mL, then the amount of Ammonium ferric citrate in the sample can be calculated as 21.42 mg * (5 mL / 240 mL) * (1.05 g/mL / 1000 mg/g) = 0.0438 mg. Since Ammonium ferric citrate is approximately 33% iron by mass, the amount of iron in the 5 mL sample is 0.0438 mg * (6 mg Fe / 21.42 mg compound) = 0.13 mg or 130 μg. Therefore, the concentration of iron in the orange juice sample is 130 μg / 5 mL = 26 μg/mL or 0.026 mg/mL. 

In summary, of the calibration plot method and standard addition method, the standard addition method is more effective for determining the concentration of iron in a drink because it accounts for potential matrix effects in the sample and does not require making calibration standards. Atomic absorption spectroscopy can be used to analyze the iron by atomizing the sample in a flame and measuring the amount of light absorbed by the free iron atoms. For an orange juice sample, these techniques allowed calculating an iron concentration of 0.026 mg/mL based on the formula and properties provided.
