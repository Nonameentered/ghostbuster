Virgil's epic poem the Aeneid chronicles the legendary journey of Aeneas, a Trojan hero who travels from Troy to Italy to found Rome. Aeneas is portrayed as the ultimate Roman hero, reflecting Virgil's purpose in writing the Aeneid to exalt the greatness of Rome and its first emperor, Augustus. 

Aeneas displays several characteristics of Roman heroism throughout the poem that legitimize him as a heroic founder of Rome. Firstly, Aeneas shows immense courage and strength in battle. When the Greeks sack Troy, Aeneas fights valiantly to defend the city, even after it is clear they have lost. He slays many Greek warriors, showing his prowess as a fighter. Aeneas continues to show courage as he leads his people on their journey to Italy, defending them against Harpies, storms, and enemy attacks. Aeneas's courage establishes him as a great warrior worthy of founding Rome.

Secondly, Aeneas shows dutifulness to his divine destiny, which is to found Rome. Although he is heartbroken when forced to flee Troy, he obeys the commands of his mother Venus and the gods that he must find a new home for his people. Aeneas dutifully sets sail for Hesperia, showing resolve and leadership. When tempted by pleasurable distractions like Dido and Carthage, Aeneas stays focused on his mission. His sense of duty makes him a model leader deserving of the Roman throne.  

Thirdly, Aeneas displays key virtues of piety, mercy, and justice. He is immensely pious, always respecting and obeying the gods. Aeneas shows mercy, for example when he spares Helen after the fall of Troy. His mercy and just nature are shown when he holds funeral games to honor his late father, and comforts his people in times of despair. These virtues establish Aeneas as a wise, compassionate leader who can found a virtuous civilization like Rome.

In conclusion, Virgil portrays Aeneas as the epitome of Roman heroism - courageous, dutiful, and virtuous. By founding Rome through these admirable qualities, Aeneas justifies Rome's status as a grand empire and Augustus as its heroic first emperor, fulfilling Virgil's goal in the Aeneid to glorify Rome. Through Aeneas's journey, Virgil captures the glory of Rome's history and destiny.
