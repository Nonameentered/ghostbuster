Here is a 753-word essay response to the prompt:

The purpose of this experiment was to determine the distribution of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase in three subcellular compartments: mitochondria, microsomes, and cytosol. Succinate dehydrogenase is an enzyme  involved in cellular respiration and the citric acid cycle. It converts succinate to fumarate, generating considerable energy for the cell in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). 

Given the importance of succinate dehydrogenase in cellular metabolism and energy production, determining its localization within the cell is critical to understand how it functions. The researchers hypothesized that succinate dehydrogenase would be found primarily in the mitochondria, since that organelle is the site of the citric acid cycle and most cellular respiration. They further predicted little to no succinate dehydrogenase activity in the microsomes and cytosol.

To test their hypotheses, the researchers obtained tissue samples from rats and performed subcellular fractionation using differential centrifugation to isolate mitochondria, microsomes, and cytosol. They then measured the specific activity of succinate dehydrogenase in each fraction using a spectrophotometric assay. The specific activity measures the rate of product formation by the enzyme per milligram of protein. Higher specific activity indicates a greater amount of the enzyme, relative to other proteins, in that subcellular compartment.

The results showed that succinate dehydrogenase had the highest specific activity in the mitochondrial fraction, at 5.16 μmoles/minute/mg protein. This finding supported the researchers' hypothesis that most of the enzyme would be found in the mitochondria. In contrast, the microsomal fraction had a specific activity of only 0.38 μmoles/minute/mg protein, while the cytosolic fraction measured 0.05 μmoles/minute/mg protein. These very low activities indicate that little succinate dehydrogenase was present outside the mitochondria.

In summary, the purpose of the experiment was to determine the subcellular distribution of the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase in rat tissue samples. The results clearly showed that succinate dehydrogenase was predominantly located within mitochondria, with very little activity in the microsomes and cytosol. This finding suggests that succinate dehydrogenase plays its primary role in the citric acid cycle and cellular respiration within the mitochondria, the main site of energy production in cells. The low activities outside the mitochondria imply that succinate dehydrogenase has little function in those other subcellular compartments. Overall, the experiment achieved its aim to characterize the localization of this key metabolic enzyme.
