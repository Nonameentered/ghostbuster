Designing an effective low-cost barcode reader system for a store requires balancing several factors: customer efficiency, low cost, and customer satisfaction. A system that is too slow or fails too often will annoy customers and reduce efficiency, while an overly expensive system may not provide enough additional value to justify the cost.  

The most important factor to consider is how quickly and accurately the system can read product barcodes and look up the associated price and product information. Slow or inaccurate reads will increase the time customers spend waiting in line and reduce the number of customers that can be served. For a low-cost system, using basic laser scanners and lookup tables stored locally on the system is likely sufficient for most small stores. More advanced imagers and network connections to a centralized database could improve speed and accuracy but also increase costs. A system should aim to read barcodes and lookup product information in under 3 to 5 seconds for most items to balance efficiency and cost.

Another key factor is ensuring a high uptime and low failure rate for the system. Any downtime where barcode readers or point-of-sale terminals are not functioning will bring sales and customer checkout to a halt, significantly impacting revenue and customer satisfaction. For a low-cost system, using proven, stable components and software and avoiding bleeding-edge technologies can help maximize uptime. A system should aim for at least 95-99% uptime to balance reliability and cost. Redundant components and network connectivity where possible can also help reduce downtime in the event of failures.

The physical design and ergonomics of the system are also important for customer satisfaction. Barcode scanners and displays should be intuitive to use and positioned so that both the customer and cashier can see and interact with them. A touchscreen interface for selecting payment options and signing can also speed checkout and provide a more modern experience, though at higher cost. Checkout counter space is often limited, so components should have a small footprint. 

For a low-cost barcode reader system, using affordable laser scanners, local data lookup, stable and proven components, and an intuitive physical design can achieve good results for customer efficiency, low cost, and satisfaction. Higher-end imagers, networking, redundancy, and touchscreen interfaces can provide incremental benefits but risk significantly increasing the total system cost for limited gains. With a balanced approach, such a system can minimize wait times, downtime, and checkout hassle for customers while keeping the total cost affordable for most stores.
