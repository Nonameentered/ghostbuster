Here is a draft 1250 word essay in response to the prompt:

A dietary survey is a method of quantifying food and nutrient intake in a population through surveys of individuals. Participants will report details of all the foods and beverages they have consumed over a given period of time, and nutritionists can then analyze the nutritional content of the intake based on standard food composition databases. Dietary surveys are important in assessing the relationship between diet and disease as they provide insights into how nutritional intake aligns with recommended intakes and may influence health outcomes. For example, a dietary survey may reveal inadequate intake of certain nutrients that are protective against chronic diseases or excessive intake of nutrients that may promote disease.

One method for conducting dietary surveys is the weighed food intake approach, where participants weigh and record all foods consumed before eating, then report the details to the researchers. The advantages of this method are that it provides a high level of detail and precision in quantifying food intake. However, it is labor-intensive, requires high participant burden, and changes in eating behaviors may occur when food is weighed before consumption. An alternative method is multiple pass 24-hour dietary recall interviews, where participants recall and describe all meals consumed in the past 24 hours to an interviewer. This reduces participant burden but relies on memory and estimations, providing less precision.

A dietary survey conducted by the author involving 24-hour dietary recalls of 100 participants provided insight into energy and nutrient levels. The average daily energy intake was 9100 kilojoules, lower than the estimated average energy expenditure of 10,000 kilojoules required to maintain weight stability. Intakes of protein (96 grams), carbohydrates (271 grams), and fats (89 grams) were within recommended ranges. Calcium, iron and zinc intakes were below recommended levels, while sodium intake exceeded recommendations. Vitamin intakes were generally adequate. These findings suggest some areas of the diet could be improved to better support health and wellbeing.

These findings were consistent with other dietary surveys showing inadequate mineral and excess sodium intakes in this population. However, energy and macronutrient intakes were higher than other studies. Possible explanations for differences could be variations in sampling, data collection methods, or inadvertent changes in eating patterns during the survey period. Dietary intakes also vary geographically based on the availability and cultural preferences of foods. Overall, dietary surveys provide a methodology to evaluate dietary intakes against recommendations to identify potential risks or areas for improvement to support optimal nutrition and health outcomes in a population. With consistency in methods and considering contextual factors, dietary surveys can be useful for tracking changes in dietary trends over time or the impact of interventions on dietary habits.
