There are several archaeological examples that provide evidence for deliberate Neanderthal burials. One of the earliest examples was discovered in 1960 at Le Moustier, France. The remains of a Neanderthal child were found in a pit, associated with stone tools and the bones of a woolly rhinoceros. The body was positioned with its head facing east, surrounded by horncores of the rhino. This intentional burial of the child hints at an awareness of mortality and possibly ritual among Neanderthals.  

Another example comes from Shanidar Cave, Iraq, where a 50- to 60-year-old adult male Neanderthal, known as "Shanidar 1," was discovered in the early 20th century. His remains showed the earliest evidence of mortuary behavior - he was covered with flower pollen, suggesting that he was interred with wildflowers, likely as part of a ceremony.

More recent research has reinforced these initial findings. In 2017, researchers evaluated 17 known Neanderthal burials and found that most showed signs of intentionality, like placement in a pit, use of ochre, or body positioning. For example, in La Ferrassie, France, two infants were found together and had been sprinkled with ochre, while in Spain, aNeanderthal at Sima de las Palomas had been buried in a deep pit. 

These burials suggest that Neanderthals recognized death as the end of life and may have had beliefs in an afterlife. The placement of objects with the bodies also hints at nascent symbolic thinking. While some scholars argue that Neanderthal burials mimicked those of contemporary humans, proponents counter that deliberate burials emerged independently among Neanderthals, representing a shared "mortuary impulse" with humans. Both species may have developed symbolic capacities allowing for ritual treatment of the dead.

In summary, recent analyses of several Neanderthal burials, especially those of Shanidar 1, the Le Moustier child, and the La Ferrassie infants, provide evidence that Neanderthals intentionally interred their dead. The positioning of bodies, use of grave goods, and other signs like the Shanidar 1 pollen suggest these burials were ritualistic and imbued with symbolic meaning for Neanderthals. Most experts interpret these burials as demonstrating Neanderthals' sophisticated cognitive abilities, including awareness of mortality, spirituality, and perhaps even views of an afterlife. The examples show that mortuary behavior emerged early in human evolution and was not unique to our species.
