The estrogen receptor (ER) is a protein found inside cells that binds the hormone estrogen. When estrogen binds ER, it activates the receptor, allowing it to alter the expression of genes within the cell. The estrogen receptor thus acts as a receptor-mediated gene transcription factor. There are two main forms of the estrogen receptor—ER alpha and ER beta—which are encoded by different genes but have similar structures. Both consist of distinct functional regions:

The ligand binding domain is where estrogen physically binds to the receptor. When estrogen binds, it causes a conformational change in the receptor that activates its gene regulatory functions. The DNA binding domain contains zinc fingers that directly bind to estrogen response elements in the DNA. These are specific DNA sequences that ER recognizes and binds to in order to regulate gene expression. The hinge region provides flexibility between the other domains. The transactivation domain interacts with other proteins to actually activate or repress transcription of target genes.

 When estrogen binds ER, the receptor dimerizes, meaning two ER proteins join together. The dimer then binds to an estrogen response element in the DNA, altering the expression of the associated gene. The ER can activate gene transcription, increasing mRNA and protein production. Alternatively, ER can recruit co-repressor proteins that decrease gene transcription. Which genes are activated or repressed depends on which co-regulators are present in that cell type.

Through these mechanisms, estrogen signaling via ER regulates expression of hundreds of genes across tissues in the body. In reproductive tissues, ER controls genes involved in development, proliferation, and maturation. In bone, ER regulates genes involved in bone remodeling and maintenance. In the brain, ER influences genes involved in cognition, mood, and neuroprotection. Dysregulation of ER signaling has been implicated in diseases such as breast cancer, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, and depression.

In summary, the estrogen receptor is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates diverse physiological processes in humans. Its structure consists of distinct domains that allow it to bind estrogen, bind DNA, and activate or repress gene transcription. By controlling expression of many target genes, ER mediates the widespread effects of estrogen in both reproductive and non-reproductive tissues.
