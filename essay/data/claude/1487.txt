Accor is one of the largest hotel groups in the world with over 5,200 hotels in 110 countries. Over the past five years, Accor has undertaken significant changes to adapt to major trends impacting the hospitality industry. The key trends that Accor has responded to include the rise of digital technologies, increasing demand for more sustainable practices, growth in the luxury hotel segment, and changing guest expectations for more unique and personalized experiences.

To adapt to the rise of digital technologies, Accor has invested heavily in its digital capabilities. It launched the Accor Live Limitless loyalty program in 2019 which provides guests with a personalized digital experience before, during and after their stay. The program uses data and artificial intelligence to provide customized recommendations and offers to guests. Accor has also introduced mobile check-in and check-out, smart rooms with automated lighting and temperature controls, and a global distribution system to increase online booking. These digital initiatives have been critical to improving the guest experience and driving additional revenue.  

Accor has also focused on becoming an industry leader in environmental and social sustainability. It launched the Planet 21 program in 2016 which includes 21 commitments to sustainable development, including reducing energy and water consumption, decreasing waste, and promoting healthy and sustainable food. Many hotels have installed solar panels, transitioned to renewable energy sources, banned single-use plastics, and created urban gardens. Accor aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. These sustainability initiatives appeal to eco-conscious guests and investors, helping Accor achieve a competitive advantage.

In recent years, Accor has expanded in the luxury hotel market through acquisitions and partnerships. In 2016, Accor acquired FRHI Hotels & Resorts which includes the Fairmont, Raffles and Swissôtel brands. Accor also formed a joint venture with Banyan Tree Holdings in 2017 to develop and manage Banyan Tree branded hotels. Accor now has over 120 luxury and premium hotels, catering to affluent guests seeking high-end accommodation and personalized service. The luxury segment represents a high-growth, high-margin opportunity for Accor.

Finally, Accor has adapted to changing guest expectations by providing authentic local experiences and customized services. Many hotels have embraced the local history, culture, art, food, and social scene of their surroundings. Accor’s new lifestyle brands including Jo&Joe, Greet, and Tribe promote social interaction between guests and connection to local communities. Additionally, the Accor Live Limitless program uses data analytics to tailor services, amenities, and offers to individual guests based on their preferences and past behavior.  

Going forward, Accor will likely continue to pursue its key strategies of enhancing the digital experience, leading in sustainability, expanding its luxury brands, and delivering unique lifestyle experiences. Accor has demonstrated an ability to adapt to industry changes and is well positioned to succeed based on its critical success factors of brand portfolio, global scale, partnerships, and customer loyalty. While the hospitality industry faces uncertainty in the coming years, Accor has a robust business model and space of possibilities to maintain its performance and competitive advantage.
