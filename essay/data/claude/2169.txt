Here is a 2750 word essay in response to the prompt:

Aeschylus employs vivid imagery throughout the Oresteia trilogy to represent key themes of revenge, justice, and motherhood. In the first play, Agamemnon, Aeschylus uses imagery of blood and sacrifice to portray the cycle of vengeance. The play opens with a Watchman noticing a beacon signaling that the Greek army has sacked Troy. However, instead of rejoicing at the victory, the Watchman laments “sing the dirge...the house reeks of blood-dripping slaughter” (lines 17-19). The use of the imagery of blood and slaughter foreshadows the violence and death that is to come in the play, specifically the murder of Agamemnon by his wife Clytemnestra in revenge for the sacrifice of their daughter Iphigenia. The "reek" and "dripping" create a visceral sense of the bloody vengeance that stains the house of Atreus.

When Agamemnon returns, Clytemnestra greets him with false hospitality, telling him to “let not your foot, my lord, profane the sea's fair offspring, purple dye” (line 958). However, the "purple dye" is actually a dark red carpet, stained with the blood of sacrifices. The literal blood-red carpet symbolizes the bloody vengeance about to unfold. When Clytemnestra murders Agamemnon, she declares "your death is your atonement" (line 1380), indicating she sees the act as one of just revenge for the death of Iphigenia. The cycle of violence is embodied in the recurring blood imagery. 

In The Libation Bearers, Orestes is spurred by his sister Electra to avenge their father's death by killing their mother Clytemnestra. However, Orestes is torn by the dilemma of matricide. When he pours libations at his father's tomb, a lock of hair signifies his mourning but also his desire for vengeance. He says the hair is "a suppliant for me, a pleader for the dead - dumb, yet eloquent" (lines 94-95). The hair is a poignant symbol, both mute yet powerfully conveying Orestes' obligation to avenge his father.  

Yet after Orestes kills Clytemnestra, the Furies appear, demanding punishment for the matricide. The Furies are vengeful deities who hunt down kin-slayers, representing the moral law that forbids matricide. They are described as “black and utterly revolting...disgorging from their eyes a thick dark blood” (lines 1048-1053). The black, bloody, and revolting Furies are chilling embodiments of vengeance and reminders of the unnatural violence of Orestes' act.

In The Eumenides, Orestes flees from the Furies' wrath to Athens, where Athena establishes the first homicide trial to determine his guilt. By the end of the trial, the Furies are transformed into the Eumenides, benevolent deities who accept Athena's rule of law. Athena persuades the Furies to embrace justice instead of endless vengeance. She tells them to make Athens' soil “a place of refuge of reverence” (line 778) - a haven protected by lawful trials instead of blood feuds.

In conclusion, Aeschylus employs the recurring motifs of blood, slaughter, death, and darkness to represent the violent cycles of vengeance in the Oresteia. Yet through the resolution of the Orestes' trial, Aeschylus suggests that justice and law can supplant vengeance. The defeat of the bloody Furies by Athena's court signifies the triumph of civilization over barbarism. Aeschylus thus explores the possibility of progress from a primitive ethic of vengeance toward one of democracy, justice, and civic order.
