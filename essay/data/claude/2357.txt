Here is a draft 2500-word essay in response to the prompt:

Economic anthropologists have taken several approaches to studying pre-capitalist exchange mechanisms and transactions in small-scale societies. Some of the major approaches include formalist, substantivist, and Marxist perspectives. However, each approach has been subject to various criticisms. This essay will outline the main approaches, discuss some of the key criticisms, and analyze case studies of exchange practices in aboriginal New Guinea and northwest Native American societies to demonstrate how these perspectives can shed light on pre-capitalist transactions.  

The formalist perspective, advocated by scholars like George Dalton, views pre-capitalist exchange as aimed at maximizing individual gains and achieving equilibrium. Exchanges are seen as taking place in an impersonal, self-regulating market. However, substantivists argue that this perspective ignores the social and cultural context of transactions in small communities. Substantivists like Karl Polanyi see exchange as embedded within social relationships and aimed at building alliances and solidarity, rather than maximizing profits. Exchanges strengthen community ties and redistribute resources to those in need.  

Marxist anthropologists like Maurice Godelier build on substantivism but emphasize how transactions are shaped by power relations and disputes over the control of surplus. They see exchange as a means for the ruling class to extract labor and goods from producers. However, Marxist perspectives have been criticized for overemphasizing conflict and ignoring cooperation. They also often rely on unilinear cultural evolutionism in which societies progress through stages from "primitive" to "advanced."

New Guinea highlanders provide an example of a pre-capitalist society where transactions were embedded in kinship and political alliances. Exchanges of pigs, shell valuables, and other goods were used to build alliances for defense and enhance prestige. The kula ring of coastal peoples involved the ceremonial exchange of armbands and necklaces to establish trade partnerships and friendships. However, some argue these exchanges also allowed "big men" to gain power over others by controlling the circulation of valuables.

Among northwest Native Americans like the Kwakiutl, potlatches were ceremonial distributions of goods that established the prestige and rank of chiefs. They were "contests of property" where chiefs vied to give away the most wealth. While these strengthened alliances and kin ties, some see them as a means for elites to assert dominance. The gifts were often paid back with interest, creating debt obligations. However, others argue that status was achieved by giving away property, not accumulating it.

In conclusion, there are diverse perspectives on pre-capitalist transactions with reasonable criticisms of each view. However, case studies show that in small-scale societies, exchange was primarily aimed at building social and political relationships to benefit communities, rather than maximizing individual profits. Transactions reinforced norms of sharing and reciprocity while also allowing ambitious individuals to gain influence over others. Exchange was deeply embedded within the cultural and social contexts of each community. Analyzing pre-capitalist exchange thus requires a nuanced perspective that incorporates elements of substantivist, Marxist, and cultural approaches.
