Here is a 1000-word essay with five paragraphs responding to your prompt:

There are three mainstream types of photovoltaic (PV) technologies: monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film. Monocrystalline panels are the most efficient but also the most expensive. They are made of single crystals of silicon, which means the atoms are precisely aligned to allow electrons to flow freely. Polycrystalline panels are made of multiple crystals of silicon and are slightly less efficient but cheaper to produce. Thin-film panels use little to no silicon and are the least efficient and cheapest type. 

For a school, the choice between these types depends on factors like budget, space constraints, and the goal of the project. Monocrystalline panels would require the fewest panels to reach a given system size, but they are the most expensive. Polycrystalline and thin-film options require more panels for the same output but at lower cost. Government grants, rebates, and tax incentives can help fund renewable energy projects. The US Department of Energy offers grants for schools, and the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) provides a 26% tax credit. Some states also have additional incentives for solar.

Installing PV panels on a tilted canopy roof and accounting for shade from trees introduces some challenges. The tilted roof means panels cannot be flush-mounted and may require additional racking equipment to create an angle optimized for sun exposure. Nearby trees will cast shade at certain times and solar trackers or optimizers can help mitigate energy losses from shading. Removing or trimming trees should be a last resort. Using modeling tools like PVSYST and RETscreen can help evaluate these factors.

PVSYST and RETscreen are the two most popular solar design and modeling programs. PVSYST is more commonly used by installers and engineers, offering 3D design capabilities and accuracy within 5% of actual system performance. RETscreen is a stripped-down tool aimed at initial feasibility assessment, with accuracy around 10-15% of actual system performance. PVSYST requires more advanced technical knowledge to operate. For a school exploring PV options, RETscreen may be simpler to use in early planning, but PVSYST would provide a more precise estimate of expected system output or savings.

In summary, for a school, the choice of PV technology and modeling tools depends on balancing cost, performance, and complexity. Monocrystalline panels are the most efficient but expensive, while thin-film panels are cheapest but least efficient. Government funding can help offset costs. Installing on a tilted canopy roof and accounting for shading requires extra design considerations. PV modeling tools like PVSYST and RETscreen can evaluate options, with PVSYST offering the highest design precision for final system plans. By weighing these factors, a school can determine an optimal plan for their renewable energy project.
