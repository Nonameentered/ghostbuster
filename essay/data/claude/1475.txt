Throughout his works, Edgar Allan Poe employs dark settings to create a sense of unease, anxiety, and even terror in his readers. These settings are typically remote, isolated, and detached from society. By removing his characters and readers from the familiar and into the strange and obscure, Poe creates psychological terror and reflects themes of alienation and loss of control that were prevalent anxieties in early 19th century American culture.  

In Poe's famous poem "The Raven," the narrator begins by noting that "once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, / Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore."  The late night setting, combined with the weariness and isolation of the narrator, immediately establishes a mood of suspense and dread. The narrator is detached from others in the dead of night, with only his ancient and esoteric books as strange company. The raven's ominous entrance into this scene only amplifies the anxiety and fear coursing through the poem, with its refrain reminding us of loss and death: "Nevermore."

Similarly, Poe's tales often unfold in isolated settings that reflect the era's societal unease. For example, "The Fall of the House of Usher" is set in a crumbling abbey in a remote location, almost completely cut off from the outside world. The abbey reflects the declining mental states of Roderick and Madeline Usher, while its distance from society reflects their complete estrangement from others. The story's ominous conclusion, with the abbey fragmented and collapsed into the tarn, reflects the total breakdown of reason and order. The abrupt disappearance of this place of phobia and psychosis provides a metaphor for the instability of the era.

Even stories set in less obviously Gothic settings, like "The Tell-Tale Heart," evoke anxiety through isolation and madness. The narrator lives alone with the old man, and his descending into murderous madness reflects a loss of order and control, made all the eerier given the otherwise ordinary setting. His insistence that he heard the old man's heart beating reflects a psychosis that threatens stability from within the familiar and everyday.

In Poe's time, American society was experiencing the disorienting effects of modernization and social change. There were increasing anxieties over loss of tradition, isolation, and madnessâ€”all of which Poe's works reflect and embody through their eerie and obscure settings. His poems and tales gave the familiar and everyday world a touch of terror that resonated with readers. Poe's works remain unsettling today because psychosis and societal anxieties are still part of human existence, and always will be. The obscure and isolated settings Poe employed tapped into primal human fears that still emerge when we find ourselves detached from the familiar, surrounded by the strange and eerie. In that sense, Poe was a master of crafting tales for the ages, not just his own.
