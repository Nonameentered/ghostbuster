The post-processual and critical theory approaches are two divergent perspectives that developed in archaeology starting in the 1980s. Barbara Bender takes a post-processual approach that emphasizes the subjectivity and plurality of interpretations of the archaeological record. Alison Wylie adopts a critical theory approach focused on revealing how power relations and implicit biases have shaped archaeology as a discipline. While Bender and Wylie both aim to challenge the prevailing processual approach in archaeology, their methods and foci differ in key ways.   

Bender argues that we cannot interpret the archaeological record in a strictly objective, scientific manner as advocated by processual archaeologists. She believes archaeology is a social practice that produces knowledge rather than simply discovers it. In her work at the Neolithic monument of Avebury, Bender employed interpretive and reflexive methods, consulting not just archaeological evidence but also local legends, folklore, and modern beliefs about the site. Her goal was to illuminate the many meanings that have been constructed around Avebury across time. This pluralistic approach reflects Bender’s view that there are many possible interpretations of the past, not a single objective truth waiting to be uncovered.

In contrast, Wylie aims to interrogate the social and political factors that have shaped archaeology itself. She adopts critical theory concepts like the “politics of evidence” to argue that archaeological facts do not exist independently from the theoretical perspectives and biases of archaeologists. Wylie examines how gender stereotypes and androcentric assumptions have influenced interpretations of prehistoric European societies as male-dominated. She also shows how imperialist and nationalist interests shaped archaeology, citing the Kennewick Man controversy as an example. Wylie believes critical self-examination is necessary to overcome systemic prejudices and produce ethical archaeology.   

While Bender and Wylie share a post-processual interest in reflexivity and subjectivity, their approaches differ in scope and intent. Bender focuses on pluralizing interpretations of archaeological sites and artifacts. Wylie investigates how wider social biases and power dynamics have shaped the construction of archaeological knowledge. Bender opens up space for new meanings of the past whereas Wylie aims to critique existing meanings that reflect problematic assumptions. However, both scholars argue convincingly that objective, value-free archaeology is impossible. By revealing how knowledge is produced rather than discovered, Bender and Wylie provide philosophical justification for an interpretive, reflexive archaeology that sees pluralism and ethics as intertwined. Overall, the post-processual and critical theory perspectives have brought profound and enduring changes to archaeology as a discipline.
