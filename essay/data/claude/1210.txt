The Kegworth disaster refers to the accident involving British Midland Flight 92 on January 8, 1989. The Douglas DC-10 aircraft crashed onto the embankment of the M1 motorway near Kegworth, Leicestershire, England, while attempting to conduct an emergency landing at East Midlands Airport. Of the 47 people on board, 39 passengers and 2 crew members survived. The crash was caused by a fan blade fracture in the port engine after a bird strike, which caused severe vibration that fooled the pilots into believe the starboard engine had failed, leading them to shut down the starboard engine instead of the faulty port engine. Several factors contributed to this disaster and misdiagnosis by the cockpit crew, which potentially could have been avoided.  

Firstly, the cockpit crew lacked understanding and experience in handling engine malfunctions and failures in the DC-10. The captain had only recently been promoted and had limited experience flying the DC-10, while the first officer and flight engineer were both on their first flight in their new roles. They were not fully familiar with all the indicators, alerts and procedures to accurately diagnose an engine problem. With more extensive training and experience, the cockpit crew could have potentially identified the correct malfunctioning engine and taken appropriate action to shut it down, avoiding the crash.

Secondly, the design of the DC-10 made it difficult to accurately identify which engine had failed or was malfunctioning. The alerts and indications for the two engines were not clearly separated on the cockpit displays. When the port engine began vibrating violently due to the fan blade fracture, the crew received multiple alerts that did not specify which engine had the problem. The pathways for fuel lines, control cables and pipes were also located in close proximity for the two engines, so damage to one could potentially affect the other, further confusing the diagnosis. With a better designed alert system that clearly indicated the source of the alerts and separated the infrastructure for the port and starboard engines, the crew may have pinpointed the correct engine to shut down.

Thirdly, British Midland airline's engine failure checklist and crew training did not provide sufficiently detailed steps and guidance for identifying an engine malfunction and determining appropriate action. The checklist did not identify the key symptoms and characteristics of different types of engine failures to distinguish one from another. The crew training also focused more on emergency landings and evacuation rather than diagnosis and in-air troubleshooting of the aircraft itself. With a more rigorous checklist and status drill that simulated various single engine malfunction scenarios, the cockpit crew could have developed the proficiency to correctly handle the situation.  

In conclusion, the Kegworth disaster was the result of a combination of factors, including lack of experience and training of the cockpit crew in engine failure diagnosis, issues with the alert and monitoring systems that made it difficult to identify the malfunctioning engine, and inadequacies with the engine failure checklist and procedures. This tragic accident highlights the importance of comprehensive crew training, aircraft systems designs that minimize confusion in complex emergency situations, and decision support tools that provide clear and structured guidance for all stages of a flight, including diagnosis and recovery from technical issues. With a series of relatively minor but critical improvements in these areas, the Kegworth disaster could likely have been avoided, saving lives and the integrity of the aircraft.
