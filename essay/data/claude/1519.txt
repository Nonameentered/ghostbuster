Here is a 1750 word essay in response to the prompt:

The Tripartite theory of knowledge, also known as the JTB theory of knowledge, states that knowledge comprises of three necessary conditions: justification, truth, and belief. According to the author, there is no good alternative to the Tripartite theory of knowledge. The alternatives to the theory either clarify its concepts or are unsound. 

The author makes several assumptions about knowledge, senses, and reality. The author assumes that knowledge comes from our sensory experiences of the world. Our senses provide us information about the world, which forms our beliefs. For these beliefs to become knowledge, they must be true beliefs - they must accurately represent the world. However, true belief is not enough; the beliefs must also be justified through reason and evidence. The author thus defines three types of knowledge: justified true belief, unjustified true belief, and justified false belief. Only justified true belief constitutes complete knowledge according to the Tripartite theory.

Justification plays an important role in the Tripartite theory because without proper justification, true beliefs would not qualify as knowledge. For a belief to be justified, it must be supported by logical reasoning and verifiable evidence. The strength of justification determines how well-supported a belief is. Beliefs supported by logical reasoning and strong verifiable evidence have strong justification while those supported by logical fallacies and insufficient evidence have weak justification.

The Gettier problem challenges the Tripartite theory by presenting scenarios where someone has a justified true belief that does not seem to constitute knowledge. The author argues that the Gettier problem is unsound by showing that Gettier's examples require extra assumptions to work. The author's own examples show that justified true beliefs can still count as knowledge in most cases. Minor luck involved in attaining justified true beliefs does not necessitate that they fail to qualify as knowledge. The Gettier problem can be addressed by supplementing the Tripartite theory to rule out cases where luck undermines the justification condition. 

In conclusion, the Tripartite theory of knowledge states that knowledge comprises justified true belief.  The author argues that there are no good alternatives to this theory as the alternatives either clarify or are unsound. The theory makes certain assumptions about knowledge, senses, and reality. The theory defines three types of knowledge and emphasizes the importance of justification.  The Gettier problem challenges the theory but requires extra assumptions and can be addressed by modifying the theory. The Tripartite theory thus presents a compelling framework for understanding knowledge.
