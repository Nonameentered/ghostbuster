Over the latter half of the twentieth century, there were several major developments in international criminal law aimed at ending impunity for grave breaches of international humanitarian and human rights law. These developments have attempted to curb the impunity traditionally enjoyed by government leaders under the doctrine of state sovereignty. However, their effectiveness remains limited by the extent to which states are willing to forfeit some sovereignty and submit to international jurisdiction.

The first major development was the establishment of the International Military Tribunals at Nuremberg and Tokyo following World War II. These tribunals prosecuted political and military leaders of the Axis powers for war crimes, crimes against peace, and crimes against humanity. They demonstrated that government officials could be held individually criminally liable for violations of international law. However, their jurisdiction was limited to crimes committed during WWII in Europe and Asia. They did not establish a permanent international criminal court.  

The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights articulated universal human rights and fundamental freedoms, but as a declaration it was not legally binding. It did, however, lay the groundwork for subsequent human rights treaties like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These treaties obligate states to respect certain civil and political rights, but they offer only limited mechanisms to prosecute individuals for violations. States must consent to external scrutiny of their human rights records.

The 1948 Genocide Convention was the first human rights treaty adopted by the UN General Assembly. It defined the crime of genocide and obliged states to prevent and punish it. However, it did not establish its own court or tribunal, instead requiring states to prosecute genocidal acts through their domestic legal systems. Its enforcement remains limited by the political will of states.

A significant breakthrough came with the 1993 establishment of the ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), followed by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). These tribunals had jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. They demonstrated that heads of state and government officials could be prosecuted for atrocities committed against their own populations. However, their jurisdiction was limited to specific conflicts, and they were created by resolutions of the UN Security Council, requiring political will within the Council.

In 1998, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) established the first permanent international criminal court. The ICC has jurisdiction over the gravest international crimes, including genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and the crime of aggression. However, the ICC depends entirely on states parties to the Rome Statute to cooperate with its investigations and implement its arrest warrants. Powerful states like the US, Russia and China remain outside the ICC.  

In conclusion, while international criminal law has made substantial progress toward ending impunity since the post-WWII tribunals, its enforcement continues to face political obstacles and depends heavily on the cooperation of states. Government leaders still enjoy a degree of impunity, especially when supported by powerful allies or able to shield themselves under the banner of state sovereignty. International courts have limited jurisdiction and resources. Nevertheless, a normative framework now exists in international law declaring that systematic human rights abuses are not solely internal state matters. International criminal justice remains an unfinished but vital project. Overall, there has been progress, but still a long road ahead to ending impunity.
