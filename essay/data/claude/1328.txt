The intentional practices of cranial deformation and modification have long been a cultural tradition observed throughout wide parts of the ancient world. From Europe to the Middle East to the Americas, various forms of cranial modification were employed for cosmological, ideological and aesthetic reasons. This practice involved binding and deforming the soft cranial bones of infants to produce an elongated or altered skull shape as the child grew. While these practices are no longer common today, they present an interesting area of study for both archaeologists and physical anthropologists. However, their analysis is complicated by the fact that some pathological conditions can also produce irregular skulls shapes that may resemble the results of intentional modification. It is thus important to differentiate between cultural modification and natural, pathological deformities.

There are two primary forms of intentional cranial modification: annular modifications, produced by a ring-shaped apparatus, resulting in skull elongation, and tabular modifications, produced by boards or plates, resulting in flattening of parts of the skull. The specific shape is dictated by the composition, construction, and application of the deforming apparatus, as well as the age at which modification begins and the length of time it is applied. Cultural factors also play a role, as some shapes may be preferred over others due to perceived attractiveness or denoting a particular social status. For example, an elongated skull was a mark of high social status in the royal court of the ancient Maya.  

Annular modifications are produced by wrapping bandages around the circumference of the skull, applying constant pressure over time. The earlier and more tightly this is applied, the more pronounced the resulting elongation will be. The final shape depends on whether pressure is applied predominantly in a transverse, antero-posterior, or oblique direction. Binding applied transversely across the maximum width of the skull will produce a long, narrow skull with narrow temporal regions. Pressure applied antero-posteriorly, from front to back, results in an elongated skull shape with a sloping forehead and occiput. Oblique pressure can produce asymmetry and a parallelogram-like skull shape. Examples of annular elongation have been observed in ancient Egypt, where the practice dates back to the Predynastic period, and South America among some indigenous Andean populations.   

Tabular modifications, on the other hand, involve the use of rigid plates or boards in close contact with the growing skull to produce a flatter shape in the areas of contact. They are more likely to result in asymmetries and irregular surface contours compared to annular modifications. The specific points of contact on the skull determine the final modified form. For example, the practice of occipital flattening, with pressure applied to the occipital bone at the back of the skull, was common among some Native American tribes, especially in infancy. Frontal flattening was observed in ancient Mesopotamia. Temporal modifications, with pressure on the temporal bones, were seen in Timor islanders of the Pacific. The age of the individual, duration and degree of pressure all factor into the severity of flatness produced.  

While these practices were culturally prescribed and accepted, they still caused physical harm, so the health effects on ancient populations are debated. Some studies show no significant impact, while others suggest potential impacts on vision, chewing, and cognitive abilities. Determining the precise health effects, however, is complicated by the lack of large-scale bioarchaeological studies on samples of modified crania. Additional research is still needed.  

The major challenge in studying artificially deformed crania is distinguishing them from naturally abnormal skulls resulting from pathology or abnormal growth. Several pathological conditions, known as craniosynostoses, can produce irregular skull shapes, including: scaphocephaly (elongated, narrow skull), plagiocephaly (asymmetric flattening), and brachycephaly (anteroposterior shortening). Clinical analysis of surface contours and deformities, as well as radiological examination, are required to determine the origins of atypical skull shapes and differentiate between cultural and pathological phenomena.  Some key factors that aid in diagnosis are: 

1) Bilateral vs. unilateral features. Pathological deformities often impact only one side of the skull, producing asymmetry, while intentional modifications are usually bilaterally symmetrical. 

2) Sharp vs. rounded contours. The edges and contours of culturally modified skulls tend to be smoother and more rounded, without jagged or sharp deformities common in craniosynostoses and growth abnormalities. 

3) Porosity and bone thickness. Modified skulls exhibit normal bone thickness and porosity for the individual's age, while pathological conditions often result in irregular thickening or porosity of the bone.

4) Time period and cultural context. Knowledge about the practices common to particular ancient cultures and time periods informs interpretations of skull deformities. Changes over time can also indicate evolving cultural preferences or influences from other groups.  

In summary, the practice of intentional cranial modification and deformation was widespread in many ancient cultures and took diverse forms based on the apparatus employed, duration of application, and desired final shape. Culturally modified skulls require careful analysis to differentiate them from pathologically deformed crania, which can share some superficial similarities. A combination of anatomical, radiological, cultural and temporal factors must be considered when making a differential diagnosis between intentional modification and pathological conditions in archaeological crania. The ability to identify and understand culturally modified skulls provides insight into the beliefs, values and practices of past populations, allowing for a more nuanced reconstruction of their cultural identities and interactions.
