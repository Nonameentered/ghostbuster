Here is a 743 word essay on how firms try to solve the principal-agent problem:

The principal-agent problem arises when one party (the principal) delegates work to another party (the agent) but has limited ability to monitor the agent's actions and ensure they are acting in the principal's best interest. This problem is prevalent in modern corporations, where shareholders (principals) hire managers (agents) to run the company on their behalf. However, managers may pursue their own self-interest rather than maximize shareholder value. 

There are several mechanisms firms use to help align the interests of managers and shareholders. One is through organizational design. Firms can be structured in ways  that make it easier to monitor managers, such as by reducing the management hierarchy so top executives are more directly overseeing business units. Firms may also separate the roles of CEO and Chairman of the Board to improve board oversight of the CEO. Regular reporting requirements and performance evaluations provide more transparency into managers' work. 

Another mechanism is through incentives, especially executive compensation. Tying pay to performance through bonuses, stock options, and equity compensation gives managers a financial incentive to grow the stock price and meet key performance metrics. However, there is an ongoing debate about the optimal structure of executive pay, as some argue it has led to excessive risk taking and short term thinking. Restricted stock grants that vest over time are one approach that may encourage more long-term thinking.

A third mechanism is the market for corporate control, also known as the threat of takeovers. If managers are underperforming and not maximizing shareholder value, another firm may acquire the company, replacing the existing managers. The prospect of losing their jobs encourages managers to focus on actions that will boost the stock price and make the company less vulnerable to takeovers. However, in practice the market for corporate control is imperfect, and there are tactics like poison pills that managers can use to entrench themselves even when not acting in shareholders' interests.

In summary, firms employ several interrelated mechanisms to address the principal-agent problem. Organizational design, incentives, and governance practices aim to give managers discretion within constraints, align their interests with shareholder interests, and hold them accountable for their performance. When these mechanisms function properly, they serve to minimize agency costs and shape managerial behavior in ways that benefit the firm's owners and stability. Overall, solving the principal-agent problem remains an ongoing balancing act in corporate management and oversight.
