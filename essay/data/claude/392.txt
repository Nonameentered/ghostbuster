Being literate has traditionally referred to the ability to read and write, but in today's world the concept of literacy encompasses much more. To be fully literate in the 21st century requires a wide range of skills that go beyond the strictly textual to include visual, digital, and performative literacies. One key aspect of an expanded conception of literacy is the idea of "dramatic literacy," the ability to understand and thoughtfully engage with creative works of theater and drama.  

Achieving a high level of dramatic literacy is challenging and requires exposure to drama in many forms. Simply reading plays is not enough; one must see them performed live or through recordings to get a full sense of their impact. Listen to or watch interviews with actors, directors, and playwrights discussing their creative processes. Analyze what goes into translating words on a page into a full production. Consider how sets, costumes, lighting, music, and the delivery and blocking of lines all contribute to the overall effect. Reflect on how the themes and ideas in the play are conveyed through performance. 

Drama education is key to developing dramatic literacy, but approaches to teaching drama vary. On one end of the spectrum are "elitist" approaches focused on canonical Western plays and theater traditions. These approaches risk narrowing students' perspectives unless supplemented with a diverse range of dramatic works from other cultures and time periods. On the other end are highly "democratic" approaches where students create their own plays and learn through improvisation alone. These approaches may lack grounding in foundational dramatic techniques and knowledge of important plays.

The best approach lies somewhere in the middle, balancing tradition and innovation. Students should study influential plays from major Western playwrights like Shakespeare, Ibsen, and Beckett to understand their historical and cultural significance. But they should also engage with contemporary works and non-Western forms of drama like Noh theater, Sanskrit drama, and Yoruba opera. Students need guidance in foundational skills like character development, dialogue, and story structure. But they should also have opportunities to improvise and create their own original works.

Overall, achieving a high level of dramatic literacy requires determination and an open, inquiring mindset. One must seek out a diverse range of plays in production, not just on the page. Analyze not just the words, but how all the elements of performance come together to create meaning. Try taking on different roles through improvisation. Create your own dramatic works to deepen your understanding of what goes into them. Discussion and debate with others also helps in exploring new perspectives on drama. 

With a balance of theory and practice and an expanded conception of "literature" that embraces live performance, people today can achieve a level of dramatic literacy that allows them to be not just consumers but conscious, thoughtful participants in the ongoing artistic dialogue between playwrights, actors, directors, and audiences. Dramatic literacy enriches one's relationship with the theater and allows for a deeper understanding of humanity through the stories we tell on the stage. Overall, it signifies an important aspect of what it means to be a fully literate, culturally-engaged person in the modern world.
