The widespread fascination with Chinese luxury goods in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe had a profound effect on European taste, social practices, and commerce. Porcelain, silk textiles, lacquerware, and other goods from China were highly prized by European elites and came to symbolize refined taste and high status. The importation and circulation of these goods within Europe also spurred new forms of sociability centered around collecting and displaying them. At the same time, the European market and European perceptions of Chinese artistry greatly transformed these luxury goods and the ways they were valued. 

Chinese porcelain, in particular, captivated European consumers with its delicate beauty. Porcelain tableware and decorative objects were valued as symbols of taste and status, and collecting them became a mark of cultivation. As porcelain found its way into the homes of nobility and the emerging bourgeoisie alike, it introduced new styles of dining and decorating centered around displaying oneâ€™s porcelain pieces. The popularity of porcelain also drove its mass production in China to meet European demand, resulting in a wider range of price points that made it accessible to a broader range of social classes.

The silk textiles, paintings, lacquerware, and other goods imported from China were also highly sought after in Europe. These goods were prominently featured in European paintings and portraiture, demonstrating the prestige they conveyed. Private collectors amassed large collections of Chinese luxury goods, and new social activities emerged around viewing and appreciating these collections. At the same time, European perceptions of Chinese goods as exotic and whimsical resulted in their motifs and styles being appropriated and reinvented for European tastes. Chinese artistic influences made their way into European art, fashion, and interior design.

The importation of Chinese luxury goods was enabled by the growth of European trading companies and the expansion of sea trade in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Companies like the English and Dutch East India Companies brought shiploads of porcelain, silk, lacquerware, and other goods back to Europe, where they were sold in shops and auction houses. This new availability of Chinese goods gave rise to intermediary occupations like shopkeepers, auctioneers, and antique dealers. The wide circulation and resale of Chinese luxury goods also resulted in competitive markets that drove their prices down over time, allowing for more widespread consumption.

In conclusion, Chinese luxury goods were deeply embedded in European material culture, society, trade, and economics during this period. While attracting European consumers with their beauty, novelty, and status, these goods were also highly commercialized and reinvented to suit European tastes. They gave rise to new social practices of collecting and displaying but were also transformed by the European market. The fascination with Chinese luxury goods shaped European taste and commerce in a profoundly reciprocal way.
