After World War II, the United States experienced a period of unprecedented economic prosperity and growth of the middle class. Several factors contributed to the rise of the affluent society and expansion of the middle class in postwar America. 

Economically, America benefited from its position as the dominant industrial power after the war. With most of Europe and Asia in ruins, the U.S. economy surged as American factories produced goods for both domestic consumption and export. New technologies like television, air conditioning, and automobiles fueled consumer demand. At the same time, the postwar baby boom led to a massive increase in population and a new generation of young consumers.

The government also intervened in ways that directly fostered the growth of the middle class. The Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, known as the GI Bill, provided educational opportunities and home loan guarantees for millions of returning World War II veterans. The GI Bill allowed veterans to attend college and vocational schools, which increased their skills and earning potential. It also made home ownership affordable for many veterans by providing low-interest loans and down payment assistance. Between 1944 and 1952, the VA backed nearly 2.5 million home loans for veterans.

The rise of prefabricated housing and suburban development also shaped the postwar American dream of home ownership and middle-class living. Developers constructed affordable tract housing on suburban lots surrounding major cities. The homes were modest but featured modern designs and appliances that conveyed a sense of futuristic living. The new suburban neighborhoods were filled by young professionals and veterans taking advantage of the GI Bill to buy their first homes, often with the aid of Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured mortgages. 

The postwar economic expansion, government programs, consumer technologies, and suburbanization of the 1950s all combined to support the growth of the middle class and realize the vision of an affluent society that was at once modern and prosperous. For the generation that came of age after the war, the American dream was defined as a suburban home, modern conveniences, access to higher education, and an upwardly mobile career path -- all enabled by the nation's booming economy and expanded social programs.

In conclusion, the widespread postwar prosperity in America was the result of several economic, social, and policy factors working together. Robust economic growth provided opportunities for stable jobs and higher wages. Government spending through programs like the GI Bill and FHA made home ownership and higher education accessible to millions of Americans. And new industries satisfied consumers' demand for the latest products, appliances, and experiences that defined postwar living standards. All of these forces combined to promote the rise of the affluent society and shape the middle-class aspirations of postwar Americans.
