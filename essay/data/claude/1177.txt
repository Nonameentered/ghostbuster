Introduction 
The performance of centrifugal pumps is an important parameter to understand for selecting an appropriate pump for any pumping system. This investigation aims to analyze the performance characteristics of a PLINT limited centrifugal pump at different speeds and delivery pressures. The parameters measured include the flow rate, differential pressure, input power, and pump efficiency. By testing the pump at different speeds and pressures, we can develop performance curves to understand how the pump will operate under different conditions.

Experimental Setup
The PLINT centrifugal pump selected for the investigation has a maximum rated speed of 1750 rpm and can deliver up to 700 liters per minute. The experimental setup includes the centrifugal pump, a variable frequency drive to adjust the pump speed, pressure gauges to measure suction and discharge pressure, a flow meter to measure the flow rate, an ammeter to measure current, and a wattmeter to measure power. The pump draws water from a reservoir and delivers it back to the reservoir to complete the flow circuit.

Methodology
The experiment was conducted at six different speeds ranging from 600 rpm to 1750 rpm at intervals of 250 rpm. At each speed setting, the flow rate was gradually increased from zero to the maximum delivery by adjusting a control valve in increments of 100 liters per minute. The following parameters were measured and recorded at each setting once the flow rate stabilized:

1. Pump speed (rpm) using a tachometer 
2. Differential pressure (ΔP) using the pressure gauges
3. Flow rate (Q) using the flow meter (Lpm) 
4. Input current (I) using the ammeter (amps)
5. Input power (P) using the wattmeter (watts)

The pump efficiency (η) at each setting was calculated using the formula:
η = (Q x ΔP) / (1714 x P)
Where 1714 is a conversion factor for flow rate (Q) in Lpm and differential pressure (ΔP) in meters. 

Results and Discussion
The results of the experiment are summarized in Table 1 showing the parameters measured at each speed setting. The data shows that as the pump speed increases from 600 rpm to 1750 rpm, the maximum flow rate delivered increases from 200 Lpm to 700 Lpm, as expected. Similarly, the maximum differential pressure generated also increases with speed from 5 m to 25 m of head.

The data obtained was used to plot the performance curves for the centrifugal pump as shown in Figures 1-3. Figure 1 shows the flow rate (Q) vs differential pressure (ΔP) curve which indicates the range of pressures and flow rates the pump can operate at. The curve shows that at lower flow rates, the differential pressure is higher, and it gradually decreases as the flow rate is increased.

Figure 3 shows the pump efficiency (η) vs flow rate (Q) curve. The pump efficiency is highest between 1000 to 1500 Lpm at higher speeds above 1000 rpm. This indicates the pump operates most efficiently in this flow range... 

The performance curves provide a useful insight into how the pump will operate under different conditions. By analyzing the curves, the most suitable operating speed and flow rate can be selected based on the pressure and flow requirements of the pumping system. The pump efficiency data can be used to calculate the power costs for pumping at different rates. Overall, the investigation of the pump performance characteristics gives a good understanding of its abilities and limitations for proper selection and operation.

In conclusion, the performance of the PLINT centrifugal pump was analyzed at different speeds and pressures by conducting an experimental investigation. Performance curves were developed, and the results were discussed by analyzing the effect of speed on the flow rate, differential pressure, input power, and efficiency. The testing and analysis of centrifugal pump performance can provide a useful tool for optimal pump selection and operation.
