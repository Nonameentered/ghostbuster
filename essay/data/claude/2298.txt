Here is a draft 505 word essay in response to the prompt:

There are several factors that could lead to higher tomato production in two farmers employing different cultivation methods. The key factors are use of improved seed varieties, favourable environmental conditions, soil health and nutrients, pest and disease control, and effective management practices. 

An important factor is the use of high-yielding and disease-resistant seed varieties. Newer hybrids and grafted seedlings have been bred specifically for enhanced productivity and resilience. Farmer A may be using an older open-pollinated variety, while Farmer B has invested in newer hybrid seeds with greater growth potential and sturdiness, enabling higher yields.

Environmental conditions, especially sunlight, temperature, and rainfall, strongly impact tomato growth and fruiting. Farmer B's location may receive more sunlight hours and warmer temperatures during the growing season compared to Farmer A, accelerating growth and ripening. Additionally, optimal and evenly distributed rainfall will support healthy plant growth, while lack of rain can stress plants and reduce yields. Farmer B may benefit from a more favourable climate relative to Farmer A.

Soil quality plays a vital role in plant health and crop productivity. Soil with balanced nutrients (especially nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), neutral pH, high organic matter, and good drainage will support maximum tomato yields. Farmer B may have invested in soil testing and amendment to optimize soil conditions for tomatoes, while Farmer A's soil may lack in certain nutrients or be too acidic or alkaline to maximize productivity.

Effective pest and disease management is critical to avoid damage to plants and fruits. Farmer B may implement an integrated pest management plan, using mulches, crop rotation, and natural predators in addition to limited and targeted spraying of organic pesticides. Farmer A, on the other hand, may not control pests and diseases adequately, leading to greater losses.  

Finally, farm management practices like staking, trellising, and pruning can significantly impact tomato yields. Staking and trellising tomatoes supports their heavy fruiting branches and provides greater air circulation, which enhances growth and health. Pruning the plants channels the plants' energy into the developing fruits. Farmer B likely employs staking and pruning, while Farmer A may let plants sprawl on the ground, contributing to yield differences.

In summary, the most economically effective treatment to maximize tomato yield is to improve management practices, including using disease-resistant high-yielding seed varieties, providing an optimal growth environment, enriching and balancing soil nutrients, implementing integrated pest management, and staking and pruning plants to support maximum fruiting. Making investments in all these areas can substantially improve tomato productivity and profitability.
