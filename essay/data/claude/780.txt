Here is a 498-word essay in response to the prompt:

A cantilever system consists of a rigid beam structure anchored and supported at one end with a weight suspended at the free end. The beam exhibits elastic deformation under the influence of the weight, and this deformation can be measured to determine the magnitude of the force acting on the end of the cantilever. Strain gauges and beam-type load cells are commonly used to measure this deformation and determine the applied force with a high degree of sensitivity and accuracy.

As the cantilever beam bends, the outer surface is in tension and inner surface in compression. Strain gauges positioned on the outer surface will undergo elongation, while those on the inner surface will shorten. By combining gauges in a Wheatstone bridge arrangement, this can generate a small voltage output proportional to the degree of deformation. However, this output is usually very small and requires amplification using specialized amplifiers with high input impedance. The amplified signal can then be displayed on analogue or digital meters to provide a real-time readout of the applied force.

Alternatively, beam-type load cells can be used by positioning strain gauges on a purpose-built cell that sits between the cantilever beam and the weight. As the beam deforms under load, the cell also deforms, and the gauges provide the same voltage output for amplification and display. Beam-type load cells have the advantage of higher sensitivity since the cell can be optimized for the expected load ranges. They also isolate the gauges from the effects of beam material and focus the measurement on the applied weight.  

The dimensions and material properties of the cantilever beam have a significant influence on system sensitivity. A longer beam length will result in higher flexibility and greater deformation under the same load. The cross-sectional area and the module of elasticity of the beam material also determine its flexibility and the degree of sag it exhibits. A more flexible beam allows for the use of lower capacity load cells and amplifiers, enhancing sensitivity. Care must be taken, however, to avoid overloading the beam to the point of permanent deformation.

In summary, cantilever-based weighing systems apply minimal force to the end of a beam and measure resulting elastic deformation to determine the applied load. Strain gauges and load cells convert this deformation into electronic signals that can be amplified, displayed and recorded. Suitable design of the cantilever dimensions and selection of instrumentation help optimize the sensitivity and accuracy of such systems.
