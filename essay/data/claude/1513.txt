The application of Information Communication Technology (ICT) into the tourism industry has significantly transformed the distribution channels and structure of the industry. Traditionally, tourism organizations rely heavily on Computerized Reservation Systems (CRS) and Global Distribution Systems (GDS) to distribute their products and services to travel agents and consumers. However, with the rapid development of the Internet, online distribution channels are steadily replacing the role of traditional distribution channels and redefining the industry structure. 

From an organizational perspective, CRS and GDS provide an efficient way for tourism organizations such as airlines, hotels, and tour operators to distribute inventory to a large network of travel agents. Travel agents then provide consultation and booking services to consumers. This traditional distribution channel is highly centralized with the dominance of a few mega-GDSs, including Amadeus, Sabre, and Galileo. Although efficient, this channel can be costly to both organizations and consumers due to the additional surcharges from the dependency on travel agents.

The rise of the Internet has given birth to various online distribution channels that threaten the existence of traditional channels. Tourism organizations can now distribute and sell their products on their own website or via online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Expedia and Booking.com. These online channels significantly reduce distribution cost and allow organizations to directly reach much larger numbers of tech-savvy consumers. However, the decentralized nature of the Internet also means loss of control over how products and prices are presented to consumers. This can potentially lead to intense price competition and revenue loss.

From a consumer perspective, the Internet provides a convenient one-stop platform to search for and book the best travel deals. Travelers now rely less on travel agents and are more inclined to book travel online. In particular, OTAs are popular for their huge selections, price comparisons, and bundled deals. However, concerns over lack of personal services and protection are also common drawbacks of online booking. Between the three internet distribution channels, including organization website, OTAs, and price comparison websites, I would recommend organizations to focus on distributing through their own website and OTAs. Organization website allows direct access to customers and control over brand presentation while OTAs provide an additional sales channel to reach wider market segments. Price comparison websites, on the other hand, tend to provoke price wars and reduce brand loyalty.

In conclusion, ICT has revolutionized the distribution system in the tourism industry. The rise of online distribution channels, especially the OTAs, is transforming the traditional channel dominated by CRS and GDS. Tourism organizations need to tap into the Internet to gain direct access to customers. A balanced distribution mix that includes organization website, OTAs, as well as traditional travel agents, should be adopted to maximize reach and revenue. At the same time, organizations must be cautious with the loss of control over distribution and brand representation on the Internet. Price competitiveness and brand consistency should be the major concerns. Overall, ICT is redefining tourism distribution and any tourism organizations that fail to adapt to this trend will risk being left behind.
