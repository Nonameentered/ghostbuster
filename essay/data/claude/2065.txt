The European Union's decision to eliminate export subsidies for dairy products by 2020 will have a significant impact on its dairy policy and farming sector. Export subsidies, also known as export refunds, were a mechanism used by the EU to support its dairy producers and exports. They made EU dairy exports artificially cheap on global markets by subsidizing the difference between EU internal prices and world market prices. This allowed EU dairy products to compete on global markets and supported EU dairy exports. 

However, export subsidies have long been a contentious issue in international trade. They distort free market dynamics by giving producers an unfair competitive advantage. The World Trade Organization  has pushed for disciplines on agricultural export subsidies, including in the Uruguay Round agreement in 1994 which committed members to reduce export subsidies. The 2015 WTO agreement in Nairobi built on these commitments by aiming to eliminate agricultural export subsidies by 2020.

The EU's decision to eliminate dairy export subsidies is a direct result of these WTO negotiations and commitments. Facing pressures from trading partners and a desire to achieve a successful conclusion of the Doha Round of WTO talks, the EU agreed to phase out export subsidies for dairy over time. This will have major consequences for the EU's Common Agricultural Policy regime for dairy and its extensive system of price controls and subsidies for dairy producers. 

Without export subsidies, EU dairy exports will have to compete on a more level playing field on global markets based solely on price and quality. Many observers expect the EU to lose considerable export market share as a result. EU dairy producers and processors will also receive lower prices for their products. This could threaten the viability of some producers.

In response, the EU will have to adjust its dairy policy to provide alternative support measures for its dairy sector. It may increase direct payments to dairy farmers to make up for their loss of income from lower prices. It could also invest in programs to increase productivity and competitiveness, including incentives for value-added products with stronger brand recognition. The EU may also restrict dairy production to balance supply and demand, as well as restructure the dairy processing sector.

In summary, the elimination of export subsidies will reduce the EU's competitive advantage on global dairy export markets, lower income for dairy producers, and force a significant reform of EU dairy policy. The EU will have to provide alternative support for its dairy sector while also boosting competitiveness. The influence of WTO rules and negotiations has clearly catalyzed a transformation of the EU's approach to its dairy sector. With the elimination of export subsidies, EU dairy policy is entering a new era focused on competitiveness over subsidies.
