There are several factors that influence a household's decision to own or rent their home and the associated costs of each housing tenure choice. The factors that determine housing tenure choice and costs include income and wealth, housing market conditions, financial constraints, lifestyle preferences, mobility needs, and government policies.  These factors often influence the premium or discount of buying versus renting a home and the relative costs associated with each tenure type.

Income and wealth are two of the most significant factors that determine if a household can own or rent their home and the relative costs. Owning a home typically requires an upfront down payment and the ability to qualify for a mortgage, which depends on a household's income, debt levels, and credit score. Households with higher income and wealth are more likely to afford the costs of homeownership and qualify for a mortgage. In contrast, renting has lower upfront costs but often higher ongoing housing costs relative to income. Households with lower income and wealth may face challenges affording a downpayment or qualifying for a mortgage and thus turn to the rental market, often facing a higher proportion of their income going to housing costs.

Housing market conditions also strongly influence the costs of owning versus renting and a household's tenure choice. When house prices are high relative to incomes, the costs of homeownership rise, and renting becomes more attractive. However, in markets where house prices are stable or declining, owning becomes more affordable and provides an opportunity for price appreciation, influencing more households to buy. Interest rates also determine the cost of ownership through the cost of a mortgage. Higher interest rates increase mortgage payments, impacting affordability and tenure choice. Rental market conditions, like low rental vacancy rates and high demand, lead to higher rents, reducing the discount of renting relative to owning.

A household's financial situation and access to credit also affects their ability to afford the upfront costs of ownership and the mortgage payments. Households with significant debt, low savings, poor credit, or unstable income may face challenges qualifying for a mortgage and affording the responsibilities of homeownership. They often have to turn to the rental market despite potentially higher long-term costs. Government policies around housing finance, taxation, zoning, and subsidies also create incentives around tenure choice. For example, the mortgage interest tax deduction lowers the after-tax cost of a mortgage, incentivizing homeownership. Rent control or rent subsidies, on the other hand, lower the cost of renting, influencing more households to rent.

Finally, lifestyle factors like mobility needs or the desire to customize one's living space also drive tenure choice and costs. Households that value flexibility and mobility often prefer renting despite potential long-term financial disadvantages in some markets. Households wanting to customize their homes and build equity for the long-term typically prefer buying, willing to accept higher upfront and ongoing costs to achieve their housing goals.      

In summary, a range of factors including income, housing costs, financial constraints, lifestyle preferences, and government policies intertwine to influence a household's decision to own or rent their home and the relative costs of each option. These factors drive a complex set of trade-offs between the higher upfront costs of ownership versus the potential higher longer-term costs of renting, creating a broad variety of outcomes in the owning-renting premium that households experience. Overall, a household's ability to afford their desired housing tenure and the associated costs come down to their unique financial and life situation.
