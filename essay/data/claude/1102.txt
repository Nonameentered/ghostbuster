Here is a 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

X-ray diffraction is a powerful technique that can be used to gain insights into the structure of crystalline materials. By analyzing the pattern of x-ray beams that diffract off the crystal lattice, we can determine key parameters such as the lattice constants and ionic radii of the crystal. 

The principles of x-ray diffraction were established by William Lawrence Bragg and Max von Laue. Bragg proposed that x-rays of a specific wavelength diffract off a crystal at angles that satisfy Bragg's Law: nλ=2d sinθ, where n is an integer, λ is the wavelength of the x-ray, d is the spacing between crystal planes, and θ is the angle of incidence of the x-ray beam. By measuring the angles of the diffracted x-ray beams, the d-spacing between crystal planes can be calculated using Bragg's Law.

The Laue method involves passing a broad beam of white radiation through a crystal and recording the pattern of diffracted x-rays on a photographic film. The spots on the film correspond to different crystal planes in the lattice satisfying the Bragg condition for constructive interference of the x-rays. The geometry of these spots provides information about the symmetry and lattice constants of the crystal. A three-dimensional picture of the reciprocal lattice can be generated to calculate lattice constants with high precision. 

These principles were applied by Pauling and Brockway in 1933 to determine the lattice constants and ionic radii of five alkali halide crystals: LiF, NaCl, KCl, RbCl, and CsCl. They obtained powders of high purity and passed a collimated beam of white x-rays through each sample onto a photographic film. From the recorded Laue photographs, they measured the d-spacings between multiple crystal planes and indices (hkl) to calculate the lattice constants for each crystal using Bragg's Law. With the lattice constants known, the ionic radii could be determined based on the closest packing of ions in the lattice.

For example, in NaCl the d-spacing of the (200) plane was measured to be 1.23 Å from the Laue photograph. Using Bragg's Law, with λ=1.54 Å for Cu Kα radiation, this corresponds to a lattice constant of 5.64 Å for the face-centered cubic structure of NaCl. The radius of the Na+ ion was then calculated to be 102 pm to just touch the surrounding Cl- ions. Similar analyses were done for the other alkali halides, yielding the first precisely measured ionic radii.

There are some limitations and assumptions in this process that must be considered. The Laue method requires a powdered polycrystalline sample, so single crystal analysis is not possible. It also assumes that the sample is composed of an ideally symmetrical lattice, though lattice imperfections and distortions will introduce some error. The ionic radii are based on a theoretical closest packing of spheres, even though the ions have electron clouds that overlap in reality. However, by using high purity samples and multiple measurements, these effects can be minimized to determine remarkably accurate lattice constants, which provide fundamental insights into the crystal structures of materials.

In summary, x-ray diffraction and the principles of Bragg's Law and the Laue method can be used to calculate lattice constants and ionic radii of crystals. By analyzing the pattern of x-rays diffracted from a powdered crystal sample, the d-spacings between planes in the lattice can be determined and used to calculate the lattice constants with high precision. These constants, together with a closest packing model, provide a basis for calculating ionic radii, as demonstrated for alkali halide crystals. Despite some limitations, x-ray diffraction remains one of the most powerful tools for probing the atomic-scale geometry of crystals.
