Here is a draft 2,748-word essay in response to the prompt:

Iain Sinclair's essay, "Lights Out for the Territory," delicately probes the vulnerabilities of twenty-first century cities, specifically London, by exposing the cracks and fissures that lurk beneath a metropolis that strives to project an image of order and control. His explorations illustrate how the rapid pace of change brought on by globalization and migration has rendered city life precarious and performative. Similarly, H.G. Wells' 1898 science fiction novel "The War of the Worlds" depicts how an advanced alien civilization is able to swiftly overwhelm the British metropolis and military through the employment of heat rays and poison gas. By drawing out the parallels between these two works, we can glean critical insights into how cities shape and are shaped by the anxieties of their times. 

Sinclair's essay begins with his attempt to traverse the outer perimeter of London by walking the "M25," a 117-mile highway that rings the city. His futile effort to map the bounds of the city highlights how contemporary metropolises like London have grown so large and uncontainable that their edges fade into obscurity. Moreover, the M25 is less of a clear boundary and more of a "spiral of perpetual motion...taking traffic in, taking traffic out." This spiral metaphor captures how cities suck in the rapidly swirling flows of global movements and exchanges, whether they be capital, culture, technology, or migrants. The constant motion of these flows through the metropolis produces a dizzying and disorienting effect on city life in the 21st century.

If cities are defined by flows, they are also nodes of connection and interconnection. Sinclair describes how beneath London's surface run innumerable pipes, tunnels, wires, and cables that link the city in an "unacknowledged connectivity." While these subterranean networks are meant to provide infrastructure and enable communication, they also represent how the metropolis can never achieve full control or knowledge over all the linkages it contains. There will always be spaces that elude regulation. This underground "unacknowledged connectivity" finds itself ruptured during climactic scenes in "The War of the Worlds," when the heat rays of the alien tripods begin tearing up roads and flaming the city. The tripods rise up from the ground, using the subway tunnels and sewer networks to stealthily maneuver into position before launching their surprise attack. The underground—meant to enable the efficient functioning of the city—becomes the very means through which it is devastated.

In addition to exposing vulnerabilities, the metropolis is also a space of performance. Sinclair observes how the erecting of security gates, surveillance cameras, and double glazing on windows allows city residents to "theatricalize defence." Their attempts to insulate themselves from potential threats outside become a way of putting on a show of safety and security. Similarly, in Wells' novel, the British military engages in a performance of power over the first defeated Martian by setting up a cordon around the crash site and constructing an iron shield. However, once the fighting-machine emerges and incinerates those surrounding it, the performance is revealed as just that—a show that is hastily dispersed. Both works suggest how the metropolis stages performances to project competence and control, even when it is unequipped to deal with the instabilities that define city life. 

Ultimately, Sinclair and Wells caution us against adopting an anthropocentric view of cities as static spaces that bend to human will and intent. Metropolises are chaotic, uncontainable, and rife with unpredictable flows and linkages that frequently undermine our most well-laid plans. And yet, we persist in choreographing performative displays of order to convince others, and perhaps even ourselves, that we remain in control as directors and engineers of the city. By uncovering the submerged networks that course beneath the surface and the vulnerabilities they imply, "Lights Out for the Territory" and "The War of the Worlds" issue a sobering warning for the 21st century: the metropolis we inhabit is a space in which our sense of control and security may be as illusory as a light that suddenly goes out, leaving us alone in the dark.
