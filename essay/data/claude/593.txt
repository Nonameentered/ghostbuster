Trade unions in the United Kingdom have faced a steady decline in membership and influence since 1979. Several factors have contributed to the weakened state of trade unionism today. Legislatively, a series of anti-union laws passed under Conservative governments significantly constrained the power and influence of trade unions. The Industrial Relations Act of 1971 first imposed tighter regulation on trade union activities like striking. The Employment Acts of 1980 and 1982 made union membership optional, restricted closed shops, and introduced postal voting for union elections. The Trade Union Act of 1993 added further restrictions. These laws reduced the negotiating power of unions and made membership less appealing.  

Compositionally, the privatization, deregulation, and deindustrialization policies pursued since the 1980s have reduced the number of employees in industries traditionally well-represented by trade unions, such as manufacturing, mining, and transportation. With the decline of these sectors came the loss of millions of members from trade union rolls. Furthermore, the growth of employment in the service sector introduced new populations of workers largely unfamiliar with or unsympathetic towards trade unionism. The individualism promoted by Thatcherism and New Labour also fostered an anti-union sentiment among workers.  

At the organizational level, many analysts argue trade unions were too slow to respond to these social, political and economic changes. They failed to aggressively recruit new members or organize in growing sectors and companies. Unions also struggled with factionalism and a lack of cooperation during this period. Calls for unity and partnerships with employers and government have not generated substantial gains. The focus of unions seems to remain on traditional union roles like collective bargaining and strike action rather than new strategies such as organizing or social partnership.

Revitalization efforts offer some hope for trade unions, but successes have been modest. The increased cooperation of the former "Big Three" unions in the TUC is a positive step. Some unions have embraced organizing campaigns to recruit immigrant workers, young workers and service sector workers with limited gains. The promotion of "partnership" agreements with employers, as seen in industries like telecommunications, also show potential if expanded. However, austerity policies since 2010 have cut into public sector membership and anti-union sentiments remain.  

Overall, trade unions face substantial challenges in reversing their declining fortunes in Britain. While legislative constraints have eased slightly and new strategies offer potential for resurgence, significant obstacles around composition, sector and organization remain. A more radical break from traditional unionism towards social movement unionism and organizing may be necessary for large-scale gains. Unless and until trade unions can forge new alliances, recruit new members and embrace new partnership roles, their decline seems likely to continue. Strong, industry-wide federations and a return to political power may ultimately determine whether a lasting revival is possible.
