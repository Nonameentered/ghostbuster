Here is a draft essay of 3500 words in response to the prompt: "What are the consequences of 'eating badly' and how does it impact health and other areas of life?":

Our eating habits have a significant influence on our health and well-being. When we consistently consume unhealthy meals high in calories, fat, sugar, and salt but low in nutrients, this is known as "eating badly." Eating badly over a long period of time can have many negative consequences for both our physical and mental health.

Physically, an unhealthy diet high in processed and fast foods is a major contributor to obesity and excess weight gain. According to the World Health Organization, obesity has nearly tripled since 1975. Today, more than 1.9 billion adults are overweight, including 650 million who are obese. Obesity increases the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and some cancers. An unhealthy diet is also associated with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other cardiovascular diseases that can reduce life expectancy.   

Mentally and emotionally, an unhealthy diet can impact our mood and cognition. Studies show that diets high in sugar, fat, and processed carbohydrates but low in nutrients are associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety. Eating a poor diet also provides fewer of the B vitamins, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatory nutrients that are important for brain health and may lead to reduced cognitive function over time. Our diet even influences gut bacteria and the gut-brain axis, which can alter our mental well-being.

An unhealthy diet often becomes an unhealthy habit and relationship with food that is hard to break. Eating badly may lead to food addiction or dependency, especially on high sugar and high fat foods. It can be difficult to switch from eating highly palatable but nutritionally poor foods to whole foods like fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins that are better for health. Many people struggle with yo-yo dieting and a cycle of eating badly followed by extreme restriction, which creates additional metabolic and psychological stress.   

Beyond the individual, unhealthy diets also put a burden on our healthcare systems and the environment. Dietary diseases, especially obesity and type 2 diabetes, strain healthcare resources. Industrial agriculture and the mass production of processed foods also require more land, fuel, and other inputs, contributing to deforestation and pollution. A diet low in plant-based foods but high in meat, dairy, and processed foods has a much larger carbon footprint.

In conclusion, eating badly and consuming an unhealthy diet has significant consequences, ranging from reduced lifespan and quality of life at the individual level to broader societal impacts. The good news is that by making better choices and developing a balanced diet filled with nutritious whole foods, we can avoid many of these effects and improve both human health and the health of our planet. Developing healthy eating habits and a sustainable food system requires education, social support, and policy changes, but the benefits of doing so would be enormous.
