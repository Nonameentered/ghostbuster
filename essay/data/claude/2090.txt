Enslaved peoples in fifth century Athens were systematically dehumanized through law, social treatment, and cultural perceptions. At the time, slavery was an integral part of the Athenian economy and society. Slaves did not have basic human rights and were considered the legal property of their owners. They could be bought, sold, or even killed at the whim of their masters. 

Legally, slaves had almost no rights in Athens. They were not considered citizens and did not have access to the legal and political rights of citizens. They could not own property, marry, or enter into contracts. If a slave was killed, the penalty was a fine paid to their owner, not punishment for murder. The law primarily saw slaves as the property of the owner, not as human beings with rights.

Socially, slaves were treated with cruelty and contempt. They were given dangerous, difficult jobs and expected to be obedient and subservient. Slaves could be physically and sexually abused by their owners without legal consequence. Aristotle himself argued that slaves lacked self-control and intellect, justifying their enslavement and mistreatment. Slaves had no social mobility or means of earning freedom. Their lives were dictated completely by their owners' wills.

Culturally, slaves were depicted as less than human in Athenian arts and plays. For example, in Aristophanes' plays, slaves are shown as dim-witted, buffoonish characters solely for comic relief. They are mocked and belittled in the plays, reflecting widespread cultural attitudes. Slaves were not thought to have rich inner lives or intellectual capacity. They were seen as inferior beings suited only for service to citizens.

In conclusion, slaves in Athens faced immense dehumanization through the society's laws, social norms, and cultural representations. They lacked basic rights and protections, were treated with cruelty, and were depicted as lesser beings. Although slavery was foundational to Athens, slaves themselves were not considered full human beings with inherent worth and dignity. They faced immense hardship with virtually no recourse, demonstrating the totality of their dehumanization. Overall, slaves were profoundly deprived of their humanity under Athenian rule.
