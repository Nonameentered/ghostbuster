Here is a 750-word essay in response to the prompt:

The author describes their experience using participant observation to study deaf culture as an immersive and challenging process that required a steep learning curve. As a hearing researcher, they had to work to gain trust and be accepted into the deaf community in order to conduct their research. 

To start, the author had to learn American Sign Language (ASL) in order to communicate with members of the deaf community. They describe the process of learning ASL as “humbling” because it took concentrated effort to become fluent and made them feel like “an infant learning how to communicate all over again.” However, their efforts to become proficient in ASL were crucial to building rapport and gaining access to the deaf community. As they improved their signing skills, they were able to have more complex conversations and connect with more people.

The author also had to navigate cultural differences and overcome barriers as an “outsider” in the deaf community. They were entering a tight-knit community with its own cultural norms and had to be extremely sensitive in their interactions and research methods. The author describes feeling like they were “walking on eggshells” at times to avoid offending or alienating anyone. They were also confronted at times with suspicion and had to work to build trust in order to conduct interviews and observations. With time and persistence, the author was able to become a more active participant, but it was an ongoing process requiring patience, empathy, and care.

In summary, the key challenges the author faced in conducting their research were: 1) Learning a new language and assimilating into a new culture; 2) Gaining trust and access as an outsider; 3) Navigating cultural differences and barriers with sensitivity. However, by committing to the process of participant observation and immersing themselves in the deaf community, the author was ultimately able to gain valuable insights into deaf culture. With diligence and persistence, they overcame these significant challenges to complete their research.
