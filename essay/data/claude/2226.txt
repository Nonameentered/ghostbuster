Rationalism and empiricism are two opposing philosophical theories that argue about the source of human knowledge. Rationalism argues that knowledge comes primarily from reason and innate ideas, while empiricism argues that knowledge comes primarily from sensory experience. 

A leading proponent of rationalism was René Descartes. Descartes believed that the senses can be deceiving and should not be entirely trusted as a source of knowledge. Instead, knowledge comes from innate ideas and logical reasoning. In his work Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes formulates his foundational argument “Cogito ergo sum” or “I think, therefore I am.” By reasoning that even if his senses were deceiving him, he cannot be deceived about the fact that he exists as a thinking being. This establishes reason, not the senses, as the basis of knowledge. Descartes further argues that we have innate ideas of things like perfection, infinity, and God. However, rationalism faces the problems of reconciling innate ideas with diverse cultures and explaining the source of innate ideas.

In contrast, empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from sensory experience. Key proponents of empiricism included Francis Bacon and David Hume. Bacon emphasized observing the natural world through experimentation and induction to gain knowledge. In Novum Organum, he argues that preconceptions and innate ideas are "idols" that should be discarded in favor of an objective analysis of sensory data to understand the nature of things. Hume furthered empiricism, arguing that all knowledge comes from either sensory impressions or ideas which are copies of impressions. In An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Hume uses this "copy principle" to show that we have no innate ideas of things like perfection, infinity or God - rather, these concepts arise from experience and imagination. However, empiricism faces the problems of explaining how complex ideas arise from simple impressions and how scientific knowledge progresses.

Twentieth-century philosopher Karl Popper proposed a solution to these problems in the form of critical rationalism. Popper argues for an empirical approach but says that knowledge comes through guesses and conjecture, not observations alone. We propose theories and hypotheses and then try to falsify them through observations and experiments. For Popper, the source of new knowledge is not observations but problem situations that trigger us to conceive new theories. Unlike the rationalists, we do not have access to innate ideas or reason alone. But unlike the empiricists, observations are shaped by the theories we propose. Critical rationalism navigates between the problems of rationalism and empiricism, recognizing both reason and experience as crucial but fallible sources of knowledge.

In summary, rationalism argues that reason and innate ideas are the source of knowledge while empiricism argues that knowledge arises from sensory experience. Descartes and Hume represent key proponents of these opposing theories. Popper's critical rationalism provides a solution that utilizes both reason and experience as fallible but complementary sources of knowledge. These philosophies provide insight into fundamental questions about the origins of human knowledge and understanding.
