Embarrassment, shame, and guilt are all self-conscious emotions that involve a negative evaluation of the self. However, they differ in important ways. Embarrassment arises from a temporary social infraction in the presence of others, shame relates to a moral transgression of social standards, and guilt involves a violation of one's internal moral compass. 

Embarrassment is the least severe of these emotions. It stems from social discomfort and awkwardness, often due to a minor breach of etiquette or social norm in a public setting. For example, stumbling while walking down the street or calling someone by the wrong name in front of others can provoke feelings of embarrassment. The emotion is fleeting and diminishes once the social situation has passed or attention is diverted. The presence of an audience is key to experiencing embarrassment; it would not arise from the same behaviors in private. The purpose of embarrassment seems to be to motivate individuals to conform to social expectations, thereby promoting social cohesion.

Shame is a more significant self-conscious emotion arising from the violation of social standards that individuals have internalized. It relates to a negative judgment about the self, specifically a judgment that one is incompetent or unworthy in some way. For example, being fired from a job or rejected in a romantic relationship can elicit feelings of shame. Unlike embarrassment, shame can persist long after the event and does not require the presence of others. However, the expectations of society and social groups are still central to the experience of shame. The purpose of shame is to enforce conformity to moral codes of conduct and cultural values. 

Guilt differs from both embarrassment and shame in that it stems from a violation of one's internal moral standards rather than social expectations. When feeling guilty, one judges that a specific behavior was wrong or unethical according to one's own conscience. For example, lying to or betraying a friend can induce feelings of guilt. Like shame, guilt can endure long after the wrongdoing and does not necessitate an audience. However, the source of guilt is internal rather than social. The purpose of guilt seems to be to motivate individuals to behave in line with their own ethical principles in order to maintain a positive self-concept.

In summary, embarrassment, shame, and guilt are distinct self-conscious emotions that share the common feature of being linked to negative self-evaluations. They differ primarily in their source and focus, whether social, moral, or internal standards, and the severity and duration of the emotional experience. Together, these emotions help motivate individuals to regulate behavior in appropriate ways to function adaptively in groups and maintain a coherent sense of identity.
