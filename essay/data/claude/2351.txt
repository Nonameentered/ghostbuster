Molecular modelling refers to the use of computational chemistry methods and software to model and simulate the behavior of molecules at an atomic and molecular level. Advancements in computing technology and IT have enabled significant progress in molecular modelling by providing the high-performance computational power and software necessary to run complex calculations on large molecules. 

Molecular modelling software, such as Gaussian, Spartan, and HyperChem, allow chemists to draw and visualize molecular structures in 3D. These tools provide an interactive interface for the manipulation of molecular geometries by rotating bonds and optimizing spatial arrangements. They incorporate algorithms to calculate the steric energy, or the energy of interaction between atoms, to determine the most stable configuration of the molecule that satisfies electronegativity and minimizes repulsions. However, these semi-empirical methods make approximations in their calculations, using parameters derived from experimental data, limiting their accuracy.

More sophisticated ab initio methods, like density functional theory (DFT), can provide more reliable results. Software performing DFT, such as ORCA and PQS, solve the Schr√∂dinger equation to determine electron distributions and energies. DFT methods are computationally intensive but provide greater precision. These tools are critical for calculating molecular properties and modeling reaction mechanisms.

An example of a designed molecule is cubane, C8H8, a cube-shaped hydrocarbon. To model cubane, chemists start with a basic cubic carbon skeleton and add hydrogen atoms at each vertex. The structure is then optimized using molecular modelling software to minimize its steric energy. The optimization rotates bonds and shifts atoms to find the cube shape with staggered hydrogen positions that maximizes stability. The calculated structure and properties of cubane were confirmed through later laboratory synthesis.  

Another example is a nanorod self-assembled from organic molecules. Individual molecules with linking parts were modeled in 3D, then copies were replicated and translated in the software to find a configuration that minimizes energy through close packing and intermolecular forces between links. The model was used to predict how manufacturing conditions would impact the self-assembly and properties. Synthesis and imaging later confirmed the modeled nanorod structure.

In summary, molecular modelling utilizes IT and computational chemistry software to simulate the molecular world. Applications include modeling molecular geometries and properties, predicting reaction outcomes, designing supramolecular assemblies, and aiding drug discovery. Continued progress in computing and software development will enable more accurate and insightful models to further scientific discovery. With its significant potential, molecular modeling is poised to become even more crucial as a research methodology in chemistry and materials science.
