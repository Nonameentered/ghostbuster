To create a mobile phone-controlled buggy, several methods and components need to work together:

1. Physical components: At the core, the buggy needs certain physical components that enable it to move and be controlled remotely. These include:

- Wheels: The buggy needs wheels in order to move across the ground. Typically 2-4 wheels with rubber tires are used for a small buggy. The wheels are attached to motors that provide the power to spin the wheels. 

- Motors: Electric motors are needed to spin the wheels and propel the buggy. DC motors are commonly used for small robotics projects like this. The motors receive power from a battery and spin the attached wheels. By controlling the speed and direction of the motors, the movement of the buggy can be controlled.

- Battery: A rechargeable battery is required to provide power to the motors and any microcontrollers or circuits on the buggy. A high-capacity battery with adequate voltage is needed to allow the buggy to operate for a reasonable amount of time between charges.

- Frame: A frame, typically made of a lightweight yet strong material like aluminum or stiff plastics, is needed to house the battery, microcontroller, motors and provide a structure to attach the wheels. The frame protects the internal components and also shapes the overall form and size of the buggy.

2. Electronic components: Several electronic components are needed to interface with a mobile phone and process the signals to control the motors accordingly:

- Microcontroller: At the heart of the electronic system is a microcontroller like the Arduino. The microcontroller receives signals from the mobile phone via a wireless technology like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or radio frequency. It then sends appropriate signals to the motors to move the buggy as desired based on the commands from the phone.

- Motor drivers: Motor drivers are needed to translate the signals from the microcontroller into higher-powered signals that can drive the DC motors. The microcontroller operates a lower voltages that need to be amplified for the motors. The motor drivers take the microcontroller’s signals and generate the appropriate higher voltage signals to control the speed, direction and braking of the attached motors.

- Wireless module: A wireless module, like a Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or radio frequency transceiver, is needed to receive the signals from the mobile phone and pass them to the microcontroller. The wireless module allows the phone to communicate with and send commands to the buggy from a distance without needing to be physically connected.

3. Mobile interface: An interface on the mobile phone, like a custom app, is required to send the commands to the buggy. The app connects via the wireless technology to the buggy and allows the user to control movement by touching or tilting the screen, or pressing onscreen buttons. The app translates the user’s inputs into signals passed to the buggy to control it as desired.

To achieve a fully mobile phone-controlled buggy, all of these methods and components must work together effectively. The physical components provide the physical capability for movement. The electronic components handle the logic and signals to control that movement. The mobile interface allows a user to easily command the buggy by tapping and tilting their phone screen. With all parts operating together, the desired result of a remotely-controlled buggy can be achieved.
