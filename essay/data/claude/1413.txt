Globalisation has often been framed in gender-neutral terms, as a process of increasing flows of goods, capital, people, culture, and ideas across the world. However, globalisation has had deeply gendered impacts and has been shaped in fundamental ways by gender. This essay will examine four key ways in which gender and globalisation have been intertwined: labour force flexibilisation; structural adjustment programs; transnational migration; and global imperialism. 

Labour force flexibilisation refers to the increasing mobility and precariousness of employment under globalisation. This process has disproportionately impacted women in negative ways. Under globalisation, more and more work has become short-term, freelance, temporary, and part-time. While this flexibility benefits some highly-skilled individuals, for most workers it has meant job insecurity, low pay, poor working conditions, and lack of benefits or social protections. Women have been particularly vulnerable to these trends as they make up the majority of part-time, casual and temporary workers around the world. The dismantling of workplace regulations and the weakening of unions under globalisation have also made women more susceptible to exploitation. The gendered impacts of labour force flexibilisation show how globalisation has privileged some groups over others.

Structural adjustment programs (SAPs) imposed by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank on developing countries have required massive reductions in public spending, privatization of government services, and market deregulation. SAPs have struck hardest at government programs and subsidies that support women, such as public healthcare, education, childcare, and food subsidies. User fees for healthcare and schooling have made these services inaccessible to many women. SAP requirements to reduce budget deficits have also led to cuts in civil service jobs, where women make up a large share of employment. Thus, SAPs have pushed many women into more precarious and informal types of work to make ends meet. SAPs are a mechanism through which neoliberal globalisation has strengthened patriarchal structures in developing countries by exploiting and marginalising women.

Transnational migration and the globalisation of reproduction, carework and domestic labour have also had major gendered effects. The demand for cheap domestic and care labour in wealthy countries, combined with a lack of opportunities in poor countries, has fuelled a massive wave of female migrant workers around the world. Filipina and Indonesian women migrating to places like Hong Kong, Singapore and the Gulf States to work as domestic helpers and nannies provide a prime example. While remittances from these women are an important source of foreign exchange for their countries of origin, the women themselves face abuse, exploitation and lack of legal protections in their host countries due to their status as temporary migrant labourers. Their work also allows women in recipient countries to join the paid workforce, showing how the new global economy has been built in part upon the labour of poor migrant women.  

Finally, globalisation has been closely linked to the spread of global imperialism in both economic and cultural forms. This imperialism has been gendered, as Western conceptions of femininity, sexuality and women's roles have been promoted around the world through global media, corporations, and development programs. However, women have also been at the forefront of resistance to global imperialism. They have participated in movements against the imposition of neoliberal policies by international financial institutions; against the expansion of Western military power; against the spread of corporate globalisation; and for climate justice and food sovereignty. Through these movements, women have used the processes of globalisation to counter global imperialism with a form of "globalisation from below." They have linked women's groups across borders to advocate for alternative visions of globalisation grounded in social justice, environmentalism, and women's rights. These networks provide a basis for feminists to critique mainstream globalisation and articulate new possibilities for global solidarity and action.  

In conclusion, globalisation cannot be understood without analysing its interaction with gender. Gendered inequities are embedded throughout global economic and governance systems, even as global forces also shape social experiences in ways that construct and reconstruct gender identities and dynamics. Globalisation may be an inescapable feature of the 21st century, but as this essay has argued, it is a process that is neither inevitable nor gender-neutral. Feminist movements worldwide have highlighted the need to challenge the patriarchal structures within globalisation and advocate for more just forms of global interaction and exchange that promote the rights and welfare of all people, regardless of gender.
