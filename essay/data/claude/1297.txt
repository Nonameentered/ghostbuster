Hannah Arendt's concepts of labor, work, and action, elaborated in The Human Condition, provide a theoretical framework for understanding different spheres of human activity and their relationship to political and philosophical thought. For Arendt, labor refers to the biological activities that sustain human life, such as growing and consuming food. Work refers to the process of producing manufactured goods and creating a human-built environment. Action, most importantly, refers to the political sphere where humans can freely deliberate, communicate, and shape the world they share in common. 

Arendt argues that the rise of modernity has seen the steady encroachment of the social sphere of labor and work upon the political sphere of action. The growth of industrial capitalism and mass society have intensified the demands of labor and work, leaving little room for meaningful action. In contrast, the ancient Greek polis provided the model for action, where citizens could engage in purposeful political debate and decision-making about the community. Arendt sees Marx and Marxism as capitulating to the predominance of labor and work, reducing all human activities to expressions of economic necessity and material gain.

For Arendt, action is the highest and most distinctly human activity precisely because it is unnecessitated - it arises from our freedom, not our biological or economic needs. Action refers to the capacity of humans to start something new, to take initiative, and to bring something unexpected into the world through speech and deed. It is how we shape and reshape the human world we all share, in a constantly unfolding process Arendt calls "natality." Action requires plurality, the presence of others in our shared world, in order to be meaningful. It also requires a public sphere where community and policy can be debated. 

Arendt argues that when action retreats from the public sphere, when we lose our ability to start new projects and shape our shared world, the human condition itself is at stake. We sink back into the private spheres of labor and work, concerned only with biological life and economic gain. For Arendt, the rise of totalitarianism in the 20th century posed this threat, eliminating spaces for political action and plurality. The totalitarian state reduces human life to necessity and production.

In contrast, Marx saw human history as driven by modes and relations of production, centered on necessity and work. For Marx, politics, philosophy, and all social relations arise from and reflect the current economic system and control of the means of production. Arendt argues this view reduces human life to animal laborans, concerned only with biological and economic survival. By focusing so narrowly on production and necessity, Marxism overlooks natality, plurality, and the meaningfulness of action.

Arendt does not reject labor, work, and economics as unimportant, but she insists they must not displace the space of appearance, the public sphere of action where we shape our shared world. A meaningful human life requires all three spheres. But in modern society, with its focus on productivity, consumption, and necessitous life, "men have lost the world" as a space where they can act in a way that gives their lives significance and purpose beyond mere life itself. Overall, Arendt presents a theory of human activity that restores action and politics to a central place, balancing the demands of necessity and work with the freedom of plurality and deliberation. Her concepts provide a framework for rethinking the meaning of philosophy, ethics, and the good in society that is organized around action, not labor.
