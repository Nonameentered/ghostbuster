Here is a 500-word essay in response to the prompt:

Ultrasound waves have been investigated extensively in solid materials to understand their properties and determine various applications. Several key experiments have been carried out to study the interaction of ultrasound waves with solids. 

In the 1880s, the piezoelectric effect was discovered, showing that certain solid materials like quartz can generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress. This also works in reverse, with an applied electric field causing a mechanical deformation in the material. This key discovery enabled the use of piezoelectric transducers to generate and detect ultrasound waves.

In the early 1900s, ultrasonic pulse-echo methods were developed to measure distance and detect flaws in materials. High-frequency ultrasound pulses are transmitted into a material and echos are detected from boundaries or imperfections. The time delay between transmission and echo receipt can be used to determine distances and locate defects like cracks. These techniques are still widely used today for nondestructive material testing and evaluation.

In the 1930s, intense focused ultrasound was found to have physical effects on materials, leading to applications like ultrasonic welding and machining. When highly focused ultrasound beams are directed at a solid material, they can melt the material or cause cavitation damage, enabling joining, cutting, and drilling without physical contact. These techniques are useful for delicate materials where heat or contact damage need to be minimized.

In summary, key discoveries around piezoelectricity, ultrasonic pulse-echo measurement, and high-intensity focused ultrasound enabled many experiments showing how ultrasound can be used to assess properties, manipulate, and machine solid materials in useful ways. Ultrasound is a versatile tool for nondestructive evaluation, precision measurement, and contactless manipulation of solids that continues to enable new applications to this day.
