Here is a 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation in response to the Great Depression was a pivotal moment in American history that dramatically reshaped the role of government in society and the economy. The New Deal sought to provide relief to citizens, recovery of the economy, and reform of the financial system to prevent future crises. While the short-term goals of relief and recovery were largely achieved, the long-term success of reforms and the New Deal's impact on contemporary politics remains controversial and debated by historians.

The New Deal began with the Emergency Banking Act in 1933, which restored confidence in the banking system after widespread bank failures. The act stabilized the banking sector and allowed the economy to begin recovering. The National Industrial Recovery Act established codes of fair competition for industries, set minimum wages and maximum hours, and allowed collective bargaining, though it was later ruled unconstitutional. The Agricultural Adjustment Administration aimed to raise farm incomes by paying farmers to reduce crop production. These early policies provided much-needed relief and recovery, as unemployment fell by over 2 million from 1933 to 1934.

The second phase of the New Deal in 1935 included new legislation like the Public Works Administration to spur infrastructure projects, the Works Progress Administration to employ millions of unskilled workers, and the National Recovery Administration to set industry codes. The Civilian Conservation Corps employed young men in conservation projects. The Social Security Act established unemployment insurance and old-age pensions. These programs continued to provide relief and drive economic recovery. By 1937, unemployment had fallen to 14% from its height of 25% in 1933. 

Historians debate the New Deal's success in achieving permanent reform and its legacy on politics. Supporters argue that New Deal reforms like the Tennessee Valley Authority, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation brought stability and regulation to critical areas of the economy. Critics counter that the New Deal expanded government excessively, stifled business with overregulation, and failed to decisively end the Depression. The New Deal marked a clear expansion of government intervention that still shapes debates today.

In conclusion, the New Deal achieved substantial short-term relief and recovery, but modest long-term reform. Unemployment and GDP recovered most of their losses, but full recovery took WWII spending. New Deal programs like Social Security endure, but it failed to prevent financial crises like the Great Recession. Historians argue the New Deal either saved capitalism or marked its end, expanded government properly or improperly. Overall, the New Deal left a complex legacy that shaped American politics and society for generations. Its bold policies in a time of crisis allowed the nation to survive its greatest economic challenge, for better and for worse.
