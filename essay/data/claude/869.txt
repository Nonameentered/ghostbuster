European women played diverse and complex roles in the politics and rhetoric surrounding the empire-building project of the nineteenth century. Their views and participation varied considerably among different groups of women based on their class, political ideology, and proximity to colonialism.

Feminists and middle-class women in Britain were some of the most vocal supporters of empire. They saw the expansion of the British Empire as symbol of British progress and enlightenment. Groups like the Primrose League promoted jingoistic patriotism and believed the Empire showcased British superiority over “lesser races.” The popular women's magazine “The Englishwoman's Review” regularly featured heroic stories of British women in the colonies. These women helped spread propaganda about the Empire and advocated for its expansion and maintenance.

Working-class women in Europe, on the other hand, had a more ambivalent relationship to empire. While exposed to the dominant rhetoric praising the Empire, many also recognized how imperialism exploited both British workers at home and native peoples abroad. Their support often depended on whether they believed the Empire could provide economic benefits and opportunities for their families and communities. Those who emigrated to work in the colonies sometimes found improved living standards, but others faced difficult conditions and prejudice. Trade unions and labor activist groups were split on supporting or opposing imperial expansion.  

Women who lived and worked in the colonies also had a range of perspectives. White European women tended to support imperial rule, as they benefited greatly from the racial hierarchies that placed them firmly at the top. However, their support was often conditional on Britain's ability to provide security, infrastructure, and a replication of the comforts of home. Some advocated for greater oversight and protections of British women in the colonies. 

In contrast, native women in the colonies were almost universally opposed to European rule. Their opposition took many forms, from open rebellion and protest to more subtle resistance in their daily lives. Groups like the Calypso singers of Trinidad used their music to spread anti-imperial messages. While less documented, native women frequently participated in violent uprisings and organized boycotts. They suffered greatly under imperialism through loss of political power, land rights, economic opportunity and even basic human rights. Their opposition was fundamental to the ultimate collapse of European empires in the twentieth century. 

In conclusion, while European women were not monolithic in their views, many groups vocally supported and promoted imperialism in the nineteenth century. However, this support was often conditional, and working-class, native and colonial women frequently opposed empire in thought and action. Although less acknowledged at the time, these women were also instrumental forces in shaping the rhetoric and reality of European imperialism in the nineteenth century.
