Establishing a Muscadet vineyard and producing wine using the Sur Lie method requires several key steps and considerations. The first step is selecting an appropriate plot of land in the Muscadet region, which is located along the Loire River in western France near the city of Nantes. The soil in this region is ideal for growing Muscadet grapes, as it is composed of siliceous subsoils, schist, and chalk. These types of soil drain well and retain enough moisture for the grapes. The plot should also receive plenty of sunlight and have protection from harsh winds.  

Once an ideal plot of land has been identified, the next step is planting Melon de Bourgogne grape vines, which are the only grapes permitted for Muscadet wine. The vines should be planted at least 2 meters apart to allow for growth and ease of harvesting. They require the use of a trellis system to support the growth of the vines. The vines will not produce usable grapes for at least the first 3 years after planting, so initial establishment of a Muscadet vineyard requires patience. Careful pruning and canopy management is required over the lifetime of the vines to ensure maximum yield and health.

The grapes are usually ready to harvest in early autumn when they have reached 17-18°Brix, indicating they have sufficient sugar levels to produce a wine with 9-10% alcohol. During harvesting, the grapes are hand picked in small volumes to prevent bruising. They are then transported to the winery as quickly as possible for pressing into juice. At the winery, the grapes are gently pressed to release the juice while avoiding extraction of harsh, bitter tannins from the skins and seeds. The juice is then fermented slowly at controlled low temperatures, around 18°C, to preserve the freshness and aromatics. 

Fermentation may last 3-4 weeks, after which the wine is bottled immediately without filtration. This “Sur Lie” method, meaning “on the lees,” leaves the wine in contact with the dead yeast cells that remain after fermentation. This contact gives the wine a distinctive bready, yeasty aroma and richer mouthfeel. The wine typically spends 6-12 months with this lees contact before release. The end result is a crisp, minerally white wine with notes of tart apple, lime, and yeast that pairs excellently with the region’s fresh seafood.

In summary, the key considerations in establishing a Muscadet vineyard are selecting the right land, planting Melon de Bourgogne grape vines, carefully managing the canopy, harvesting at the optimal ripeness, gently pressing the grapes without excess tannin extraction, fermenting coolly and slowly, bottling quickly after fermentation, and aging Sur Lie to develop complexity. By following these meticulous steps, one can produce an authentic Muscadet wine that faithfully expresses the terroir of the Nantes region.
