There are several types of drag that act on road vehicles and affect their performance and design. The most significant are aerodynamic drag, rolling drag, and drivetrain drag. Aerodynamic drag is caused by the flow of air over and around the vehicle. The faster a vehicle moves, the more aerodynamic drag acts on it. This is because aerodynamic drag increases with the square of speed. Reducing aerodynamic drag is critical for improving a vehicle's fuel efficiency, especially at high speeds. 

Vehicle designers use aerodynamic principles like streamlining to reduce drag and improve performance. Streamlining involves designing vehicle shapes that allow air to flow smoothly over the vehicle with minimal turbulence. Smooth, rounded shapes like tear drops are the most streamlined. Designers also use aerodynamic aids like spoilers, air dams, and diffusers to guide air flow and reduce drag. Spoilers disrupt airflow over the rear of the vehicle, reducing drag. Air dams block airflow under the vehicle, reducing drag caused by air flowing underneath. Diffusers expand the area under the rear of the vehicle, allowing air to flow out smoothly and also reducing drag.

Race cars and other high-performance vehicles make extensive use of advanced aerodynamics. Their streamlined shapes and additional aerodynamic aids like wings, splitters, and vortex generators enable them to have lots of downforce, allowing them to travel at high speeds. The downforce pushes the vehicles into the road, allowing them to corner at high g-forces without slipping. At the same time, the advanced aerodynamics minimize drag so that they can reach high top speeds. 

Rolling drag refers to the resistance caused by the deformation of tires as they roll. It depends on factors like tire material, inflation pressure, and the weight the tires are supporting. Reducing rolling drag can improve fuel efficiency, especially at lower speeds where aerodynamic drag is less significant. Designers may use stiffer tire compounds, higher inflation pressures, and lighter weight materials to decrease rolling drag.

Drivetrain drag refers to the energy losses that occur as power is transmitted from the engine to the wheels. It can be reduced through efficient transmission and axle designs, as well as technologies like electric motors which have fewer energy conversions. Minimizing drivetrain drag improves a vehicle's overall energy efficiency and performance.

Vehicle designers and engineers utilize several tools to develop aerodynamic, efficient vehicle designs. Wind tunnel testing uses scale models to analyze how air flows over vehicles. Computational fluid dynamics or CFD uses computer simulations to model the airflow. Computer-aided design or CAD involves using specialized software to design vehicle models and then test them virtually using CFD before building full-scale models. These tools have enabled huge improvements in vehicle performance, fuel efficiency, and passenger comfort over time.

In summary, the three main types of drag that influence road vehicle design are aerodynamic drag, rolling drag, and drivetrain drag. Aerodynamic drag has the largest impact, but reducing all types of drag contributes to better efficiency and performance. Vehicle designers employ principles like streamlining, aerodynamic aids, and advanced tools such as wind tunnel testing, CFD, and CAD to create shapes that minimize drag and maximize performance. The results are modern vehicles with impressive fuel economy and handling at a wide range of speeds.
