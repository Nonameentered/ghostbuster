Second Language Acquisition (SLA) refers to the process by which people learn a second language after they have already learned their native language. There are three main factors that interact with and influence the SLA process: input, output, and formal instruction. 

Input refers to the language that the learner is exposed to, such as through reading, listening, and interacting with others. Input is essential for SLA because we can only acquire language that we have access to and understand. However, input alone is not sufficient. Learners must also produce output—they must speak and write in the new language. Output helps learners develop fluency, reinforces what they have learned through input, and provides opportunities for feedback and error correction. 

Formal language instruction, such as through classes or studying grammar books, also plays a role in SLA. Explicit teaching about the rules of a language and focused practice activities can help raise a learner's consciousness about the language and accelerate the acquisition process. However, formal instruction is not always necessary and in some cases may even be less helpful than naturalistic exposure to input and opportunities to produce output.

In my own experience learning Spanish, input, output, and instruction were all factors, but output and instruction were most valuable. I took four years of Spanish classes, which provided a solid foundation. However, I only began to achieve fluency when I spent a summer living in Spain, immersing myself in input through social interactions and media but also forcing myself to speak, even when it was difficult. I made many mistakes, but with time speaking became much easier and more natural.

On the other hand, a few years ago I tried to learn Portuguese using an app that focused mostly on input through drills and short lessons. While I picked up some vocabulary, I never achieved any fluency or comfort with speaking. Without opportunities for meaningful output, my learning stagnated. The experience reinforced for me that, while input and instruction are helpful, output is the most critical component of mastering a new language. For any language learner, seeking interactive, socially embedded opportunities to produce the language—whether through travel, friendship, or community participation—may be the key to overcoming obstacles to acquisition and achieving fluency.
