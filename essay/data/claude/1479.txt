Joseph Conrad's novella Heart of Darkness employs an unconventional narrative structure and complex character development to challenge traditional notions of progress and imperialism. Conrad rejects the simplistic idea that Western imperialists are entirely benevolent or that the expansion of Western trade and culture uniformly leads to progress. Instead, through his framing structure and the development of the enigmatic Kurtz, Conrad suggests that the imperial project is morally ambiguous and can enable the descent into darkness and savagery.

The narrative structure of Heart of Darkness, with its frame story and unreliable narrator, immediately establishes distance between the reader and the imperial project. The novella opens aboard the Nellie, anchored in the Thames, where five men listen to Marlow recount his journey up the Congo River. This frame story alerts the reader that the ensuing tale will be mediated through Marlow's subjective experience and interpretations. Marlow himself acknowledges the ambiguity and uncertainty in his story, noting how "in the immense confusion of all these voices...it is difficult to seize upon...anything definite" about Kurtz. The framing structure and Marlow's scattered narrative thus call into question the coherence and meaning of his imperial experience.

As Marlow journeys deeper into the jungle, Conrad's vivid and ominous descriptions further undermine the notion of straightforward progress. The Company's dilapidated station contrasts starkly with the ostensibly "civilized" Brussels headquarters that Marlow idealistically recalls. The impenetrable forest and treacherous rapids prove indifferent to the supposed advance of trade and culture. The "prehistoric" people Marlow encounters seem to mock rather than embrace Western modernity. Through these details, Conrad suggests the absurdity of imposing abstract notions of progress onto a world fundamentally alien and inimical. 

The most compelling challenge to imperial logic comes through the character of Kurtz, the enigmatic ivory trader.  Initially, Kurtz appears as a paragon of progress, with his eloquence, his piles of ivory, and his title as "universal genius." Indeed, the Manager and brickmaker lavish praise on Kurtz and celebrate the cultural and economic boons of his work. However, as Marlow journeys closer to Kurtz's inner station, this façade quickly crumbles.

In contrast to the triumphant reports from downstream, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has abandoned all restraint and descended into despotic savagery. The ominous skulls surrounding his station and his willingness to kill for ivory expose the moral hollowness of Kurtz's—and imperialism's—civilizing mission. Most disturbing is Kurtz's final descent, as Marlow finds him crawling on all fours and growling like a beast. With Kurtz's fate, Conrad suggests that rather than fostering enlightenment, imperialism may enable psychosis and barbarism.

Through his unconventional narrative techniques and troubling portrait of Kurtz, Conrad thus challenges the notion of imperialism as a self-evidently progressive or benevolent force. Heart of Darkness suggests that when individuals venture into places remote and culturally foreign to them, they risk losing their moral compass and even their humanity. Rather than spread light to the dark places of the earth, the imperial project may extinguish the light within. Overall, Conrad's novella stands as a sobering critique of the flawed logic of expansion for expansion's sake.
