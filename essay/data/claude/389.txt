Here is a 1000-word essay in response to the prompt:

Mr. He is a 35-year-old man who has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, a severe mental disorder characterized by disruptions in thought processes, perceptions, emotional responsiveness, and social interactions. The core symptoms of schizophrenia include delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking. Mr. He appears to be experiencing delusions of persecution, as evidenced by his belief that his neighbor is monitoring him and attempting to poison him. Delusions are fixed, false beliefs that do not change even when presented with conflicting evidence. Delusions of persecution are one of the most common types of delusions in schizophrenia.  

Schizophrenia is a chronic mental illness that affects about 1% of the population. The typical age of onset is late teens to early 30s for men and late 20s to early 30s for women. The aetiology of schizophrenia is not fully understood but likely involves a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Having a close family member with schizophrenia increases the risk, suggesting a genetic component. Abnormalities in brain structure and neurotransmitter levels, especially dopamine, have also been implicated. Significant stress or trauma during childhood or adolescence may play a role as an environmental trigger.  

Management of schizophrenia typically involves a combination of medications, psychotherapy, social support, and coping strategies. Antipsychotic medications, especially second-generation antipsychotics, are the foundation of treatment. They help alleviate symptoms like delusions and hallucinations by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. Psychotherapy, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, focuses on coping strategies, challenging delusional thoughts, and improving insight and medication adherence. Family support and community services also help individuals with schizophrenia function independently and reintegrate into society.

Ongoing management and monitoring are required as schizophrenia is a lifelong condition. Medication and doses may need adjustments over time. Hospitalization may be required during acute psychotic episodes. With proper treatment and support, many individuals with schizophrenia can have periods of stable remission and live successfully within their community. However, there is currently no cure for schizophrenia, so continued vigilance and management of symptoms are needed indefinitely.

In summary, Mr. He appears to be exhibiting symptoms consistent with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, notably delusions of persecution. Schizophrenia is a serious but treatable mental illness that requires comprehensive management to minimize disability and maximize quality of life. With a combination of antipsychotic medication, psychotherapy, and social support, individuals with schizophrenia can achieve stability and even long periods of relatively healthy functioning. However, ongoing monitoring and management are needed lifelong to prevent relapse.
