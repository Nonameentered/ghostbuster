What Meteorological Data Was Recorded on a Weekend Field Trip and How Does It Relate to Changes in Weather Over the Course of a Few Days?

Over the weekend of October 12-14, my environmental science class took a field trip to a local state park to gather meteorological data and observe changes in weather conditions over the course of three days. The park was located approximately 15 miles outside of the city, in a rural area surrounded by farms and woodlands. The goal of the field trip was to have students work together in small groups to set up portable weather stations, record data every few hours, and then analyze how the weather changed from day to day during our visit.   

On Friday afternoon upon arriving at the park, the weather was sunny with a few scattered clouds, approximately 72 °F, dew point 52 °F, relative humidity 47%, barometric pressure 30.35 inHg, and light variable winds around 5 mph. These conditions were typical for early October and showed high pressure dominating the region. As night fell, the temperature dropped to around 58°F by 10 pm accompanied by mostly clear skies and calming winds.

When we awoke on Saturday morning, a frontal boundary had pushed into the region bringing changes to the weather. The sky was overcast with altostratus and stratocumulus clouds and the temperature had risen to 66°F by 7 am with increasing humidity at 74% and dew point of 59°F. Winds had picked up from the south around 10-15 mph ahead of the approaching front. By noon, light intermittent showers moved through as the front passed, with temperatures dropping to 59°F, winds shifting to the west around 18 mph with gusts up to 25 mph, and barometric pressure falling to 30.10 inHg indicating the frontal boundary had brought a surge of low pressure.  

As the front continued eastward Saturday afternoon, a cooler air mass filtered in behind the system. Skies cleared again late in the day, with temperatures remaining in the mid 50s °F and winds diminishing below 10 mph. Saturday evening remained mostly clear and crisp with a low of 45°F. The dominant air mass was now continental polar, as indicated by the cooler and drier air.

On Sunday morning, we packed up our weather stations under sunny skies and temperatures rising into the lower 60s °F with light northwesterly winds. High pressure had built back into the region, bringing an end to the active weather from the passing front the day before. For the drive back home, it was a pleasant day with plenty of sunshine and temperatures reaching the mid to upper 60s °F by midday.  

In conclusion, the weekend field trip provided opportunities for students to directly observe and measure changes in temperature, dew point, humidity, barometric pressure, wind speed and direction, and cloud cover associated with the passing of a frontal boundary. Conditions transitioned from warm and humid ahead of the front, to cooler and drier behind the front, and then stabilized again under high pressure and clearing skies. Analyzing the data collected from Friday through Sunday showed firsthand how dynamic weather conditions can be and how they relate to temperature contrasts between air masses. Overall, the field trip achieved its goal of allowing students to experience meteorology in action through measurement, data collection, and analysis.
