Here is a draft 500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Skeletal remains provide many clues that can help determine the sex, age, and stature of the individual. For sex determination, some of the most accurate methods involve analyzing features of the pelvis and skull. In females, the pelvic inlet is wider, the subpubic angle is wider, and the sciatic notch is wider. The skull of females also tends to have less protrusion in areas like the glabella, mastoid processes, and mental eminence. 

To estimate age, several features of the skeleton can be examined. For children and teenagers, the state of dental development and the length of long bones provide good indications of age. As individuals reach adulthood, the pubic symphysis and sternal ends of the ribs become useful for age estimation. The pubic symphysis changes shape over time, starting as two distinct surfaces and slowly fusing together. Similarly, the sternal ends of ribs become more rough and porous with age. 

For adult individuals, additional techniques can be used to provide a more precise age estimation. For example, examining the auricular surface of the ilium can provide an estimate within about a decade. Changes in the morphology of vertebral centra and the extent of osteophyte formation around vertebral rims and joint surfaces can also help refine age estimates, especially for older individuals.

Stature estimation is typically based on measurements of the long bones, which correlate with an individual's height in life. Of the four major long bones (femur, tibia, humerus, radius), the femur and tibia provide the most accurate estimates of living stature. Regression formulas have been developed that can determine height estimates based on maximum femur length and tibia length. For example, the anatomical method uses the formula: Stature = K(Femur Length + Tibia Length) + C, where K and C are regression constants. More advanced methods using both leg bones can provide estimates within about 1 to 2 inches of actual height.

In summary, the pelvis, skull, teeth, ribs, and long bones provide the key to determining sex, age, and stature. Multiple indicators from these areas should be used together whenever possible to improve the accuracy and reliability of the biological profile of a skeleton. With well-preserved remains, an osteologist can often determine sex, provide an age estimate within a decade, and determine stature within a few inches, all of which helps in creating a more complete picture of the individual and their life.
