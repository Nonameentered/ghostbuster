Economic growth is determined by a combination of factors that increase a country's productive capacity over time. Robert Solow proposed that countries converge to a steady state of economic growth determined by the availability of labor and capital and the level of technological progress. However, Solow's model has been criticized for omitting human capital, an increasingly important driver of long-run growth. This essay will analyze an augmented Solow model with human capital to test for convergence across 54 countries from 1994 to 2000 using data on investment, initial GDP, and secondary school enrollment. The results provide evidence for conditional convergence and club convergence as predicted by growth theories that incorporate human capital and technology differences across countries.  

Solow's neoclassical growth model predicts that poorer countries with lower capital-labor ratios will grow faster as they accumulate capital and converge to steady-state growth rates determined by labor force growth and technological progress. However, empirical studies have found little evidence to support absolute convergence. The augmented Solow model proposes that human capital, measured by education levels, is an additional factor of production that determines a country's steady state. With human capital, poorer countries may face constraints to catching up, leading to club convergence where countries converge to differing steady states based on human capital and technology levels.

To test convergence, a cross-country regression analysis was conducted using panel data for 54 countries from 1994 to 2000. The dependent variable was the average annual growth rate of real GDP per capita. Independent variables included the initial level of real GDP per capita in 1994 to test for convergence, the average investment share of GDP from 1994 to 2000 as a measure of capital accumulation, and secondary school enrollment rates in 1994 as a proxy for human capital.

The results of the regression analysis provide evidence for conditional convergence and club convergence. The coefficient on initial GDP per capita is negative and significant, indicating that poorer countries grew faster, controlling for investment and human capital. However, the regression explained only 26% of the variation in growth rates, suggesting the presence of unobserved country-specific effects. When country dummies were included, the coefficient on initial GDP became insignificant, providing evidence for club convergence where growth depends on country-specific factors like technology in addition to factor accumulation.

The findings support the argument that human capital and technology levels shape a country's steady state growth and should be included in growth models. Poorer countries may face constraints to convergence depending on their human capital and institutions. The results are limited since human capital was measured using only secondary school enrollment, which does not fully capture educational quality. The time period is also relatively short. Nevertheless, the analysis provides empirical evidence that both conditional and club convergence are at play in determining economic growth.  

In summary, this essay analyzed an augmented Solow growth model including human capital to test for convergence across 54 countries. The results indicate that while there is conditional convergence when controlling for investment and human capital, country-specific effects related to technology and institutions also determine steady-state growth and lead to club convergence. The findings highlight the importance of incorporating measures of human capital and technology in economic growth models and recognizing that growth depends on a multitude of country-specific factors in addition to factor accumulation. Overall, the analysis demonstrates how growth theories that include human capital as a determinant of long-run growth help explain the diversity of growth experiences across countries.
