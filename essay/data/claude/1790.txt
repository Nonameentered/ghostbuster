The hamstrings are a group of muscles on the posterior thigh that cross both the hip and knee joints, enabling them to act as hip extensors and knee flexors. However, the biarticular nature of the hamstrings also means that their function at one joint depends on the position of the other joint. This interdependence results in a limited ability of the hamstrings to produce active hip flexion with the knee fully extended, known as passive insufficiency.

With the knee flexed, the hamstrings are able to generate considerable tension and actively flex the hip joint through a large range of motion. However, when the knee is fully extended, the hamstrings are already at maximum length and unable to produce much active tension, limiting the range of active hip flexion. This phenomenon can be demonstrated clinically by comparing the range of active hip flexion with the knee flexed at 90 degrees to the range with the knee fully extended and locked. With the knee bent, most individuals can actively flex the hip to 90-120 degrees. But with the knee straight, active hip flexion may be limited to only 70-90 degrees due to hamstring tightness and passive insufficiency. 

The clinical implications of passive insufficiency are important to understand for accurate assessment and treatment. Limited active hip flexion with knee extension could be mistaken as a hip flexion contracture when it is actually due to tight or short hamstrings. Treatment such as hamstring stretching or lengthening procedures may be more appropriate than hip mobilizations or capsular releases in those cases. Accurately measuring range of motion with electrogoniometry or inclinometry should be done with the knee flexed and extended to properly determine any limitations at each joint.

Several studies have examined the effect of hamstring length and passive insufficiency on hip flexion range of motion. Gajdosik et al. (1994) found a 58% deficit in active hip flexion with knee extension compared to knee flexion in 30 healthy subjects with tight hamstrings. Khandage et al. (2014) reported a mean loss of 21-24 degrees of hip flexion range going from knee flexion to extension in 60 young adult males. Both studies confirm that significant limitations in active hip flexion can occur with knee extension due to hamstring tightness and should not be interpreted as decreased hip mobility without considering hamstring extensibility.

In summary, the hamstrings' biarticular nature and passive insufficiency with knee extension can substantially impact their function as hip flexors. Accurate range of motion assessment and diagnosis of any limitations requires testing with both knee flexion and extension. Understanding this phenomenon and the relevant literature helps ensure appropriate clinical decision making regarding treatment interventions for loss of hip mobility and hamstring tightness.
