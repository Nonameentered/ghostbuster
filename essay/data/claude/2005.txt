The ancient oasis settlements of Oman, including Muqal and Bahla, present intriguing questions related to sustainability and land use management, especially given the arid climate and scarce water resources. These oases have survived for centuries due to ingenious aflaj irrigation systems that tap into underground aquifers and distribute the water throughout the settlement. However, the intensive agricultural activity within the oases has led to the buildup of salts that could threaten productivity if not properly managed. Several factors enable the continued survival of these oases, including the use of animal manure and the strong cultural traditions surrounding water and land use. Yet, population growth, economic changes, and shifts to commercial fertilizers also pose risks.

The aflaj systems, consisting of underground channels that bring water from aquifers to the surface, have been crucial for supplying the large amounts of water needed to sustain the oases. The water is distributed throughout the settlement in smaller channels, with each farm or garden receiving allocated amounts based on a schedule. These systems have allowed the oases to remain productive for centuries despite little rainfall. However, the constant irrigation has caused salts to accumulate, which could reduce soil fertility over time. Careful management of the water scheduling and amounts, along with the use of animal manure, has helped combat this problem so far.  

Animal manure, primarily from goats, plays an important role in maintaining soil fertility within the oases. The manure provides nutrients and also helps improve soil structure and water retention, counteracting the effects of the salts. The keeping of goats within the oasis also provides a source of food and materials for the farmers. This integrated agricultural system, using both irrigated crops and animal husbandry, has sustained the settlements for generations.

However, challenges to this system exist, including population growth within the oases, economic changes in Oman, and the increasing use of chemical fertilizers. As populations expand, the available space within the oases becomes more limited, and there is more pressure on resources like the aquifers. Oman's economy has also shifted away from traditional agriculture, so younger generations may be less inclined to continue farming practices like using manure. Chemical fertilizers are popular as they require less labor, but they do not improve soil structure or address salt buildup in the way that manure does. 

In summary, the ancient oasis settlements of Oman provide examples of remarkably sustainable agricultural systems, owing to the aflaj irrigation networks, use of manure, and strong cultural traditions surrounding water and land management. However, there are significant challenges arising from population growth, social changes, and modern agricultural practices that could threaten the long term viability of these oases if solutions are not found to balance both traditional and modern methods. Overall, the oases highlight how civilization can develop even in extremely arid regions with scarce resources through innovative and sustainable practices.
