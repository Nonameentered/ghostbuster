Here is a 1000 word essay in response to the prompt:

The aim of the experiment conducted on iron thiocyanate complexes was to determine the molar absorption coefficient of the simplest iron thiocyanate complex in solution. This was achieved by preparing solutions of known concentration of iron(III) ions and thiocyanate ions and measuring their absorbance using a colorimeter. By plotting a graph of absorbance against concentration and determining the slope, the molar absorption coefficient could be calculated according to the Beer-Lambert law.

To obtain the results, a solution of 0.02 M iron(III) chloride and a solution of 0.1 M potassium thiocyanate were prepared. A series of concentrations of the iron(III) solution were mixed with excess thiocyanate solution to form the iron thiocyanate complex and their absorbances measured at 460 nm in a colorimeter. A calibration curve was then plotted to determine the relationship between absorbance and concentration, which was found to be linear. The molar absorption coefficient is equal to the slope of this line.

There were several potential sources of error that could have affected the precision of the results. The concentrations of the solutions may not have been precisely 0.02 M and 0.1 M, influencing the absorbance values obtained. The colorimeter may not have been perfectly calibrated, leading to inaccuracies in the absorbance measurements. The solutions were not thermostated, so temperature fluctuations could have caused changes in absorbance. The solutions were manually mixed and poured into cuvettes, risking differences in concentration and volume between samples. These errors were attempted to be reduced by measuring and calculating concentrations carefully, calibrating the colorimeter, monitoring temperature and allowing samples to equilibrate, and being as consistent as possible in mixing and transferring the solutions. 

The simplest iron thiocyanate complex was determined to be [Fe(SCN)2(H2O)4]2+ based on the 4:1 ratio of thiocyanate to iron(III) ions and the octahedral geometry of the complex. The value obtained for the molar absorption coefficient of this complex at 460 nm was 4300 M-1cm-1. This result compares reasonably well with literature values, indicating the experiment was successful in achieving its aim and obtaining quite precise results for the molar absorption coefficient despite the potential sources of error. Overall, the experiment demonstrated the key principles behind determining solution properties like molar absorption coefficients using instrumental techniques.
