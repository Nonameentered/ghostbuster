Does Increased Trade Lead to Reduced Poverty? An Analysis of India's Experience 

India adopted more liberal trade policies starting in the early 1990s, moving from an inward-oriented policy of import substitution to a more open trade regime. The reforms started with the devaluation of the Indian rupee in 1991 and the removal of import licensing, followed by the gradual lowering of tariffs and removal of other barriers to trade over the following decades. The goal of these reforms was to increase economic growth and reduce poverty in India.

There is strong evidence that increased trade and economic openness have spurred higher economic growth in India. The average annual GDP growth rate in India increased from about 3-4% in the decades after independence to 6-7% in the 1990s and 2000s. While increased investment, education, and other factors also played a role, increased trade was an important driver of this higher growth. By gaining access to international markets, domestic producers could achieve greater economies of scale. Increased foreign competition also spurred innovation and improvements in productivity. These supply-side effects boosted economic activity and job creation in India.  

However, the impact of increased trade on poverty reduction is more complex. On the one hand, the higher economic growth spurred by trade openness has increased the overall size of the economy and average incomes. This has lifted millions of Indians out of poverty, especially in urban areas and some rural communities closely linked to trade. At the same time, increased trade has also created winners and losers, at least in the short term. Import competition has negatively impacted some domestic firms and the workers they employ. Farmers growing import-competing crops have also faced greater volatility in incomes. These distributional effects may have limited poverty reduction, especially in some rural and agricultural communities.

There is also an open debate on whether increased trade mainly benefits higher-skilled or lower-skilled workers in developing countries like India. Some research shows that trade openness in India has increased the demand for skilled workers, contributing to rising income inequality. However, other research points out that increased trade also creates opportunities for relatively low-skilled, labor-intensive work, especially in sectors like apparel, footwear, and electronics exports. India's large pool of less-skilled labor has allowed it to benefit from these opportunities. On net, it appears increased trade in India has likely benefited both higher-skilled and lower-skilled workers, though the gains have not been evenly distributed.  

In conclusion, while increased trade has been an important driver of economic growth and poverty reduction in India, its distributional effects are complex. The gains from trade have not accrued evenly across sectors, communities, and skill levels. Policymakers in India still have more work to do to strengthen the links between increased trade, growth, and poverty reduction. Investing in education, job training programs, and infrastructure can help disadvantaged groups benefit more from the opportunities afforded by trade openness. Targeted support for import-competing sectors may also be needed to smooth the transition. Overall, while increased trade has contributed to substantial gains, stronger policy efforts can help spread the benefits more broadly across India.
