Here is a 985-word essay response to the prompt:

The critical period hypothesis proposes that there is an optimal window for language acquisition, beyond which learning a language becomes more difficult. This hypothesis suggests that language acquisition is most successful during early childhood development due to biological predispositions to acquire language during this period. After puberty, biological changes and declining neural plasticity are thought to make language learning more challenging. The critical period hypothesis is often used to explain differences in L1 and L2 acquisition. The hypothesis argues that L1 acquisition benefits from the critical period, while L2 acquisition is disadvantaged due to occurring after this window.

There is evidence to support the critical period hypothesis. Children who are deprived of language during early childhood often struggle to fully acquire language, even after extensive exposure. For example, Genie, a child who was severely neglected and deprived of language until age 13, never fully acquired language despite years of tutoring and therapy. While she made progress, she struggled with complex grammar and her language abilities remained limited. This suggests that the critical period for L1 acquisition had passed, making full language acquisition difficult. 

In contrast, there are cases of successful L2 acquisition after the critical period, indicating that the critical period hypothesis may not completely preclude L2 learning in adulthood. For example, some adult immigrants become highly proficient in their L2, comparable to native speakers. However, on average, most adults do not reach native-like proficiency in L2. This could support a weaker version of the critical period hypothesis for L2 acquisition. The hypothesis suggests an sensitive rather than critical period for L2 learning - a period when L2 acquisition is most efficient but still possible, with greater effort and time, beyond this period.

The article provides a useful overview of the critical period hypothesis and its relevance to L1 and L2 acquisition for students of psycholinguistics. However, the authors could consider opposing views in more depth. While the authors argue for a critical period in L1 and a sensitive period in L2 acquisition, other linguists like Singleton propose sensitive periods for both L1 and L2, with gradual rather than abrupt declines in learning abilities with age. Discussing these alternative perspectives would provide greater balance and depth.

The ideas discussed in the article have some limitations. The evidence for a critical period in L1 and sensitive period in L2 acquisition relies heavily on averages â€“ it does not account for the significant individual differences seen in language learning abilities across the lifespan. The roles of motivation, opportunity, experience, and learning environment in successful L2 acquisition are underexplored. Future research could investigate these individual and environmental factors, and their interactions with any critical or sensitive periods. 

In summary, the critical period hypothesis provides a compelling explanation for differences between child L1 acquisition and adult L2 learning. However, the evidence points to a sensitive rather than critical period for L2 acquisition, and there are many individual exceptions. A balanced evaluation of alternative theories and consideration of individual and environmental factors would provide greater insights into language acquisition across the lifespan.
