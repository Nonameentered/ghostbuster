The selection of a structural section for a pre-fabricated roof member is a complex process that requires balancing several factors. The main factors considered include deflection limits, load-carrying capacity, weight, and size constraints. For a roof member being used in an interior space divided by glass curtain walls, minimizing deflection and overall size is particularly important to avoid impacts with the glass walls.

The deflection limits were one of the most important constraints on section selection. With glass curtain walls and aesthetic concerns, sufficient stiffness must be provided to avoid excessive deflection under full design loads and maintain the desired ceiling profile. Deflection also affects the behavior of the glass, as excessive deflection can put undue stress on the glass and curtain wall connections. To meet deflection criteria, higher stiffness sections like hollow structural sections or built-up sections with stiffening plates were preferred over open sections like angles or channels.  

The load-carrying capacity was also a key factor, as the section must be able to support the full range of design loads for the application without failure. Short-span and long-span roof members will have different capacities based on their unbraced lengths. Capacity is largely governed by the section dimensions and geometry as well as the yield stress of the material. Wider, thicker-walled sections and higher strength materials provide greater capacities. The capacity must be checked not just for the full design load but for a range of load combinations including those with reduced live loads.

Minimizing the overall weight and size of the section was also important given the space constraints. Lighter, more compact sections are easier to handle, transport and erect on site. They also reduce costs. However, lighter sections generally provide less capacity and stiffness, so there are trade-offs to balance. 
	
A performance index was used to objectively compare candidate sections based on these factors. The performance index considered deflection (60% weighting), capacity (30% weighting), and weight (10% weighting) to determine an overall score for each section. The section with the highest performance score was selected as the most suitable option. Other considerations like cost, availability, and constructability were then assessed to determine the final section choice.

In summary, the selection of a structural section for a pre-fabricated roof member in an interior space with glass curtain walls involved evaluating several factors and constraints. Minimizing deflection was most critical, but capacity, weight, size and other factors also had to be considered. By using a performance index to objectively compare options, the most suitable section could be selected, balanced with practical considerations, to meet the needs of the specific application.
