Here is a draft 1500-word essay in response to the prompt:

To what extent does the national origin of multinational companies remain relevant in the era of globalization? Discuss with reference to practical examples from various industries. 

Globalization has accelerated the international expansion of companies and the interconnection of markets around the world. As a result, some argue that the national identity and origin of multinational corporations have become less relevant. However, a company's country of origin continues to shape its strategies and business practices in important ways.

On the one hand, globalization has enabled companies to transcend their national origins and operate on a truly global scale. Technological advances have made it easier for companies to coordinate their activities across borders and serve foreign markets. Multinational companies today derive a large and growing share of their revenues from foreign markets. They build global supply chains, tap international talent pools, and adapt their products and services to local tastes around the world.

For example, Apple designs its products in the United States but manufactures them abroad and sells them in markets around the world. The company generates about 60% of its revenue from outside the United States. Apple's success depends on its ability to think and act globally without a strong allegiance to any single country. The same could be said for other technology giants like Google, Facebook, and Netflix that were born in the Internet age.

On the other hand, a company's national origin continues to shape its priorities, competitive advantages, and ways of doing business. Cultural factors, political and legal systems, and economic policies in a company's home country significantly influence its strategies and operations. Local institutions and values shape business practices in lasting ways, even as companies expand internationally.

For instance, German multinational companies like Adidas, Siemens and Bayer are renowned for their long-term thinking, high-quality engineering, and consensus-based decision making—attributes that reflect Germany's economic model. Japanese multinationals like Toyota, Honda and Sony are known for their lifetime employment practices, group decision making, and dedication to continuous improvement—practices stemming from Japan's post-war economic model.

In conclusion, while globalization has enabled multinational companies to operate across borders, their national origins continue to shape their strategies and business practices in meaningful ways. A company's home country instills it with certain competitive advantages, values, and ways of operating that persist even as the company expands globally. Nationality thus remains highly relevant for understanding multinational companies today, alongside their global ambitions and connections. Both the national and the global are crucial to understanding multinationals in the age of globalization.
