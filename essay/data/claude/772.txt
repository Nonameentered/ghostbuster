George Green was a largely self-taught mathematician who made significant contributions to mathematical analysis and the theory of electromagnetism in the early 19th century. Despite having little formal education, Green developed a highly original style of mathematical thinking that allowed him to derive key results that shaped these fields. 

Green was born in 1793 in Nottingham, England. He had little access to formal schooling and was largely self-educated from borrowed mathematics books. His first job was as an apprentice millwright at age 14. However, Green showed a strong aptitude for mathematics and his talent was recognized by local tutors who helped supplement his education. From his wide reading and intrinsic curiosity, Green developed a highly intuitive and visual approach to mathematics that was unencumbered by conventions. This allowed Green to think creatively about problems in mathematics and physics.

Green's most significant contribution was his theory of potentials, contained in his 1828 essay “An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism.” In this work, Green showed how to model electrical and magnetic fields using the tools of calculus and differential equations. He introduced the concept of potential functions to study electric and magnetic fields in a way that unified previous approaches. Green's theory of potentials allowed many phenomena in electromagnetism to be studied mathematically for the first time, opening up a whole field of mathematical physics. His ideas formed the starting point for more famous work by Gauss, Ampère, Faraday, and Thomson (Lord Kelvin) on electromagnetism.

Beyond electromagnetism, Green published several original papers in mathematical analysis that also made lasting contributions. His most notable work was in the study of boundaries and boundary value problems. The “Green's functions” and “Green's identities” named after him continue to be essential tools for solving partial differential equations in physics and engineering. Green's 1839 essay “On the Determination of Light and Heat” was also influential, containing theorems fundamental to the modern theory of light propagation and radiation.

Overall, George Green made pioneering contributions to mathematics and physics despite his unorthodox education. His highly intuitive style of thinking and ability to make conceptual leaps allowed him to envision groundbreaking ideas that shaped both fields. With little guidance from his nominal teachers, Green developed profoundly original ways of understanding mathematics, analysis, and the natural world that continue to resonate today. His accomplishments show what can be achieved by an unfettered and curious mind, even without the benefits of a conventional education or training. Green serves as an inspiration for thinking originally and creatively about complex problems.
