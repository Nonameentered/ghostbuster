Here is a draft 500 word essay in response to the prompt:

The weather during the 'Experiencing the Weather' field course at Leeson House over the weekend of 28th October was quite varied and changeable, evolving significantly over the two days of the course. 

On the morning of Saturday 28th, the weather was overcast and cool as the students arrived at the field studies centre. The cloud cover was thick, with no visible sun breaking through. The temperature was around 12 to 13 degrees Celsius, with a chill in the air, especially when the sporadic breeze picked up. The low pressure system that had brought rain to much of southern England the previous day was still lingering over the region.

By mid-morning, the clouds had started to break up, allowing glimpses of blue sky and sunlight to filter through. The temperature rose a couple of degrees as the sun's rays reached the ground, though the breeze persisted making extra layers still necessary. By lunchtime, the weather had turned mostly sunny and bright, lifting spirits during the outdoor activities and practical sessions on observing weather phenomenon like cloud types and formations.

In the afternoon, the variable weather took another turn, as a band of heavy showers moved in from the west on a cold front. The sunny spells were interspersed with downpours of rain, sometimes accompanied by strong, gusty winds. The temperature dropped again for a time. The rain finally cleared in the early evening, leaving a mostly clear night for stargazing activities under the waxing crescent moon.

On Sunday morning, the weather was sunny once more, with a lighter wind and temperatures a degree or two warmer than the previous day. The high pressure system that had moved in overnight brought settled, dry weather for the final sessions and activities of the field course before students departed after lunch. The changeable weather over the weekend provided plenty of opportunities for observing a range of conditions and making the most of the drier, brighter periods in between. The students gained valuable experience for their weather studies from the variety of weather they encountered over their short time at the centre.
