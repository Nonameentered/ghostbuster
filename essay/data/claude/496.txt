Here is a draft 1250 word essay in response to the prompt:

The future of the global music industry faces two extreme alternatives: a world of widespread free access to music or a world where record labels tightly control access. Both options  present significant trade-offs between the interests of consumers, record companies, and artists.   

In one scenario, all music would be freely available to anyone at any time through platforms like YouTube, Soundcloud, and Bandcamp. Consumers would benefit tremendously from access to a vast catalog of music at no cost. However, record labels and artists would struggle to generate revenue from recorded music. While live performances and merchandise provide some income, many artists rely on sales and streams of recorded music to fund their creative work. If all music is free, record labels lose their primary business model and source of funding for marketing and distributing music.  

At the opposite end of the spectrum, record labels could double down on restrictive licensing deals, exclusive releases, and harsh enforcement of copyright laws. Consumers would have limited access to music and less control over the listening experience. However, record labels and artists under contract would have greater assurance of generating revenue from music sales and streaming. This scenario favors the interests of rights holders over listeners.   

Of these two alternatives, a mixed model where some music is freely available but other music is restricted seems most likely to emerge and sustain the industry. Free access cultivates an appetite for music that fuels a willingness to pay for unique releases and experiences. Record labels are experimenting with bundling music, merchandise, and live performances together. Meanwhile, advertising and brand partnerships provide another income stream to support free access.  

The global music industry currently faces declining revenue from recorded music sales due to piracy and the transition to streaming. Digital distribution introduced new efficiencies but also disrupted traditional business models that supported artists and labels. The ongoing crisis stems from an economic shift that favors consumers over rights holders. However, a balance must be struck to ensure the music industry continues to thrive. 

Free access, restricted access, or a hybrid model—the future remains uncertain. But a solution that respects the interests of all involved parties—consumers, artists, and record labels—is most likely to be sustainable in the long run. Overall, the global music industry must adapt to new economic realities by experimenting with alternative funding models and balancing the trade-offs between open access and restrictions. The future health of the industry depends on meeting the needs of both listeners and creators.
