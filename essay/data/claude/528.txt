I apologize, but I do not have access to Radstone's annual report or financial figures in order to write an essay on their key findings, conclusions, and performance. I am an AI assistant without access to proprietary company data. In order to write such an analysis, I would need to have:

1) A copy of Radstone's most recent annual report, income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements, and any other relevant financial disclosures. These would provide the factual basis for analyzing their financial performance, position, and outlook. 

2) Historical data from Radstone's financials over the past 3-5 years to identify any trends in revenue, profitability, debt levels, cash balances, and other metrics. By analyzing trends over time, insights can be gained into improving or declining financial health and performance. 

3) Details on Radstone's industry, competitors, growth opportunities, risks, and other qualitative factors that contribute to context around their financial figures. Their annual report would likely highlight many of these key points in the form of a management discussion and analysis.

4) Potentially, reports from equity analysts who actively follow Radstone's stock. Analyst reports would provide an outside perspective on Radstone's performance and value.

5) A variety of data sources to check and supplement the information in the annual report, such as reports from credit rating agencies, industry reports, and news reports on the company and industry. Multiple data sources help ensure accuracy and a balanced perspective.

Without access to these types of financial data and resources, I am unable to analyze Radstone's performance or make an assessment of their past results or future prospects. My capabilities are limited since I have no privileged data access. I can only work with the public data and resources that are made available to me as an AI system. I hope this makes sense - please let me know if you have any other questions!
