Phylogenetic systematics, also known as cladistics, is a method for inferring evolutionary relationships between organisms based on shared derived characters. It uses molecular data to construct phylogenetic trees that represent the evolutionary history of organisms. To construct a consensus phylogeny tree at the molecular level, researchers first obtain DNA or protein sequence data for the organisms of interest. They then align these sequences to identify regions of similarity and difference. The aligned sequences are analyzed using phylogenetic algorithms and software like maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference to determine the most probable evolutionary relationships. 

The output is a phylogenetic tree with branching diagrams indicating how the organisms are related. The points where the tree splits into branches represent common ancestors. The length of each branch indicates the amount of evolutionary change. Closely related organisms share a more recent common ancestor and have shorter branch lengths. Reading a phylogenetic tree starts at the base, which represents the most distant common ancestor. The tips of the terminal branches represent the current organisms. By tracing a path from the base to the tips, you can see the inferred evolutionary relationships.

Some methods for constructing phylogeny trees include maximum parsimony, which identifies the simplest tree based on the fewest changes, and maximum likelihood, which determines the most likely tree given an evolutionary model. Bayesian inference incorporates prior probabilities and likelihoods to infer the most credible tree. Computational tools like PAUP, PHYLIP, MrBayes, and RaXML help analyze the sequence data and search for optimal trees. 

There are some theoretical issues that impact phylogenetic analyses. Evolutionary changes do not always accumulate at a constant rate, which can make some relationships appear closer or more distant. Horizontal gene transfer and hybridization can also obscure phylogenetic relationships. The choice of taxa, genes, and methodology can influence the tree topology. Using multiple genes and methods helps address these issues and increases confidence in the results.

Phylogenetic systematics has revolutionized our understanding of evolution. By providing empirical data on evolutionary relationships, it has confirmed many hypotheses about common ancestry, adaptation, and biogeography. As more organisms are sequenced, phylogenetics will continue to enhance our tree of life. Improved computational methods, incorporation of fossil data, and analysis of whole genomes will provide greater resolution and new insights into evolutionary processes. Phylogenetic systematics is a powerful tool for understanding the interconnectedness of life on Earth.
