This essay discusses an analysis of how Muslims are represented in the British press. The method used was a content analysis of six major national newspapers in the UK over a three year period from 2008 to 2011. The study aimed to investigate three main questions around how Muslims were depicted in these newspapers. The researcher was interested in understanding the extent to which Muslims were linked to extremism and terrorism in coverage. The researcher also wanted to examine how often Muslims were featured as central or main news sources or protagonists. Finally, the researcher was interested in exploring how often Islam as a faith and religious practice was portrayed in a negative light. 

The time period studied, from 2008 to 2011, was an important one in the UK that saw key events related to Muslims unfold, including terrorist attacks linked to Muslim extremists and debates around immigration and assimilation. The six newspapers selected - The Sun, The Daily Mail, The Daily Telegraph, The Times, The Guardian, and The Independent - represent a range of political leanings and readership profiles. They are also the most widely read newspapers in the country.

To conduct the analysis, the researcher developed a coding framework to categorize how Muslims and Islam were depicted in news articles and opinion pieces. Relevant articles were identified by searching newspaper archives for key terms like "Muslims", "Islam", "extremism", "terrorism", "mosque", "Koran", and "hijab". The analysis found a total of 1,760 articles relevant to the study in the three year period. Most mentions of Muslims and Islam were found in The Sun and The Daily Mail, which tend to have more sensationalized coverage aligned with anti-immigration and right-wing politics. The Guardian and The Independent, which are more left-leaning, had fewer instances of coverage but portrayed Muslims and Islam in a more neutral or positive light when they did feature in stories.

The results showed that across all newspapers, a majority of stories (61%) associated Muslims with extremism, conflict or terrorism. Only 14% of articles featured Muslims as central protagonists in news stories not related to conflict or terrorism. The Islamic faith was portrayed negatively in 52% of articles. The researcher concluded that there was a disproportionate and imbalanced focus on extremism and religious differences in media coverage of Muslims
