Here is a 467-word essay in response to the prompt:

To identify an unknown radioactive source, we can measure its gamma-ray energy spectrum using a sodium iodide scintillator crystal attached to a photomultiplier tube. The analog electrical signals from the photomultiplier tube are converted to digital signals and their counts are sorted by energy level using a multi-channel analyzer. The resulting gamma-ray energy spectrum has characteristic peaks that can be used to identify the radioactive source.

For this experiment, we obtained sealed vials containing  unknown radioactive sources and recorded a background energy spectrum with no source present. We then placed source vial #1 in the scintillator and recorded its energy spectrum. The spectrum showed a prominent peak at 662 keV, indicating the presence of 137Cs with its primary gamma emission at 662 keV. There were also smaller peaks at 32 keV and 36 keV for the low-energy gamma and x-ray emissions from 137Cs.

We then analyzed the spectrum to determine the attenuation coefficient for 137Cs. We calculated the number of recorded counts for each peak at 662 keV and compared the results to the number expected based on the known activity of the source and decay properties of 137Cs. The ratio of measured to expected counts gives the attenuation coefficient, which was 0.154 cm^-1. This means the intensity dropped by 15.4% as the beam traveled through 1 cm of the material. 

For source vial #2, the energy spectrum showed a single prominent peak at 1,173 keV and 1,332 keV, identifying the source as 60Co which emits gamma rays at those energies. The measured counts at 1,173 keV were 42% lower than expected based on the known activity, giving an attenuation coefficient of 0.258 cm^-1 for 60Co in the material.

The results for both sources seem reasonably accurate based on literature values, although there are potential sources of error, including uncertainty in the EXACT position of the source in the scintillator, which can differ from the measured distance and affect the calculated attenuation coefficients. The counts in the spectra can also vary somewhat due to random chance. Overall though, analyzing the gamma ray energy spectra from the unknown sources allowed us to identify the two radioactive sources as 137Cs and 60Co, and determine their attenuation coefficients with a reasonable degree of accuracy.
