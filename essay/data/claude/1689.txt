The Modernist movement in the arts sought to push back against traditional narrative styles and reflect the massive societal shifts happening in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In literature, Modernist works experimented with form and language to create new ways of representing human experience. Two examples that demonstrate the Modernist reaction are the Imagist poetry of F.S. Flint and James Joyce's short story collection Dubliners. 

The Imagist poets, including Flint, aimed to move away from the florid Victorian style of poetry dominant in the 19th century. They favored free verse and precise language to capture fleeting moments and sensory images. In Flint's poem "The Swan," he describes the bird briefly but vividly through concrete nouns and active verbs like "floats," "coils," "crooks," and "trailing." The effect is a series of crisp visual impressions that come together in the reader's mind. This push for concision of language and specific, stripped-down images typified the Imagist philosophy that poetic language should be treated as "a medium as definite as sculpture or painting" rather than a purely decorative device.

While the Imagists sought to revolutionize poetry, James Joyce took a similarly Modernist approach to reinventing the modern short story. In Dubliners, his collection of 15 short stories, Joyce moved away from traditional narrative arcs and moral lessons to present highly visual and somewhat disturbing glimpses into the lives of Dubliners. The stories are linked by themes of paralysis and epiphany, and they subvert the Victorian sensibility that fiction should be uplifting or didactic. 

In his story "Araby," a young boy describes his first crush and a late-night visit to a bazaar in highly visual, sensory language, like the Imagist poets. But while the poets imply meaning through images, in Joyce's stories, the reader must interpret a host of complex symbols. The exotic yet shabby bazaar reflects the boy's inner world as his vain hopes and idealized fantasies about his crush collide with the disappointing realities of the adult world. Joyce's approach is naturalistic, with life rendered in gritty detail, and this contributes to the intensity and emotional impact of his stories.

Both the Imagists and James Joyce were pioneers of literary Modernism. Through their experimentation with language and form, they strove to represent human experience in new ways that could better capture the essence and intensity of moments in time. Though their works were groundbreaking, they paved the way for subsequent generations of authors offering fresh perspectives on what constituted art and literature in the 20th century.
