Gerrard Winstanley's religious outlook was unquestionably complex, reflecting the tumultuous era in which he lived. The religious landscape of 17th-century England was fraught with debates around theology and ecclesiology. As a religious radical and social reformer, Winstanley's views spanned a range of controversial positions that continue to be debated today. Specifically, there are ongoing debates surrounding Winstanley's millenarianism, conception of God, understanding of the Fall and Restoration, and views on the institutional church.

Winstanley's writings suggest belief in a millenarian vision of a coming utopian era marked by social, political and spiritual transformation. His theology of spiritual rebirth and renewal was tied to his belief in an imminent age when Christ will reign on earth for a period of 1,000 years. While Winstanley stopped short of predicting a date for the millennium, he anticipated its coming within his lifetime and argued that immediate social and religious reforms were necessary to prepare. However, the precise nature of Winstanley's millenarianism and its link to his vision of social reformation remains contested. 

Winstanley's conception of God is similarly complex and debated. His writings suggest belief in an immanent God whose spirit inhabits all creation, rather than a transcendent sovereign. However, interpretations of Winstanley's pantheism vary. Some scholars argue his view borders on atheism, or a belief that 'God' simply symbolizes the laws of nature. Others counter that Winstanley upheld belief in a personal God who actively shapes history. Resolving these debates requires grappling with the ambiguities in Winstanley's own expressions of faith in a God who is both radically transcendent and radically immanent.

There are also debates surrounding Winstanley's unconventional understanding of the biblical Fall and Restoration. Winstanley argued that the Fall was an internal and allegorical event, rather than a literal fall of human beings from a state of perfection. Moreover, Winstanley believed the Restoration was an ongoing and incomplete process whereby people gradually gain knowledge of their own inherent divinity. However, scholars debate whether Winstanley's views represent a rejection of orthodox Christian teachings on original sin and salvation. There are also diverging interpretations on whether Winstanley believed the Restoration was a collective social and political process or a personal enlightenment.  

Finally, Winstanley's views on the institutional church were polemical and are the subject of much debate. While he condemned church hierarchies, creeds, ceremonies and clerical authority, Winstanley did not abandon his identity as a Christian. Yet his belief in religious liberty, spiritual independence of conscience, and radical egalitarianism led him to reject ordained ministry and the established Church of England. For Winstanley, the church existed wherever two or three were gathered in the spirit of Christ. However, interpretations vary on whether Winstanley sought reform of the existing church or advocated spiritual liberty outside the bounds of Christianity itself. 

In conclusion, Winstanley's religious radicalism poses more questions than answers, reflected in the range of viewpoints that persist today. As an iconoclastic visionary, Winstanley's thought was complex and idiosyncratic. While he rejected orthodoxy, his beliefs remain difficult to categorize or systematize. Thus, debates surrounding facets of his theology and ecclesiology are ongoing and likely unresolvable given the ambiguities in Winstanley's own writings. The complexity of his religious outlook matches the ideological tumult of the English Revolution in which his voice emerged.
