Here is a draft 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Qualitative researchers employ several methods to ensure the quality and rigor of their research. These methods differ from the techniques typically used in quantitative research, which focuses on measuring relationships between variables in a statistically significant way. While quantitative research prioritizes reliability, validity, generalizability, and objectivity, qualitative research emphasizes dependability, credibility, transferability, and confirmability. 

Qualitative researchers aim for dependability, which refers to consistency and transparency in the research process. They keep detailed records of the steps they take during data collection and analysis so that other researchers can potentially repeat the work. Questions that qualitative researchers ask themselves include: Are the research methods traceable and clearly articulated? Are the raw data, notes, and documentation well-organized and archived for review if needed? Dependability is analogous to reliability in quantitative research but recognizes that human behaviors cannot necessarily be measured in a consistent way.

Credibility refers to confidence in the accuracy of the findings based on the data collected. Qualitative researchers use methods like triangulation, member checks, and prolonged engagement to strengthen credibility. Triangulation compares multiple data sources, methods, and investigators to build a coherent understanding. Member checks seek feedback from participants to verify the researchers' interpretations align with participants' experiences. Prolonged engagement means spending sufficient time observing participants or engaging in interviews to gain an in-depth understanding. These techniques have no direct parallels in quantitative research.  

Transferability means the findings may be applicable to other similar contexts, though qualitative research does not aim for broad generalizability. Qualitative researchers provide thick descriptions with detailed accounts of the context so readers can evaluate the potential transferability to other settings. The researcher considers how representative the data is of the population in that context. In quantitative research, generalizability is addressed through random sampling and a sufficient sample size from the broader population of interest.

Confirmability refers to neutrality and objectivity in the findings. Qualitative researchers examine how their own assumptions and biases may have influenced data collection and interpretation. They consider alternative explanations and discuss any limitations or weaknesses in the study. Confirmability is supported by keeping detailed records describing the steps, decisions, and logic throughout the research process, known as an audit trail. Objectivity is a key criterion for quality in quantitative research and is enhanced through standardized measures and control of extraneous variables.

In summary, qualitative research employs dependability, credibility, transferability, and confirmability to demonstrate quality, whereas quantitative research traditionally focuses on reliability, validity, generalizability, and objectivity. While the methods differ, they share the common goal of producing credible and useful research findings. Qualitative and quantitative approaches can also be combined to provide greater insight into complex research questions.
