Lord Denning was one of the most celebrated judges of the twentieth century and made substantial contributions to the development of English law through his radical and intuitive judicial approaches. In particular, Lord Denning made significant advances in recognizing and protecting women's rights and interests, especially within the family and the home. 

In the sphere of matrimonial property, Lord Denning helped recognize and establish the concept of "equity in the home" for women. In the landmark case of National Provincial Bank v Ainsworth in 1965, Denning recognized that a wife had an equitable interest in the matrimonial home, even if it was registered in the sole name of her husband. Denning reasoned that the actions and intentions of the couple showed they meant to share the beneficial interest in the home, and he was willing to look behind legal formalities to determine the equity in the situation. This stance was radical for the time but has endured.

Lord Denning also made substantial contributions to the rights of deserted wives. In the case of Bendall v McWhirter in 1952, Denning held that a wife who had been deserted by her husband could pledge his credit to pay for necessities if he failed to provide for her. Denning stated that "the wife's position is not that of an ordinary creditor" and that a husband owes a duty to maintain his wife. This decision gave much more protection and provision for deserted wives who were in desperate need.

With regards to proprietary estoppel, Lord Denning was instrumental in broadening and liberalizing its application. In the landmark case of Ramsden v Dyson in 1866, Denning held that proprietary estoppel could apply even where there was no promise by the landowner, so long as the landowner's conduct had induced the plaintiff to believe they had or would acquire an interest in the property. Denning stated that it would be "unconscionable" to allow the defendants to deny the plaintiff's claim, showing his willingness to use equitable principles flexibly to prevent injustice.

There is no doubt that Lord Denning's radical and intuitive judicial methods were controversial and subjected to criticism. His expansive interpretations of the law and willingness to depart from precedent alarmed more conservative judges and lawyers. However, his progressive stance also made substantial achievements in recognizing and protecting women's rights. Equity in the home, rights for deserted wives, and flexible proprietary estoppel have endured and been built upon. 

On balance, while Lord Denning's judicial lawmaking was bold, his decisions in these areas can rightly be seen as progress that aligned the law more closely with general principles of justice, fairness, and equity. His rulings gave women more security and provision in situations where the strict application of common law had led to hardship. Although controversial, Denning's contributions to women's equity in the home were substantial, justified, and ahead of their time. Overall, Lord Denning's radical and intuitive judicial methods, for better or worse, shaped English law in a way that gave women more rights and justice.
