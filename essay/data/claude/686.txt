Ankle injuries are among the most common musculoskeletal injuries and can result from excessive forces applied to a static, stretched or moving ankle. The mechanism of injury in ankle sprains and fractures is typically excessive inversion, eversion, plantar flexion, or dorsiflexion forces. Ankle injuries can be classified based on their severity, with the most severe being ankle fractures.

An ankle fracture occurs when there is a break in one or more of the bones of the ankle joint. The ankle joint consists of three bones: the tibia and fibula of the lower leg which form the tibiofibular joint, and the talus. The most common ankle fractures are fractures of the distal fibula (lateral malleolus), distal tibia (medial malleolus), or talus. Ankle fractures often occur from excess twisting forces, such as when the ankle rolls over, and can range from minor cracks to severe breaks that pierce the skin. 

During the examination of an ankle injury, the ankle should be inspected for deformity, swelling, or bleeding. The ankle should be palpated to determine if there are any areas of increased warmth or tenderness. Range of motion and stress tests can also be performed to assess stability and pain. Radiographs, including anteroposterior, lateral and mortise views, should be obtained to assess for fractures or joint malalignment. Severe injuries may also require CT or MRI scans.

The management of ankle fractures depends on the severity. Minor or stable fractures can be managed non-operatively with immobilization using a cast or boot, rehabilitation, and progressive weight-bearing. Severe, displaced or intra-articular fractures typically require surgical fixation and a period of immobilization and non-weight-bearing. The goal of treatment is to achieve anatomical alignment and joint stability to allow for early motion and weight-bearing. 

Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) is commonly performed using plates and screws to hold the fracture in the proper alignment during healing. For intra-articular fractures, perfect joint reduction is necessary to minimize the risk of post-traumatic arthritis. In some cases, external fixation can be applied prior to ORIF to stabilize the ankle in the emergency setting. After ORIF, the ankle is immobilized and non-weight-bearing or partial weight-bearing for 6 to 12 weeks.

Early mobilization and weight-bearing is important to prevent joint stiffness and muscle atrophy. Range-of-motion and strengthening exercises should begin shortly after immobilization. Progressive weight-bearing as tolerated is encouraged once there are signs of fracture healing on follow-up radiographs, which typically occurs within 6 to 12 weeks. Physical therapy and bracing may also be utilized during rehabilitation to improve range of motion, strength and stability. Close clinical follow-up is required to monitor wound healing, fracture alignment, and post-operative complications.  

In summary, the mechanism of injury for most ankle fractures is excessive twisting or inversion forces applied to the ankle joint. Ankle fractures can range from minor cracks to severe breaks of the distal tibia, fibula or talus. Diagnosis is made through physical exam and radiologic imaging. Treatment options depend on fracture severity and include immobilization or ORIF and rehabilitation. Early mobilization and weight-bearing is key to optimizing functional outcomes. With proper diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation, most patients can experience good to excellent outcomes following an ankle fracture.
