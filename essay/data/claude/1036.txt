The music video for "Love is an Arrow" by Aberfeldy effectively uses multiple modes of communication to create a bitter-sweet story of longing and loss in a romantic relationship. The combination of music, lyrics, and visual images works together to deliver an emotive tale of hope, joy, heartbreak and redemption. 

The upbeat folk-pop music, combined with lyrics like "Love is an arrow, straight to the heart, love is an arrow tearing us apart," establishes an initial tone of new love and infatuation. The visuals in the opening scene reinforce this, with a young couple happily dancing and embracing. However, this joyous mood is short-lived.

As the music continues in a similar cheerful vein, the lyrics take a turn to themes of separation and anguish with lines like "miles apart but still joined together, memories provide stormy weather." Meanwhile, the visuals have shifted to show the couple now divided by a wall, attempting in vain to reconnect through small cracks and openings. The mismatch between the ongoing upbeat instrumentals and the increasingly sorrowful words and images creates a sense of irony and poignancy. The modes are working together but also in opposition, much like the separated lovers themselves.

The emotional climax of the story comes when the wall is finally breached, but only to reveal the woman has moved on to a new partner. As the man struggles to compose himself, a piano instrumental breaks through, highlighting a quiet moment of vulnerability. The simplified music draws focus to the raw heartbreak on display. At the same time, there is a glimmer of closure and peace found through seeing his beloved happy again.

In the final scene, the music surges back to the initial lively tempo and instrumentation as the trio dance together without boundaries or division. The visual of them coming together, combined with more optimistic lyrics like "love will mend these hearts again," leaves the viewer with a vision of friendship, acceptance and reconciliation. Although tinged with melancholy, the ending fosters a sense of hope - love has endured in a different form.

In summary, the multi-modal nature of the "Love is an Arrow" music video gives it a strong emotional impact that shapes our understanding of the song's meaning. The story is bittersweet but ultimately redemptive, brought to life through the intricate interweaving of upbeat music, poignant lyrics and visual drama. Each mode reinforces and amplifies the others, creating a cohesive and affecting tale of the journey of love.
