Strain gauges can be used to measure the force applied to a cantilever beam through the attachment of the gauges to the beam and the measurement of the change in resistance of the gauges. As force is applied to the end of the cantilever beam, it deflects, causing the strain gauges attached to it to deform. The deformation of the gauges causes their internal resistance to change, which can be measured using a Wheatstone bridge circuit. By calculating the known relationship between the change in resistance and the strain of the gauge, the applied force can be inferred. 

A cantilever beam is a beam that is fixed at only one end, with the other end free. When a force is applied to the free end, the beam bends and deflects. Strain gauges can be bonded to the beam to measure this deflection. As the beam deflects, the gauges change shape, causing their internal resistance to change. By measuring this change in resistance, the strain of the gauges can be measured. Using the gauge factor, the strain can then be related to the applied force.

The measurement system required for this setup includes two strain gauges attached to the cantilever beam, a Wheatstone bridge, an operational amplifier, and a low-pass filter. The two strain gauges are connected as part of a Wheatstone bridge circuit, with the bridge used to measure the change in resistance of the gauges. The operational amplifier is used to amplify the output of the Wheatstone bridge to provide a voltage signal proportional to the applied force. The low-pass filter removes high-frequency noise from this signal.

Using two strain gauges on opposite sides of the beam increases the sensitivity of the system. As force is applied, one gauge is in tension and experiences an increase in resistance, while the other is in compression and sees a decrease in resistance. By measuring the difference between these two resistances, the effects of temperature changes on the gauges can be cancelled out. The total change in resistance is thus proportional to only the applied strain. The voltage output from the Wheatstone bridge is proportional to this total change in resistance and thus to the applied force.

The range of the force sensor depends on the material properties and dimensions of the cantilever beam. The Young's modulus of the beam material determines how much it will deflect under an applied force. The higher the Young's modulus, the stiffer the beam is, and the less deflection will be seen for the same applied force. The fatigue strength of the material places an upper limit on the forces that can be applied before the beam permanently deforms. Within these limits, the range of the sensor can be increased by using a more flexible beam material or by increasing the length of the beam.

In conclusion, strain gauges bonded to a cantilever beam can be used to measure applied forces by relating the change in resistance of the gauges to the beam deflection. A measurement system using a Wheatstone bridge and amplifier can provide an output voltage proportional to the applied force. By using two gauges and calculating limits based on the mechanical properties of the beam, a sensitive force sensor with a well-defined range can be constructed. Strain gauges provide a simple method of measuring forces in a variety of engineering applications.
