The basic steps in cheese manufacturing, specifically for soft cheeses, are quite standardized. First, raw milk is collected from cows, goats, or sheep and is standardized to the desired fat and solids content. Next, starter cultures of bacteria as well as rennet which contains enzymes to coagulate the milk, are added to the milk. The milk is then left to coagulate, a process that uses enzymes and acidification by the bacterial cultures to cause the milk proteins, caseins, to form a gel. 

Once the milk has coagulated into curds and whey, the curds are then cut into small cubes to promote whey expulsion, known as syneresis. The factors that affect syneresis and the properties of the final cheese product include the size of the curd cuts, the temperature of the curds, the amount of stirring or agitation, the acidity level, and the amount of rennet added. Smaller curd cuts and higher temperatures will result in more whey expulsion due to the increased surface area of the curd particles. More stirring and agitation as well as higher acidity will also speed up syneresis. A higher amount of added rennet will produce a firmer, drier curd.  

The curds are then cooked, stirred, and drained. During drainage, the curds are placed in perforated molds or draining cloth to allow whey to drain from the curds through gravity. The curds are then often pressed to further remove whey and shape the final cheese product. Salting, ripening, and ripening are then carried out depending on the type of cheese. The cheeses are packaged and distributed once the ripening process is complete.

During this entire cheese making process, the milk composition changes dramatically. The milk transitions from a liquid to a solid through coagulation. As the curds are cut and drained, the whey contains water, lactose, soluble proteins, and minerals. The curds contain fat, caseins, calcium phosphate, and trapped whey. When the curds are pressed and aged, lactic acid bacteria ferment the lactose into lactic acid, lowering the pH. Proteins and fats are broken down, and new compounds that contribute to the flavor and texture of the aged cheese are formed. The final cheese contains concentrated levels of fat, protein, calcium, phosphorus, and cheese flavors and aromas developed during ripening. In the end, cheese making transforms a perishable liquid, milk, into a stable, nutritious food that can be enjoyed for months.

In summary, the basic steps in soft cheese making involve the coagulation of milk, followed by curd cutting, cooking, stirring, draining, salting, and ripening the curds. The rate of syneresis can be controlled by various factors like curd cut size, temperature, agitation, acidity, and rennet amount, which then impact the characteristics of the final cheese. During the entire process, the nutritional and chemical composition of the milk changes dramatically through the transformation to curds and whey and finally into the finished cheese product.
