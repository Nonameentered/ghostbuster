Here is a 1980 word essay in response to the prompt:

The concept of Smithian self-love refers to Adam Smith's view of human motivation outlined in his seminal work The Theory of Moral Sentiments. For Smith, self-love meant that individuals are motivated by an innate desire to be the praiseworthy and virtuous object of affections and sentiments. This type of self-love contrasts sharply with the narrow view of self-interest that economists often assume - that individuals are solely motivated to maximize their own material gains and benefits. 

Smith argued that human beings have a fundamental drive to be the object of praise and worthy of the favorable sentiments of others. We seek the affection, approval and esteem of our peers and those around us. Smith saw this desire as arising from our ability to imaginatively project ourselves into the perspectives of others and judge ourselves through their eyes. We can view ourselves "with the eyes of other people" and develop a sense of how we must appear to them. This capacity that Smith termed the "impartial spectator" generates an innate interest in cultivating virtuous qualities that would make us worthy of the esteem and approbation of others.

In pursuing the praise and approbation of others, individuals are motivated to act in ways aligned with virtue and propriety. Smith argues that it is the desire to be praiseworthy, not solely the pursuit of narrow self-interest, that naturally leads human beings to restrain their selfishness and act with some degree of care and concern for others. In this view, individuals can act with what Smith calls "sympathy" for the situations of others and modify their own behavior to win the praise and affection of the impartial spectator.

Smithian self-love therefore challenges the notion that self-interest alone can explain human economic decision making or social interaction. While individuals do seek their own good, for Smith they do so in a way that also shows care and consideration for others. The human desire to be worthy of praise leads to behavior that is not simply selfish but also aimed at virtue, propriety and the common good. Smith saw these moral sentiments, not self-interest, as the glue that binds society together and makes social coexistence and cooperation possible.

In conclusion, Smithian self-love provides a more expansive view of human motivation that incorporates both self-interest as well as the innate human desire to cultivate virtuous qualities worthy of esteem and praise. This concept challenges the simplistic notion that humans are solely motivated by narrow self-interest maximization. For Smith, the impartial spectator and desire to be praiseworthy generate sympathetic and virtuous behaviors that shape human decision making in ways not captured by the standard model of economic self-interest.
