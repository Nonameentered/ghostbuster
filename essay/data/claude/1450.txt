Modernism was a cultural movement that spanned the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Modernist authors grappled with many social changes occurring in the era, including changing gender roles for women. There were conflicting ideas about the role of women in society and culture during this time. Some embraced more traditional gender norms, while others advocated for more freedom and independence for women. These conflicting views were reflected in the works of modernist authors. 

Some male modernist authors portrayed women in more traditional submissive roles. In Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, published in 1902, the main character Marlow makes several misogynistic comments about women, referring to them as "guardian[s] of the fire" meant simply to attend to men's basic needs. The women characters in the novella are minor and only discussed briefly in passing. D.H. Lawrence also frequently portrayed women as intellectually and emotionally inferior to men in his works like Sons and Lovers, published in 1913. His female characters are often uneducated and dependent on men. For these authors, women were meant to remain in the domestic sphere, subservient to and cared for by men.  

In contrast, other modernist authors celebrated the emergence of the "New Woman" - women who were freed from many of the restrictions of traditional gender norms. Prominent female modernist authors like Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield created complex female characters in their works who grapple with their independence and search for meaning beyond traditional feminine roles. 

In her seminal work A Room of One's Own, published in 1929, Woolf argued that in order for women to achieve artistic excellence like men, they need financial independence and "a room of their own" - a literal and figurative space for creativity free from societal constraints. Her own novels like Mrs. Dalloway, published in 1925, featured independent and intellectual female protagonists exploring their identity in post-WWI society. 

Mansfield's short stories frequently focused on the inner lives of women and their struggles in navigating new social terrain. Her stories like "The Daughters of the Late Colonel" and "The Garden Party" published in 1922, provide social commentary on the limited choices available to women in early 20th-century society, often conveyed through her poetic and vivid writing style.

In conclusion, there were a diversity of views on women's roles in modernist literature. While some male authors advocated for more traditional roles for women, other prominent female modernist authors celebrated independent and free-thinking women who grappled with complex issues of identity, relationships, and meaning in a changing world. The variety of perspectives on women evident in modernist works revealed the tensions, uncertainties, and transitions in gender dynamics occurring during the early 20th century.
