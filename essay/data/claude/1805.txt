Defining Standard English 

Standard English refers to a dialect of English that is considered by some to be the most prestigious or correct form of the language. However, defining exactly what constitutes Standard English is complex, as there are many factors that influence how it is conceptualized, including accent, style, register, and social position. Linguists like Peter Trudgill, James Milroy, and Lesley Milroy have examined Standard English from different perspectives, highlighting the complexity involved in pinning down a precise definition of this dialect.

Accent is one factor that influences definitions of Standard English. Traditionally, Standard English accent is associated with Received Pronunciation, the accent of upper class speakers in southern England. This accent is often portrayed as the most correct or proper form of English. However, Trudgill argues that there are many equally complex and systematic accents of English, and that there is nothing inherently superior about Received Pronunciation. He claims it is an arbitrary standard that has gained prestige for social and political reasons. If accent alone does not define Standard English, other factors like style, register, and social position must also be considered.

Style refers to choices in vocabulary and grammar that create a particular tone or effect. Standard English is often associated with a formal style in both speaking and writing. However, styles are diverse and depend heavily on context. As the Milroys point out, even formal styles cannot be reduced to a single type, as academic writing is very different from legal or religious writing. They argue that Standard English exists as a range of styles and registers, not a single monolithic form. Register also depends on context, referring to the level of formality in language depending on factors like audience and purpose. The Milroys observe that registers of English, from informal speech to formal writing, shift along a continuum. While formal registers may be more closely associated with Standard English, informal registers are also systematically complex languages in their own right. 

Finally, social position influences conceptualizations of Standard English. Historically, upper class speakers have been viewed as the model for Standard English, while working class speakers are often portrayed as somehow substandard. However, Trudgill argues there is nothing inherently superior about upper class English. He claims that all classes and dialects are linguistically equal, though social and political factors have resulted in the prestige of certain groups. The Milroys also point out that the connection between social position and language is complex. While social status may influence the registers and styles a speaker uses, there are exceptions, and speech also depends on factors like a speaker's region, ethnicity, and education.

In summary, there are many perspectives on defining Standard English, and there is no universal agreement on a precise definition. However, most linguists argue that it should not be viewed as a single superior dialect, but rather as a range of complex registers, styles, and accents, all of which depend heavily on social context. While certain formal registers and the speech of some social groups may be more closely associated with dominant concepts of Standard English, no single way of speaking is inherently more correct or prestigious. All dialects and styles of English should be valued as rule-governed, complex language systems in their own right.
