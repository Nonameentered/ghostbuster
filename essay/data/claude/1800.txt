The lexicon is the total set of words and word forms in a language. How words are organised and structured in the lexicon has been an important area of study in linguistics. There are three main approaches that have been taken to understand lexical organisation: lexicalization, sense relations, and lexical composition. 

The first approach, lexicalization, examines how concepts and meanings become mapped to words. Languages differ in terms of what concepts they choose to map to single words versus phrases. For example, the concept of 'brother's wife' is lexicalized as a single word 'sister-in-law' in English but requires a phrase in other languages. Languages also differ in terms of at what level of specificity they lexicalize concepts. Some languages like Nuuchahnulth, an indigenous language of Canada, have very specific words for particular types of snow, while English has just one general word 'snow'. Studying lexicalization reveals insights into how speakers of a language categorize the world.

The second approach looks at the semantic relationships between words and their senses, known as sense relations. Important sense relations include synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy, and meronymy. Synonyms are words that share the same or very similar meanings, like 'large' and 'big'. Antonyms are words with opposite meanings, like 'hot' and 'cold'. Hyponyms are words with more specific meanings, like 'dog' is a hyponym of 'animal'. And meronyms are words that represent parts of a whole, like 'finger' is a meronym of 'hand'. By examining sense relations, we can understand the semantic structure and organisation of lexicon.  

The third approach, lexical composition, examines how words themselves are composed of smaller meaning-bearing elements. In English, this includes prefixes, roots, and suffixes. For example, the word 'unhelpfulness' contains the prefix 'un-', the root 'help', the suffix '-ful' and another suffix '-ness'. Morphemes like these are combined according to the morphological rules of a language to create new words. Studying how words can be decomposed into morphemes and the constraints on morpheme combination provides insight into the generative capacity of a language's lexicon.

In summary, the lexicalization approach looks at how meanings relate to single words. The sense relations approach examines how words are semantically connected. And the lexical composition approach focuses on how smaller meaning-bearing elements can be combined into words. Together these three approaches provide a multi-faceted understanding of lexical organisation from the perspectives of theoretical and descriptive linguists. They reveal both the diversity of lexical structures across languages as well as the shared organising principles that cut across them.
