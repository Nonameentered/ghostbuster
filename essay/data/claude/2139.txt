Corpus-based analysis of the patterns and meanings of verbs in English provides significant insights into how verbs are used in the language. By examining a large collection of examples of actual language use, linguists can identify the contextual patterns in which verbs appear and the range of meanings they convey. These analyses show that verbs in English exhibit complex behaviors and multiple senses that are highly dependent on the contexts in which they are used. 

One key finding from corpus-based studies is that verbs frequently appear in recurrent patterns with other words. These patterns, known as collocations, show the company that verbs typically keep. For example, the verb "make" has high collocation with words such as "decision," "mistake," "choice," and "difference," indicating that it is often used in the context of choosing or determining something. The verb "take" frequently collocates with "action," "responsibility," "steps," and "measures," showing its use in expressions relating to responding to a situation. These collocational patterns point to the typical phrases and constructions in which verbs are employed. They highlight the links between the meanings and patterns of verbs in natural language use.

In addition to collocations, verbs also exhibit preferences for particular grammatical contexts. Corpus analyses reveal that verbs select for certain subjects, objects, prepositions, and other elements. For instance, the verb "give" strongly prefers animate subjects and objects, indicating its use in expressing transfers between people. The verb "depend" favors prepositional phrases with "on" or grammatical objects with "for," reflecting its meaning relating to relying on someone or something for something else. The patterns of grammar that verbs select for are directly connected to their semantic roles and functions. Corpus studies make these connections visible through hundreds of examples from authentic language data.

Furthermore, corpus-based research shows that many verbs in English have multiple, related senses. Rather than having discrete definitions, the meanings of verbs exist on a continuum and blend into one another. The verb "see," for instance, can express senses ranging from literal vision, to understanding, to experiencing, depending on the context. Its meaning is highly dependent on the subject and object of the clause, the prepositions that follow, and other grammatical details. Other verbs like "get," "make," "take," and "put" also have a multitude of senses that merge and shade into one another, as revealed through corpus analysis of their patterns of use. The meanings of these versatile verbs are remarkably adaptable to their linguistic context.

In conclusion, corpus-based investigations of English verbs demonstrate that meaning is deeply embedded in patterns of use. Recurrent collocations, preferred grammatical contexts, and networks of related senses all point to the inseparable connections between the semantics of verbs and the contexts in which they appear. The uses and interpretations of verbs depend profoundly on the other words and structures that surround them. By starting from a corpus of natural language data, linguists can map these complex relationships between the patterns and meanings in English verbs.
