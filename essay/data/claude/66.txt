Avoidance coping strategies, such as denial, distraction, and escape, aim to reduce distress through disengaging from a stressful situation or the emotions it elicits. This is in contrast to more active coping strategies like problem-focused coping, which aims to directly resolve the source of distress, or emotion-focused coping, which seeks to regulate distressing emotions. There is evidence that avoidance coping is associated with higher levels of alcohol consumption, especially in student populations where stress levels are often high but resources are limited. While avoidance coping and alcohol use may provide temporary relief from distress, they are maladaptive in the long run and can have significant negative impacts on both mental health and academic success.

Problem-focused coping involves actively and logically addressing the root causes of a stressful situation. This could involve planning, calculating risks and benefits, researching solutions, or confronting the issues directly. For students, this might include strategies like time management to reduce academic worries, communicating with professors to clarify expectations, or making a realistic study schedule to prepare for exams. Problem-focused coping tends to lead to better outcomes since the underlying issues are resolved. However, it requires time, resources, and the correct mindset to implement, which may be lacking during periods of high distress.

Emotion-focused coping aims to reduce negative emotional reactions to stress through seeking social support or by practicing mindfulness strategies like deep breathing, exercise, or yoga. These coping options help to alleviate distress in the short term and can enhance long-term coping. However, these strategies do not actually address the source of the problem and therefore the negative emotions are likely to recur. Some potential downsides of emotion-focused coping include creating reliance on temporary fixes and avoidance rather than dealing with the root issues causing the stress.

In contrast to these active coping styles, avoidance coping leads to disengaging from stressors or the emotions they elicit as a way of reducing distress. Common strategies include denial, distraction, social withdrawal and escapism. These options provide immediate relief but worsen outcomes in the long run as problems persist and often accumulate. Higher stress levels also tend to recur over time since the coping is temporary. Excessive alcohol consumption is a form of avoidance coping that some students may turn to in order reduce worries or negative emotions.
