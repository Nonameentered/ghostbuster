Comparison and Analysis of Spoken Discourse Using Ethnography of Speaking 

To compare and contrast examples of spoken discourse, several methods can be employed. The most important first step is to transcribe the audio recordings of the conversations or speeches into written text. Transcription involves noting details such as pauses, vocalizations, interruptions, and overlaps in talk to capture the authentic qualities of natural speech. By transcribing the talk, the discourse can then be closely analyzed and coded to identify key components and patterns.

The ethnography of speaking approach examines language use in cultural and social contexts. Developed by Dell Hymes, this approach provides tools for analyzing the components of speech events, including setting, participants, ends, acts, keys, instrumentalities, norms, and genre. Using Hymes’ SPEAKING grid, the examples of conversational talk and a political radio interview can be compared in terms of their speech situations, events, and acts.

The conversational talk, for example, may be an informal discussion between two friends in a casual setting. The participants share a close relationship and the end or purpose may be to catch up and strengthen their social bond. The speech acts are casual and lighthearted, and the norms and genre are informal and unstructured. In contrast, the political radio interview involves very different speech events and acts. The setting is formal, the participants are a journalist or host and a political figure, and the end is to inform the audience. The acts involve questioning, responding, critiquing, and advocating a position or policy. The genre follows a structured question-and-answer format with particular turn-taking norms for an interview. 

In summary, the key tools used to analyze these examples of spoken discourse are transcription, coding, and Hymes’ SPEAKING grid. Through a close analysis of the speech events, situation, participants, ends, acts, keys, instrumentalities, norms, and genre, we can understand how discourse aligns with and/or differs from the cultural and social contexts. The ethnography of speaking provides a robust approach to contrasting and comparing conversational talk and political interviews by focusing on the contexts in which talking and speech acts occur.
