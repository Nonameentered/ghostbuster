How do we characterise simplicity and in what ways does simplicity guide a theory to truth?

Simplicity is a key principle that aids in the pursuit of truth and knowledge. Theories, explanations, and ideas that are simple tend to be more plausible, useful and accurate. Simplicity refers to a few related but distinct characteristics. 

First, simplicity implies parsimony or sparseness. A simple theory lacks unnecessary complications, entities or moving parts. It avoids an excess of assumptions, conditions or ad hoc adjustments. All else being equal, a more parsimonious theory is preferable as it is more readily subjected to empirical testing and falsification. The 20th century philosopher Karl Popper argued that falsifiability is a hallmark of a scientific theory. More complex theories with more adjustable parameters can always be tweaked to account for available data, even if the theory is fundamentally flawed. So simplicity aids in the development of falsifiable, verifiable theories.

Simplicity is also reflected in the coherence and elegance of a theory. A simple theory will have an internal logical consistency with broadly applicable principles and concepts that fit together in a seamless, harmonious manner. The equations and models in a simple theory also tend to have an aesthetic symmetry that scientific thinkers often describe as beautiful. While subjective and hard to define, this sense of theoretical beauty reflects an inner coherence of ideas. The 20th century physicist Paul Dirac argued "it is more important to have beauty in one's equations than to have them fit experiment".  While perhaps an overstatement, beauty and inner coherence do point to a simplicity in the logic and construction of an idea.

A further aspect of simplicity is universality. Simple theories tend to apply more broadly, rather than being a special case or limited to a particular domain. They capture fundamental principles that operate across areas. For example, Einstein's theory of general relativity represented a simple and elegant universal theory of gravitation, improving on Newton's more limited theory. Simple theories that apply universally across phenomena are more likely to tap into some essential truth about how the world works.

In all these ways, simplicity acts as a guide towards truth. Theories that are parsimonious, coherent, elegant and apply universally have a greater chance of representing real and important relationships that reflect the actual structure of the world, whether in natural science or beyond. Of course, simplicity is not sufficient - theories must also fit the evidence and be empirically supported. But when evaluating two rival theories that both have evidentiary support, the simpler one should be preferred as the default position in the search for truth. Simplicity thus acts as a guiding principle and inference to the best explanation.

In summary, simplicity is a key attribute that helps theories approximate truth. Simplicity implies parsimony, coherence, elegance and universal applicability - all of which point to theories that may reflect the way the world actually works. While simplicity alone is not enough, it acts as a guiding principle in the scientific pursuit of knowledge and the construction of explanations. When searching for the truth, simplicity can show the way.
