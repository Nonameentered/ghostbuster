Yield management is the practice of controlling inventory and price to maximize revenue for hospitality firms like hotels and airlines. While a necessity for maximizing operational efficiency, yield management is often perceived as unfair by customers when they discover they are paying significantly more or less than other guests for the same room. Price differentiation can generate feelings of unfairness, as customers may believe they deserve equivalent treatment as other guests.  

To improve the perceived fairness of yield management, hotels employ tactics like rate fences and overbooking. Rate fences establish different rates for the same room to limit a customer's ability to compare against lower prices. For example, a hotel may offer lower advance purchase rates versus higher last-minute rates. This obfuscates the price difference and reduces the saliency of unequal prices, improving perceived fairness. Overbooking, the practice of accepting more reservations than actual room capacity, is another method used to maximize revenue. While overbooking does improve yield, it also frequently leads to displaced customers when too many guests show up, damaging satisfaction and fairness perceptions.

A hotel in Edinburgh aiming to enhance its yield management system and prevent customer dissatisfaction should first focus on employing rate fences to conceal unequal pricing from customers. It may offer separate rates for members, advance purchase, last-minute, and package bookings. Clearly communicating the different perks and rules of each rate will portray them as distinct offerings, rather than obviously unequal prices for the same room. The hotel should also overbook rooms conservatively, especially for peak season dates, and determine an optimal overbooking limit based on historical no-show rates. By minimizing displaced customers, especially during Edinburgh's busy summer festival season, the hotel can uphold fairness perceptions even when employing yield management practices.  

With proactive management of rate fences and overbooking limits, the Edinburgh hotel can effectively utilize yield management to maximize revenue while maintaining customer satisfaction. Separating rates into distinct offerings and conservatively overbooking during peak times will generate financial gains without damaging the perceived fairness of prices or service. With strategic yield management optimized for customer experience, the hotel can establish a reputation for providing both value and exceptional service during busy seasons. Overall, careful management of inventory and pricing does not have to lead to dissatisfaction, and hotels practicing yield management fairly and transparently will achieve the most success.
