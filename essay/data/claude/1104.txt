Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging technique that allows for the non-invasive measurement and mapping of biological processes in the body. PET works by detecting pairs of gamma rays emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting radionuclide tracer injected into the body. The tracer emits positrons as it decays, and when the positrons annihilate with electrons in the body, pairs of 511 keV gamma rays are emitted in opposite directions. By detecting these gamma ray pairs, PET is able to construct 3D images that quantitatively show the distribution of the biological process or molecule of interest.  

When the 511 keV gamma rays exit the body, they interact with the PET scanner's detectors which surround the patient. The key interaction is the photoelectric effect, where the gamma ray's energy is absorbed by an electron in the detector material, ejecting the electron in the process. The ejected electron is called a photoelectron, and its kinetic energy is equal to the energy of the gamma ray minus the electron's binding energy. The number of photoelectrons produced depends on the energy of the gamma rays and the atomic number of the detector material. Materials with high atomic numbers like lutetium oxyorthosilicate (LSO) and bismuth germanate (BGO) are often used because they have a higher probability of absorbing the gamma rays.

The PET scanner's detectors detect the photoelectrons and their locations, allowing the system to determine the source and angle of the original gamma rays. By detecting pairs of gamma rays originating from the same positron annihilation event, the scanner is able to localize those events to a line of response.  Multiple such events are used to reconstruct a 3D image of the distribution of the tracer in the body through a process called filtered back projection.

The key to PET is that the radionuclide tracer must be biologically active, such as fluorodeoxyglucose or FDG, which acts like glucose and accumulates in tissues with high metabolism like the brain and tumors. By injecting a patient with FDG and scanning them with PET, physicians can detect areas of abnormal metabolic activity. The amount of tracer uptake depends on multiple factors, including blood flow, membrane transport, and enzyme activityâ€”all of which can be disrupted in disease states. So, PET with FDG allows for the detection and staging of diseases like cancer, as well as monitoring of disease progression and response to treatment.

In summary, positron emission tomography uses radioactive tracers to detect biological processes in the body. Positrons emitted by the tracers annihilate with electrons to produce pairs of 511 keV gamma rays that escape the body. Interactions between the gamma rays and the PET scanner's detectors produce photoelectrons that the scanner uses to localize the gamma ray source. Analysis of the detection data produces 3D images showing the distribution of the tracer, which acts as a proxy for the distribution of the biological process of interest. PET is a powerful tool for detecting and monitoring disease as well as understanding normal bodily functions.
