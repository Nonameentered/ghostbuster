What is sense-data theory and why is it necessary to account for illusion and hallucination? 

Sense-data theory is a philosophical theory about perception that holds that perception gives us direct awareness of mind-dependent objects called sense-data. Sense-data are supposed to be the direct objects of perception and are meant to account for the phenomenal character of experience. They are contrasted with the ordinary objects in the external world that we take ourselves to be perceiving, such as tables, chairs, and trees. 

Sense-data theory was developed primarily to account for the possibility of illusion and hallucination. When we perceive, it's not always clear that we are perceiving the ordinary objects around us. In cases of illusion, it seems we perceive objects that aren't really there, or perceive objects as having properties they lack. For example, a straight stick half immersed in water may appear bent, even though we know it remains straight. In cases of hallucination, we perceive objects that have no external reality at all. Sense-data theory aims to explain these anomalous cases of perception by proposing that what we directly perceive are not external objects themselves but mind-dependent sense-data. Even in illusory or hallucinatory experiences, we perceive sense-data, though there are no corresponding external objects.

Sense-data theory accounts for perception in general by proposing that even in normal, veridical perception, we perceive sense-data, not external objects themselves. The sense-data in normal perceptions are supposed to correspond in an orderly way with external objects and properties, but they remain mind-dependent objects of perception nonetheless. By proposing that sense-data are the direct objects of perception in all cases, sense-data theory offers a unified account of perception that can accommodate illusion, hallucination, and normal perception within the same framework.

There are several difficulties for sense-data theory, however. One concern is that by interposing sense-data between the mind and the external world, the theory seems to raise questions about how exactly sense-data are related to external objects. Sense-data were proposed primarily as a way to account for illusion and hallucination, but they in turn require an account of how sense-data could correspond or fail to correspond to external objects. The theory also struggles to give a satisfactory account of the relation between sense-data and the material brain states and events that underlie perception. If sense-data are truly mind-dependent, it is not clear how they arise from the physical processes occurring in the brain.

In sum, sense-data theory holds that in all perceptual experiences, including illusory and hallucinatory ones, we perceive mind-dependent objects called sense-data. By proposing sense-data as the direct objects of perception, the theory offers an elegant way to give a unified account of perception that can accommodate both veridical and anomalous experiences. However, the theory faces challenges in explaining the relationship between sense-data and the external world they are meant to represent. Sense-data were introduced to address problems with perception, but they give rise to problems of their own. Overall, while sense-data theory aims to provide an intuitive account of the nature of perceptual experience, there are significant difficulties in developing the theory in a fully satisfying way.
