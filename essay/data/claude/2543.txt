The view that the meaning of linguistic expressions can be analyzed wholly in terms of ideas in the mind has been a prevalent one in philosophy. On this view,  the meaning of a word or sentence corresponds to a mental concept or thought  in the mind of the speaker. However, there are some objections to this claim that suggest the view is too simplistic. 

One central objection is that language is a social phenomenon, not just a reflection of individual mental concepts. Words and linguistic conventions are shared between speakers in a community, and the meaning of expressions depends on this shared, public aspect, not just private ideas. For example, to mean addition by “plus,” a speaker must intend to use “plus” in the same way that others in the community do.  If I privately decide that “plus” means subtraction for me, I have failed to grasp the actual meaning that is shared  publicly. So the meaning of “plus” depends on public, social facts, not just my own ideas.

A second objection is that the mentalist view struggles to account for context-dependent meanings and implied meanings. The meaning I intend to convey with an utterance depends greatly on context, shared assumptions, and inferences that go beyond the literal meanings of words. For example, the meaning of “I’m tired” depends on the context and can imply very different things, from a desire to end a conversation to a request for a comforting response from the listener. These implied meanings depend on the context and social relationships, not just private concepts in my own mind.

In response, proponents of the mentalist view could argue that we share linguistic conventions and understand context through a kind of mutual mindreading. We each form mental representations of what others in our linguistic community think, and it is these interlocking mental representations that constitute shared meaning. However, this relies too heavily on assumptions of perfect communication and doesn’t account for the inevitable gaps and mismatches in mutual understanding. 

A better solution may be to recognize that meaning emerges from the interaction of mental representations and the public, social use of language. Our private thoughts shape and are shaped by the conventions of the linguistic communities we inhabit. Meaning is neither solely private nor solely public but arises from the dialectic between internal thought and external expression. By balancing these psychological and social aspects, we can develop a more coherent theory of meaning that avoids the objections to strictly mentalist or strictly conventionalist views.

Overall, while the meanings of our words and sentences are closely tied to the ideas in our minds, meaning is also necessarily a public and social phenomenon that goes beyond private mental representations. A refined view of meaning requires recognizing these multifaceted psychological and social aspects and how they interact. By incorporating insights from both mentalist and conventionalist perspectives, we can arrive at a more compelling philosophical account of linguistic meaning.
