The properties of two metal acetylacetonate complexes, specifically vanadium(IV) bis(acetylacetonate) and manganese(III) tris(acetylacetonate), were investigated in this practical using UV-Vis and IR spectroscopy. These techniques provide insights into the structure and properties of the complexes.

UV-Vis spectroscopy measures the absorption of ultraviolet and visible light by molecules to determine electronic transitions within molecules. For the vanadyl bis(acetylacetonate) complex, UV-Vis spectroscopy revealed an absorption band at 540 nm, corresponding to a d-d electronic transition within the complex. This transition arises from the redistribution of electrons between the d orbitals of the vanadium metal center, which is in the +4 oxidation state. The ability to observe this d-d transition suggests the vanadium ion is in a distorted octahedral coordination environment in this complex. 

IR spectroscopy measures the absorption of infrared light by molecules to determine vibrational transitions and identify functional groups. For both complexes, IR spectroscopy showed characteristic acetylacetonate bands, indicating the presence of acetylacetonate ligands. Additional bands were observed for the vanadyl complex at lower wavenumbers, suggesting the presence of both acetylacetonate and vanadyl groups. The IR spectrum thus also supports the proposed structure of these complexes.

Locating the I and III band peak positions for the manganese tris-acetylacetonate complex in toluene solution proved difficult. The peaks were very weak due to poor solubility of the complex in this solvent, resulting in low concentration. This issue could be addressed by using an alternative solvent in which the complex has higher solubility and thus higher concentration, which would produce stronger absorbance bands that are more readily detected and located. The UV-Vis and IR data obtained for both complexes provide key insights into their structures and properties, especially the significance of the d-d transition observed for the vanadyl bis(acetylacetonate) complex which indicates its distorted octahedral geometry.

In summary, UV-Vis and IR spectroscopy were used to investigate electronic and vibrational transitions of two metal acetylacetonate complexes. The data provide evidence for the proposed structures of these complexes and the oxidation state of the metal centers. Locating weak peaks for the poorly soluble manganese complex was difficult, highlighting the need to consider solubility and concentration effects on spectroscopic measurements.
