There were several key reasons for the growth of popular resistance to British rule in America in the 1760s. First, tensions were rising over increased taxation and parliamentary authority over the colonies. The Navigation Acts and other trade regulations had long rankled colonists, but new taxes like the Sugar Act of 1764 and the Stamp Act of 1765 directly taxed the colonists and led to the rallying cry of "no taxation without representation." Colonists insisted that only their own colonial legislatures could levy taxes on them. 

Second, many colonists adhered to a Radical Whig ideology that opposed tyrannical power and believed in natural rights to life, liberty, and property. The Massachusetts Circular Letter of 1768 articulated these beliefs and helped spread opposition to parliamentary "tyranny." Colonists were increasingly distrustful of British officials and saw their local self-government as key to political liberty. They believed new British taxes and trade regulations after the French and Indian War infringed upon their rights as Englishmen.

Third, the introduction of British troops in Boston in 1768 to enforce customs laws and suppress unrest enraged local citizens and traders. Tensions rose over the next several years until violent confrontations erupted in 1770 (the Boston Massacre) and 1773 (the Boston Tea Party). These events demonstrated the zeal of revolutionary leaders like Samuel Adams and the Sons of Liberty in mobilizing popular protest against symbols of British authority. They showed Britain's limited control over Massachusetts despite attempts to reassert parliamentary power.

In conclusion, by the mid-1760s, Massachusetts and other American colonies had grown increasingly antagonistic toward perceived tyranny from British rule. Radical Whig ideology provided an intellectual foundation for opposing what colonists saw as violations of their rights. Specific policies like new taxes and the Quartering Act further inflamed tensions and resentment of Parliament's involvement in Massachusetts affairs. Frustration bred violence in Boston that would set the stage for the American Revolution in the coming decade. Overall, a mix of ideology and pragmatism fueled popular resistance and a thirst for liberty in Massachusetts that shaped the nascent American spirit of independence in the 1760s.
