A peoples' law tribunal investigating health violations in UNMIK-administered IDP camps that affected Roma communities in Kosovo could adopt the following framework:

1. Establish a panel of independent experts in international law, public health, human rights, and Roma issues to serve as judges. They should have no ties to UNMIK or other parties implicated in the violations. 

2. Allow Roma victims and their advocates to submit evidence and testimony documenting poor living conditions, lack of access to medical care, unsafe water and sanitation, and other violations that caused sickness and even death. UNMIK officials should also be allowed to present evidence in their defense.

3. The tribunal should evaluate if UNMIK failed to meet minimum standards of care required under international law for displaced populations under their administration. They should determine if neglect, discrimination, or other causes led to excess morbidity and mortality, especially among vulnerable groups like Roma children and the elderly.

4. If violations and dereliction of duty are found, the tribunal should issue a report with binding recommendations for UNMIK and other responsible parties to formally acknowledge their failures, issue an apology, and establish a fund to compensate victims and their families.

The political vision inspiring this tribunal is that all people, including marginalized groups like the Roma, deserve equal rights and dignity, especially in times of crisis. The strategy is to use grassroots organization and legal processes to hold international organizations accountable and push them to remedy past injustices even after their mission has ended. By establishing the truth about what happened and acknowledging the harms suffered, a peoples' tribunal can promote reconciliation and help restore trust in institutions meant to protect vulnerable populations like those displaced by war.
