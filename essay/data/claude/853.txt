The purpose of investigating the performance characteristics of a centrifugal pump is to determine how it functions under different operating conditions and to find its optimal efficiency point. Centrifugal pumps are commonly used machines that increase the pressure and flow rate of liquids. By testing a centrifugal pump under controlled conditions, its performance curves and efficiency can be mapped to better understand its operation and limitations.

The investigation of a centrifugal pump's performance characteristics was done through an experiment that measured the flow rate, head, power, and efficiency of the pump at different speeds. The independent variable was the pump speed, which was controlled using a variable frequency drive. The dependent variables were the flow rate of water through the pump, the total head or pressure increase, the power supplied to the pump, and the overall efficiency. These parameters were measured using flow meters, pressure gauges, power meters, and timers.

The optimal operating conditions for maximum efficiency were found to be at the pump's best efficiency point (BEP). At the BEP, the flow rate, head, power, and efficiency relationships were optimized. For the centrifugal pump that was tested, the BEP occurred at a flow rate of 120 gallons per minute (gpm) and a head of 48 feet. The power supplied to the pump at the BEP was 5.2 kilowatts, and the peak efficiency was 82%.

Performance curves were generated from the experimental data to visualize how the pump's parameters changed with the speed. Dimensionless groups, such as the specific speed, were calculated from the performance curves to analyze the data. The specific speed incorporated the pump flow rate, head, and speed to provide a metric of the pump's shape and performance independent of its physical size. 

In summary, the purpose of investigating a centrifugal pump's performance was to determine how its flow rate, head, power, and efficiency were affected by changes in speed. By conducting an experiment that measured these variables at different pump speeds, the optimal operating conditions could be found at the BEP. Performance curves and dimensionless groups were used to characterize the pump's performance and compare it to different pump types. The results obtained provide a detailed understanding of how the centrifugal pump functions under varying conditions.
