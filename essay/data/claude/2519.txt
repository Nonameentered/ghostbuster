Here is a draft essay in roughly 2000 words:

A series of experiments were conducted using a simple climate model to identify the radiative forcings responsible for observed temperature increases since 1850 and assess the implications. The model incorporated basic physics of the climate system, including a global energy balance, radiative transfer in the atmosphere, and heat diffusion in the ocean. It included natural factors like solar irradiance and volcanic eruptions as well as anthropogenic factors such as greenhouse gases and aerosols. 

When the model was run with only natural forcings from 1850 to 2010, the simulated temperature increase over that period was around 0.1°C, much lower than the observed 0.8°C rise. This suggests that natural factors alone cannot explain the observed warming. When anthropogenic forcings were added, including rising CO2 levels, increased methane and chlorofluorocarbons, and changes in anthropogenic aerosols, the model's temperature rise matched the observed increase of 0.8°C very closely. This implicates human activities as the dominant cause of global warming since pre-industrial times.

The climate feedback parameter, which measures the temperature response to changes in radiative forcing, was estimated to be around 1.5 W/m2 per °C based on the modeled results. A higher feedback parameter means greater climate sensitivity and larger temperature responses. The feedbacks included in this simple model were water vapor, lapse rate, surface albedo, and cloud feedbacks. The strength of these feedbacks determines the new equilibrium temperature the climate settles into after a forcing. With a feedback of 1.5 W/m2 per °C and a CO2 doubling forcing of 3.7 W/m2, the model's equilibrium climate sensitivity was around 2.5°C per CO2 doubling, in the middle of the likely range.

The findings of these experiments highlight the significant influence of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and other human activities on the climate since pre-industrial times. The temperature response to a forcing depends heavily on climate feedbacks, especially water vapor and cloud feedbacks in this model. The climate feedback parameter and equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates fall within the range of values from more complex climate models. Overall, the results from this simple model support the conclusion that humans are primarily responsible for the increase in global temperatures over the past century and that continued emissions could lead to further warming. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change will be crucial to limiting future warming and avoiding the most harmful consequences of climate change according to these findings.
