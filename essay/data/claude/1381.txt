Here is a draft 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Should non-state commercial codifications be recognized as a possible option for choice of law rules in commercial contracts, or should they continue to be excluded in favor of state laws? There are arguments on both sides of this issue.

On the one hand, parties to a commercial contract should have a high degree of autonomy to choose the rules that govern their transaction. Allowing contracting parties to choose non-state commercial codes like the Uniform Commercial Code or UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts provides flexibility and enables the parties to select rules specifically tailored to commercial transactions. These codified rules also provide clarity and predictability regarding default terms that the parties have not specified. 

However, there are some limitations to party autonomy in choice of law. First, parties cannot choose law that would violate public policy. Allowing choice of non-state commercial law could enable parties to evade important public policy priorities enshrined in state law like consumer protections or labor rights. States have an interest in protecting public policy concerns for transactions connected to their territory. Second, non-state commercial codifications may be ambiguous or difficult to interpret, especially if they have not been tested in courts. Without a developed jurisprudence, parties may face uncertainty in how these non-state laws would apply to their situation.

States also have an interest in maintaining their authoritative position as the sole entities that can make and interpret law. Allowing non-state norms to govern commercial transactions, even if chosen by the parties, infringes on this authority. States have an incentive to protect their monopoly on making and interpreting law. If non-state commercial codifications were recognized as valid choice of law options, it could undermine the power and role of state law.

In conclusion, while party autonomy and the benefits of tailored commercial rules suggest non-state commercial codifications could be options for choice of law, there are also significant limitations including public policy concerns, lack of developed interpretation of these non-state laws, and the infringement on state authority. On balance, state law is a safer choice of law option in order to protect key state interests, uphold the rule of law, and benefit from more developed jurisprudence. For these reasons, non-state commercial codifications should continue to be excluded in favor of state law. Overall this essay lays out the key arguments on both sides of this issue but ultimately comes down in favor of upholding the exclusive authority of state law.
