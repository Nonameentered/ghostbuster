The objective of an experiment using a strain gauge is to measure the small changes in length of an object under stress. A strain gauge consists of a long, thin resistive wire attached to a surface. As the surface deforms, the wire also deforms, altering its resistivity. By measuring this change in resistivity, the strain on the object can be determined. 

Measurement sensitivity is critical for strain gauge experiments. The change in resistance due to applied stress may be very small, so high-sensitivity wiring and instrumentation are required to detect it. Factors like wire length, cross-sectional area, and material all affect the sensitivity. Longer, thinner wires of a material with high gauge factor, like copper-nickel alloy, provide the highest sensitivity.  

The Wheatstone bridge circuit uses four resistors to create a balanced condition where the voltage across the bridge is zero. Two resistors have fixed values, while the other two vary with applied strain. When the bridge is balanced, the ratio of resistances of the variable arms equals the ratio of the fixed arms. As strain is applied and the resistances of the variable arms change, the bridge becomes unbalanced, and an output voltage is produced that can be correlated to the amount of strain.

The output voltage of the system depends on how much the applied force changes the resistance of the strain gauges. There is a linear relationship between the change in resistance and the applied force. The system can be calibrated by applying known loads and measuring the output voltage. Within the linear range, the output voltage is directly proportional to the applied load.  

To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, several techniques can be used. Proper shielding and grounding helps reduce electromagnetic interference. The bridge circuit can be powered by a stable DC source to minimize noise. Amplifying the output signal and filtering it with a low-pass filter removes high-frequency noise components. Increasing gauge sensitivity also improves the signal-to-noise ratio by producing a larger output signal.

The sensitivity of a force sensor refers to the smallest change in force it can resolve. it depends on gauge factor, number of active gauge elements, Wheatstone bridge configuration, and signal conditioning electronics. Higher gauge factor, more gauges, full-bridge configuration, and low-noise electronics all help to improve sensitivity.
