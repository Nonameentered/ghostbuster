Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) are conducted to assess the potential environmental impacts of a proposed project such as a new industrial facility, road, or commercial development. An important first step in the EIA process is scoping. Scoping refers to the process of determining the scope of the EIA, including identifying which impacts will be studied in detail and which ones can be excluded from further assessment. Scoping is designed to focus the EIA on the most significant issues and impacts.  

Scoping typically begins once an organization proposes a new project that triggers an EIA. The scoping process involves consulting with stakeholders like government agencies, non-profit organizations, academic institutions, and members of the public who may be affected by or interested in the project. Through meetings, comments, and discussions, the key environmental impacts of concern are identified. These may include impacts on air and water quality, traffic, wildlife habitat, cultural artifacts, or other issues depending on the nature of the project and location.

A variety of methods are used to facilitate the scoping process and identify potentially significant impacts. Public meetings, open houses, and stakeholder workshops are commonly used to solicit input from interested parties. Web-based commenting and surveys are also employed. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can be used to overlay project details on maps of the surrounding area to identify where key environmental features, resources, and receptors may be affected. Checklists, impact matrices, and expert judgment are also used to systematically evaluate possible impacts. 

Throughout the scoping process, the input received is reviewed to determine which potential impacts warrant detailed assessment in the EIA, based on factors such as the importance or sensitivity of the resources affected, extent and duration of effects, public concern, and consistency with laws and policies. Impacts found to not be significant do not receive further study in the EIA, allowing for resources to be focused on the most pressing issues.

Scoping is a useful process not only for identifying significant impacts to assess but also for informing and including the public and other interested parties. Discussing the proposed project, answering questions, and addressing concerns at an early stage can help to avoid misunderstandings or conflict later. Informing stakeholders about which impacts will—and will not—be studied in detail also helps to set proper expectations for the scope and content of the final EIA report. Overall, a well-conducted scoping process results in an EIA that is focused, transparent, inclusive of public input, and more likely to adequately address the environmental issues of real significance or concern.
