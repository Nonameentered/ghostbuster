The objective of the experiment was to evaluate the power generation characteristics of a small wind turbine at varying wind speeds and electrical load conditions. Specifically, the experiment aimed to determine the cut-in speed, rated speed, cut-out speed, and maximum power output of the wind turbine. The cut-in speed is the minimum wind speed required for the turbine to start generating power. The rated speed is the wind speed at which the turbine achieves its maximum power output. The cut-out speed is the maximum wind speed at which the turbine can safely operate before it needs to shut down to avoid damage.

To conduct the experiment, the small wind turbine was installed at an open site with minimal wind obstructions to ensure consistent wind flow. The turbine specifications indicate it has a rotor diameter of 5 meters, a height of 15 meters, and a rated power of 10 kilowatts at a wind speed of 12 meters per second. The experiment was conducted by connecting the turbine to a load bank to simulate connecting it to an electricity grid. The load bank allowed varying the electrical load on the turbine to determine its power output at different loads.

Anemometers were installed at the same height as the wind turbine to accurately measure the wind speed during the experiment. The anemometers were placed in an arc at different angles around the wind turbine to account for any variability in wind speed in different directions. The anemometers were connected to a data acquisition system to continuously log the wind speed measurements during the experiment. The power output of the wind turbine and the load settings on the load bank were also connected to the data acquisition system to log power measurements. 

The experiment was conducted by setting the load bank to different loads from 10 to 100% of the rated capacity of the turbine at 10% intervals. At each load setting, the wind speed was slowly increased in 1 meter per second increments, and the power output of the turbine was measured by the data acquisition system. This process was repeated until the cut-out speed of the turbine was reached at each load level.

In summary, the objectives of characterizing the cut-in speed, rated speed, cut-out speed, and maximum power output of the small wind turbine were achieved through a methodical experiment using anemometers, a load bank, and a data acquisition system to measure the wind speed, electrical load, and power output of the turbine. The results were then analyzed to determine the power generation characteristics of the wind turbine.
