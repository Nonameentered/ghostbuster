Plutarch's version of the Osiris myth, as discussed in his On Isis and Osiris, is both a useful and problematic tool for the study of Egyptian mythology. On the one hand, Plutarch's text provides one of the most comprehensive accounts of the ancient Egyptian myth of Osiris, as it was understood by educated Greeks and Romans of the Roman-era. Plutarch also incorporates information he gathered from Egyptian priests, and so his work may preserve some aspects of the myth that were fading from Egyptian records. However, Plutarch provides an outsider's interpretation of the myth, shaped by his own cultural assumptions and philosophical interests. His version inevitably differs in key ways from canonical Egyptian sources. While it can be a useful source of information, Plutarch's account must be used cautiously and compared rigorously with primary Egyptian evidence. 

Some of the key differences between Plutarch and Egyptian sources relate to the focus and framing of the myth. In Egyptian sources, the Osiris myth is centrally focused on the god Osiris, his death at the hands of his brother Set, his resurrection by his wife Isis, and his role as king of the underworld and judge of the dead. The myth helps explain the origin of rituals related to death and funerary practices. In Plutarch, the focus shifts to provide a broader cosmic and allegorical meaning. Osiris is a symbol for the orderly, civilized world and moral law. Set represents violence, barbarism, and excessive desire. The conflict between them is a symbolic struggle between good and evil. Plutarch is more interested in the symbolic and philosophical meaning of the myth than the cultic practices associated with Osiris.

Plutarch provides details that align with Egyptian sources, suggesting he had access to authentic information from Egyptian priests. For example, he accurately describes Osiris as a wise and benevolent ruler who traveled the world spreading civilization, before being trapped in a decorated coffer by Set and thrown into the Nile. He also recounts how Isis finds Osiris' remains, which have been scattered across Egypt, and works to revive him, leading to their eventual union as king and queen of the underworld. However, Plutarch differs in his account of Osiris' death. In Egyptian sources, Osiris is drowned in the Nile in his coffer. Plutarch claims that Set dismembers Osiris' corpse and scatters the pieces across Egypt. The dismemberment of Osiris does not appear in surviving Egyptian sources and seems to have been Plutarch's own adaptation or misunderstanding.

Plutarch's philosophical interests also lead him to develop ideas not found in Egyptian mythology. He portrays the myth of Osiris and Isis as an allegory for profound metaphysical and ethical truths. For example, he equates Osiris with the orderly cosmos and the moral law of justice. Set represents disorder, excess, greed and wickedness. Their conflict is a symbolic archetype for the struggle between good and evil in the universe.   Plutarch sees in their story allegories of the moon's monthly cycles, the inundation of the Nile, and fertility. These metaphysical interpretations reflect Plutarch's Middle Platonist philosophy, not ancient Egyptian theology. 

In conclusion, while Plutarch's version of the Osiris myth provides a relatively comprehensive narrative of the story and some useful details that align with Egyptian sources, scholars must use it cautiously. Plutarch's account is shaped by his own cultural assumptions and philosophical interests, which lead him to significantly reinterpret and adapt the myth to fit a different symbolic and allegorical understanding than is found in genuine Egyptian theology. To reconstruct the beliefs and rituals of the ancient Egyptians as accurately as possible, Plutarch's text must be analyzed critically and compared systematically with Egyptian sources. Used judiciously, it can provide a helpful complement to scarce Egyptian evidence, but should not be treated as an unfiltered representation of Egyptian mythology. Overall, Plutarch's account is both a useful resource and potentially misleading influence, depending on how rigorously and critically it is analyzed.
