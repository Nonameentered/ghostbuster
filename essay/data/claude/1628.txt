The poem "The First Men on Mercury" by Edwin Morgan explores themes of communication and difficulty of living together through its depiction of the challenging dynamics between two astronauts on the planet Mercury. Morgan's original poem adopts a rather detached and observational stance, impartially portraying the growing tension and conflict between the astronauts. In contrast, a rewritten version of the poem could provide a different perspective by focalizing the story through the inner thoughts and experiences of one of the astronauts. 

Adopting the close third-person perspective of one character allows readers to gain deeper insights into the complex emotions and psychological struggles involved in the breakdown of the relationship and communication between the astronauts. We can experience first-hand the initial optimism and camaraderie between the astronauts in the opening lines of the poem as they work "elbow to elbow" in harmony. However, seeds of discord are already being sown as "little things begin to jar" due to their differences in background and temperament.

 Tensions start to build up and "fester" as misunderstandings crop up from ambiguous or brusque communication. The claustrophobic and isolated setting of Mercury, with its "starry dome" over their heads serving as a metaphor for the inescapability of their situation, exacerbates the friction and conflict between them. The astronaut's narrative perspective also allows us to empathize with his growing anguish, frustration and even despair at the deterioration of the relationship. We can share in his futile attempts to repair the broken communication and connection, as well as gain insight into how he wrestles internally with his own prejudices and imperfections.

Overall, the poem retains major threads in depicting the communication breakdown between the astronauts and the immense challenges of living closely together in an alienating setting. However, the use of the close third-person perspective provides a more intimate angle into the emotional journeys of the characters. We are able to grasp the deeper human complexities behind the superficial conflicts and understand how fragile relationships can be without openness, empathy and understanding. By focalizing the story through one character's perspective, the rewritten poem thus offers a more profound reflection on the themes of communication and co-habitation.
