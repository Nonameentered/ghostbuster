How Medical Schools Can Better Prepare Students to Discuss Death and Dying 

Medical school curricula focus primarily on teaching students the scientific knowledge and technical skills required to diagnose and treat patients. However, communicating with patients and their families about difficult topics like death and dying is an equally important skill for physicians to develop. Medical schools can better prepare students in several ways.

First, medical schools should require courses or training specifically focused on end-of-life communication and palliative care. Discussing a terminal prognosis or options for comfort care at the end of life can be an emotionally fraught experience for physicians and patients alike. Requiring all students to learn about approaches to these sensitive conversations, as well as the practical and ethical considerations around palliative care, will help ensure all future physicians feel competent in this area. Some schools have created elective courses, but requiring this training will guarantee students are exposed to this critical topic.

Second, medical schools should integrate end-of-life communication skills into the curriculum for each specialty. The specific conversations physicians have with patients differ between specialties, so training should be tailored for each context. For oncologists, discussions about halting chemotherapy and transitioning to hospice care are common and require nuanced communication. For cardiologists, conversations about defibrillators, CPR, and advanced directives are more relevant. Specialty-specific coursework and opportunities for role-playing different scenarios will prepare students for the situations they will face.

Third, students should have more opportunities to observe experienced physicians conducting end-of-life conversations. Watching master clinicians role model how to break bad news, discuss prognosis, and make recommendations with empathy and compassion gives students an exemplar to emulate. They can see how more senior physicians navigate challenging questions or emotionally fraught discussions in real time. Shadowing physicians should be a required part of end-of-life communication training.

Finally, medical schools should encourage open conversations about death and dying throughout the curriculum. Discussing mortality should not just be confined to a few lectures or role-playing exercises. Regular conversations about death and dying throughout ethics courses, patient case discussions, and rotations help normalize these topics and break down barriers. Students will feel more at ease discussing end-of-life issues with patients if they have grappled with these topics throughout their training.

In summary, medical schools must make end-of-life communication and palliative care education a higher priority in their curriculum to adequately prepare students for these difficult but important conversations. Requiring specialized courses, integrating communication training into specialty curricula, providing opportunities to observe master clinicians, and promoting open conversations about death and dying throughout the curriculum are all ways medical schools can better support students in achieving competence and comfort in this vital area. Equipping future physicians with these skills will enable them to provide the best possible care for patients and families during the end of life.
