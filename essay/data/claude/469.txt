C.A. Bayly and Jack Goldstone have offered influential accounts of the crises of empire that eastern polities faced starting in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. While their arguments share some similarities in identifying the impact of catastrophic ecological, fiscal and political pressures in shaping the course of these crises, they differ significantly in their overarching approaches to studying the issues, analyses of causal factors, perspectives on the key dimensions of these crises, and evaluations of their consequences.

Bayly adopts a broad comparative approach across societies and over time to study the “birth of the modern world” from 1780 to 1914. Within this, he studies the interlinked crises of empire in Ottoman Turkey, the Qing dynasty of China, and Mughal India. His key argument is that these were systemic crises linked to the increasing political, economic and intellectual connections between polities globally in this period. In contrast, Goldstone takes a more focused look at the crisis of the Qing dynasty starting in the 19th century, tracing its roots to the fiscal crisis caused by explosive population growth in the preceding century and the resulting ecological crises and state breakdown. While his analysis focuses on just one case, his arguments are meant to apply more broadly to peasant-based agrarian societies facing shocks.

In terms of causal factors, Bayly emphasizes the role of globalizing influences—the impact of wars and diplomacy with Western powers and of Western political ideals and military technology in weakening empires in the east. In comparison, Goldstone highlights endogenous factors within China—the unsustainability of accelerating population growth, land degradation and state finances—and sees Western contact more as an exacerbating influence. For Goldstone, the crisis was fundamentally caused by the contradictory dynamics of agricultural society and political rationality in China, with social unrest, fiscal decline and state breakdown as its key markers. In contrast, Bayly views the crises more through a geopolitical lens, emphasizing military defeats, the erosion of political authority and territorial losses to Western powers as indicators of decline.

The dimensions of crisis they highlight also differ significantly. For Bayly, it was a multi-dimensional crisis of the imperial state, economy and legitimacy. Goldstone, in contrast, focuses almost exclusively on the state fiscal crisis and related political collapse in China. Goldstone sees the crisis through the lens of a standard political-demographic cycle, in which population growth outstrips agricultural production, causing taxation, and state fiscal crises. Bayly has a more varied perspective, emphasizing diverse global-local linkages. Similarly, while Goldstone focuses on political dynamics within China, Bayly puts more emphasis on geopolitical and global factors. Finally, their evaluations of the consequences diverge. Goldstone sees the crisis as marking “the end of the dynastic cycle” in China, with catastrophic collapse. Bayly sees the crises more as transitions to new forms of state and empire responding to global change, with more continuity as well as breakdown.

In conclusion, while Bayly and Goldstone share some broad perspectives on the instabilities facing eastern empires, their accounts differ considerably in approach, analysis of causes, view of dimensions, and understanding consequences. Goldstone adopts a more geographically and causally focused analysis of the singular crisis in Qing China. In contrast, Bayly takes a wider view of interconnected global crises in the long 19th century and a more multifactor perspective on their emergence. Both, however, make valuable contributions to our understanding of how empire was transformed in this critical period.
