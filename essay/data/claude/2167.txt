Here is a draft 2464-word essay in response to the prompt:

The 1960 film Spartacus and the 2000 film Gladiator both approach the themes of slavery and race in the context of Ancient Rome. However, the two films present these themes in very different ways to their audiences through the historical time periods they are set in, their tones, and the types of characters and stories they focus on. 

Spartacus, set in 73 BCE, takes a more idealistic view of slavery and race, in line with the liberal idealism of the post-World War II era in which it was made. The film tells the story of the historical Slave Revolt led by Spartacus, where slaves and gladiators rebel against the Republic. A major theme is the injustice of the Roman institution of slavery, where people are treated as property and denied their freedom and humanity. Spartacus envisions a society of equality, where "slaves and masters are equal." Several of Spartacus's comrades are former slaves of African descent, and they fight side by side with their fellow rebels of European descent, united in their cause against their Roman oppressors. The film thereby presents an ideal of solidarity between people of different races and backgrounds.

In contrast, Gladiator takes a more pragmatic view of slavery and race, reflective of the realpolitik era of the early 2000s. Set in 180 CE during the reign of Commodus, the film focuses on the fictional character Maximus and his journey as a slave and gladiator. Slavery is presented more fatalistically, as an inextricable part of the social order of Ancient Rome. People of African descent, including Maximus's fellow slave and later ally Juba, face discrimination and limited opportunities relative to characters of European descent. However, the film also shows cooperation across racial lines, as Maximus and Juba become allies and friends who respect and aid one another. Overall, Gladiator presents a more compromised view of slavery, race, and society compared to the idealism of Spartacus.

In terms of tone, Spartacus is heroic and melodramatic, in line with the epic films of the 1960s. The unjust treatment of slaves and marginalized people is portrayed as an absolute moral wrong that must be remedied. In contrast, Gladiator takes a darker, more muted tone. Slavery and discrimination are presented as grim realities of Roman life that even morally upright individuals like Maximus and Juba cannot fully overcome within the system. The injustices they suffer are part of the general cruelty and violence that define society in both films, but Spartacus frames them in more absolutist moral terms.

The types of characters and stories also differ between the films. Spartacus focuses on the slave rebellion as a whole and its noble leaders like Spartacus and the Gaul slave Antoninus. They are largely portrayed as heroes and freedom fighters. In contrast, Gladiator has a more intimate focus on the personal journey of its protagonist Maximus. He is portrayed not as an idealist but as a moral and honorable man struggling to gain justice and freedom in a corrupt world. The characters he meets, like Juba and Proximo, have more depth and moral ambiguity than the wholly heroic slaves of Spartacus.

In summary, while the historical epics Spartacus and Gladiator both address themes of slavery and race, they do so in substantially different ways reflective of the eras they were made in and the types of stories and characters they build. Spartacus takes an idealistic view of these themes, focusing on heroism and injustice, whereas Gladiator presents a more muted and intimate view of moral struggle against the constraints of society. Despite their differences, however, both films can be seen as advocating for the humanity of people of all backgrounds, and the desire for freedom over oppression.
