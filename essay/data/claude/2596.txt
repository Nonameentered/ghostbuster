Here is a draft 1500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Plato's Theory of Forms argues that the material world is imperfect and ever-changing, while the world of ideas or Forms is perfect and unchanging. The main argument for the existence of Plato's Forms is his doctrine of recollection which posits that we are born with knowledge of the Forms which are then "recollected" through our senses.

Plato developed the Theory of Forms to resolve some tensions in the teachings of his mentor Socrates. Socrates believed that philosophy should pursue definitions of abstract concepts such as justice, virtue, and equality. However, he was unable to identify fixed definitions, as concrete examples of these concepts seemed to constantly change and differ. Plato's Theory of Forms is an attempt to resolve this paradox. 

Plato argued that abstract concepts have an ultimate, fixed reality as Forms which exist in a transcendent realm separate from the physical world. The Forms represent perfection and pure being. They are eternal, unchanging, and more "real" than the objects of the physical world. The objects and qualities we encounter in the physical world are dim reflections of the ultimate reality of the Forms. For example, all circles we draw or observe are imperfect representations of the perfect Form of "circle." All acts of justice or goodness are weak imitations of the perfect Forms of "justice" and "the Good." The material world is fleeting, imperfect, and a "shadow world." Only the world of the Forms can be the source of truth and knowledge.

Plato's main argument for the existence of Forms is his theory of recollection. In his dialogue Meno, Plato suggests that "learning is recollection." We are born with knowledge of the transcendent Forms, but we forget this perfect knowledge at birth. As we experience the physical world, we "recollect" our knowledge of the Forms. Sensory perceptions serve as triggers to help us remember the truth we already know. For example, seeing a circle drawn in the sand reminds us of the perfect Form of "circle."  

The theory of recollection suggests that truth and knowledge are possible. We can come to know the ultimate reality represented in the Forms through philosophy and reason, not just senses. The theory also gives the Forms a kind of primacy as we must be born with innate knowledge of them prior to any sensory experience. They are not derived from the physical world, rather the opposite. They are eternal, transcendent realities which we come to recollect.

In conclusion, Plato's Theory of Forms suggests the existence of two worlds: the physical world of objects, which is imperfect and changing, and the transcendent world of Forms, which is perfect and eternal. The main argument for the existence of the Forms is Plato's theory of recollection, which posits that we are born with innate knowledge of the Forms which our senses then help us to recollect. The Theory of Forms resolves the tension between philosophy's search for absolute truth and the imperfect and changing nature of the material world.
