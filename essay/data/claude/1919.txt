Here is a 505 word essay in response to the prompt:

It is necessary to dry the surface of agar plates before streaking to prevent the excess moisture on the agar surface from diluting and spreading out the inoculum as it is streaked. The inoculum needs to be localized to distinct areas of the plate in order to obtain isolated colonies. If the surface is wet, the inoculum will diffuse into the moisture and spread widely across the plate, preventing isolation of distinct colonies.  

Agar plates are incubated inverted to prevent excess moisture from collecting on the agar surface. As the microbes grow, they release moisture. If the plates were incubated upright, this moisture would pool on the surface, again causing diffusion of the colonies into each other. By incubating inverted, the excess moisture flows down the sides of the agar, maintaining a drier surface and allowing isolated colony growth.

The streaking method, known as the quadrant streaking method, involves inoculating the plate with the sample by streaking it onto one section of the plate and then using a new sterile loop to streak from that section into a new section. This is repeated until the plate has been streaked into 4 separate sections. This method allows for dilution of the sample and separation of individual cells far enough apart that distinct colonies will form as the cells multiply. The first streak will contain many colonies, but as the streaking progresses, fewer colonies will form further away from the original inoculum. This results in isolated colonies in the last streaked quadrant.

Typical individual colonies are usually circular in shape, with entire margins, a slightly raised profile, and a smooth glistening surface. Colonies of bacteria may differ in size, color, elevation, and pigment production depending on the specific type of bacteria. Mould colonies, on the other hand, growing in a liquid medium are usually irregular in shape with a woolly, filamentous texture from the growth of hyphae in the medium. The colony appears suspended within the medium, rather than growing on the surface. 

In summary, proper preparation of agar plates, including drying the surface and inverting the incubated plates, is necessary to achieve the isolated colony growth that is useful for studying microscopic organisms. The quadrant streaking method introduces serial dilution of the sample to accomplish this isolation of colonies. Careful observation of colony morphology provides further information about the organisms grown.
