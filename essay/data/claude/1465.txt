Here is a draft 2750-word essay in response to the prompt:

In Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a prevailing concept is madness and the way society constructs ideas of normality and deviance. The story is set in a mental institution, where individuals who deviate from established social norms are labeled as "mad" and subjected to institutional control. A central theme of the novel is subjugation versus individual liberation, as the protagonist Randle McMurphy challenges the authoritarian rule of Nurse Ratched over the ward. 

Nurse Ratched represents the oppressive forces of social control that impose conformity and subjugate individual identity. She maintains strict discipline over the patients' daily schedule, suppresses any dissent or deviance, and strips the men of their independence and dignity. The fog machine is a metaphor for the way Ratched clouds and obscures independent thinking. Under her rule, the men have become weak, emasculated, and unable to think for themselves. They have internalized her control and oppressive voice.

McMurphy poses a threat to Ratched's authority because he refuses to be subjugated and challenges the status quo. He openly mocks Ratched's rules, encourages the other patients to question her control, and revives their sense of self and masculinity. His laughter and free spirit are contagious, giving the men a sense of strength, joy, and liberation. McMurphy's deviance and rule-breaking are a form of protest against the oppression of individuality. While Ratched sees him as "mad" for refusing to conform, McMurphy is actually saner than the institution that has pathologized free thought.

A key theme is the way society constructs "madness" and uses it to control and subjugate. The novel suggests that the real madness lies in the oppressive machinery of institutions like the Combine. The patients have been labeled as deviant for expressing their individuality, and then pathologized for the way they have been conditioned to conform. The novel ultimately shows how the human spirit will always resist complete subjugation, as the men unite to overcome Ratched's control. Though the system crushes McMurphy in the end, his laughter and spirit of rebellion live on as an inspiration.   

In conclusion, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest explores how the concept of madness is constructed to enforce conformity and how individuals can fight against oppressive control. McMurphy represents a liberating deviance and independent spirit that awakens others and gives them strength. Though crushed by the authoritarian system he defies, his resistance and the way he stirs humanity in others show how the will to be free and individual can never be completely subjugated. The novel is a compelling criticism of institutional control over the human mind and a testament to the power of the individual.
