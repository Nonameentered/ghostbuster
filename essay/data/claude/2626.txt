What Can Studying Neanderthal Anatomy Reveal About Their Behavior and Lifestyle?

Neanderthals were our closest extinct human relatives, inhabiting Europe and Western Asia before disappearing around 40,000 years ago. Although Neanderthals were physiologically very similar to modern humans, they exhibited some distinct anatomical features that provide insights into their behavior and lifestyle. By examining Neanderthal anatomy, we can infer details about how they may have lived, hunted, socialized, and evolved over thousands of years. 

One of the most distinguishing features of Neanderthals was their robust, muscular build. Neanderthal skeletons show that they had larger bodies, thicker bones, and more muscle mass than contemporary humans. This strong, sturdy body type suggests that Neanderthals likely engaged in demanding physical tasks, such as hunting large prey or working with tools. Their greater muscle mass, especially in the arms and torso, indicates they often performed strenuous lifting and dragging activities. Such physical traits would have been advantageous for their survival in the harsh, cold climates of Ice Age Europe.

Neanderthals also had distinctive features in their hands, wrists, and shoulders that point to regular tool use and hunting behaviors. Their fingers were short, robust, and lacked the fine precision and manipulation of modern human hands. However, their thumbs were longer and more dexterous, enabling a firm grip useful for grasping spears and tools. Neanderthals also often suffered from " osteoarthritis" in their shoulders, elbows, and other joints, which resulted from frequent overhead reaching and thrusting motions, such as those used in spear hunting. Tool cut marks have also been found on Neanderthal bones, showing direct evidence of the use of sharp implements, likely for activities like butchering animals or preparing hides.

The Neanderthal skull and face also exhibited unique characteristics, with a protruding midface, low, sloping forehead, and large nasal cavity. The prominent brow ridges and lack of a protruding chin gave Neanderthals a distinctive profile. Their larger noses, while enabling greater heat exchange, also suggest that smell may have played an important role in Neanderthal life, perhaps in close-quarters social interaction or hunting. The Neanderthal brain, while large, was generally elongated with a shorter frontal lobe compared to humans. This shape may have impacted their capacity  for abstract thought, long-term planning, and social relationships.

In summary, the anatomical features of Neanderthals provide a glimpse into how they lived, evolved, and eventually went extinct. Their robust and muscular build shows they performed physically demanding tasks, likely hunting and tool use. Features of their hands, shoulders, and skeletons point to frequent tool handling, while their unique skulls and brains suggest how they may have sensed and interacted with the world differently than modern humans. By examining the Neanderthal anatomy, we gain insights into the challenging lives of our closest ancient human relatives. Overall, their anatomical evolution and adaptation over thousands of years eventually proved insufficient in the face of competition from anatomically modern humans, leading to their disappearance. But studying their anatomy helps ensure that Neanderthals are not forgotten.
