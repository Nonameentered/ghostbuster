Here is a 980 word essay in response to the prompt:

DNA and RNA are two similar yet distinct nucleic acids found in cells. While they are both polymers composed of nucleotide units, there are some key differences that allow them to be distinguished from each other. Several experimental methods can be used to differentiate DNA from RNA. 

The most straightforward method is to examine the base composition of the nucleic acid. DNA contains the bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. RNA contains adenine, guanine, and cytosine, but has uracil instead of thymine. By analyzing the base content using techniques like chromatography, one can determine if the sample contains thymine or uracil and thereby identify if it is DNA or RNA.

Another key difference is that RNA molecules contain the sugar ribose, while DNA molecules contain the sugar deoxyribose. The ribose sugar in RNA has one more hydroxyl group than the deoxyribose in DNA. Chemical analysis of the sugars, for example using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, can be used to distinguish ribose from deoxyribose and thus RNA from DNA.

RNA also tends to be single-stranded, while DNA is typically double-stranded. Techniques like UV spectroscopy can be used to assess if a nucleic acid sample is single or double stranded by examining its UV absorption. Single-stranded RNA will have a higher UV absorbance at 260 nm compared to the same concentration of double-stranded DNA.

Enzymatic digestion is also useful for differentiating DNA and RNA. RNase, or ribonuclease enzymes, specifically degrade single-stranded RNA molecules. Exposure of a nucleic acid sample to RNase will result in degradation of any RNA present. Resistance to RNase indicates the sample likely contains DNA. DNase, or DNA-specific nucleases, can then be used to confirm the presence of DNA if needed. 

An experiment to demonstrate how these techniques can identify unknown nucleic acid samples could go as follows: 

Unknown samples of DNA, RNA, and a mixture of DNA and RNA are obtained. Chromatography is first used to analyze the base composition of each sample. The presence of thymine would indicate DNA, while uracil would indicate RNA. 

UV spectroscopy is then employed to assess if any of the samples are single or double stranded. A higher 260 nm absorbance would suggest single-stranded RNA.

Each sample is then treated with RNase. Any degradation of a sample when exposed to RNase signifies it contained RNA. Resistance to RNase indicates the sample may be DNA.

Finally, DNase can be used to verify the presence of DNA in any samples that were resistant to RNase. Sensitivity to DNase confirms the sample is DNA.

In summary, through a combination of base composition analysis, sugar analysis, single vs. double strand assessment, and targeted enzymatic digestion using RNases and DNases, unknown nucleic acid samples can be reliably identified as either DNA or RNA or a mixture of both. Care must be taken to avoid RNase contamination which can lead to false conclusions if it degrades RNA in the samples unintentionally. Proper handling and experimental technique helps ensure high quality, reproducible results.
