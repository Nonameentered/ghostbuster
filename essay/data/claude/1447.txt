"Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway and Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier both explore the theme of gender  roles through their characters in different ways. Woolf uses Clarissa Dalloway's internal monologue to show how restrictive and inescapable traditional feminine gender roles were for upper-class women in post-World War I England. Ford offers a more complex view of gender roles through his main characters, Dowell and Florence.

Clarissa Dalloway embodies the social expectations placed on women of her time and class. She is first and foremost defined by her relationships to the men in her life - as a wife and later as a potential lover to Peter Walsh. Her sense of purpose comes from performing duties like giving parties and managing the household. Her internal thoughts show her chafing at and questioning these limited roles at times, indicating Woolf's view that they were overly restrictive. However, Clarissa ultimately accepts them as inescapable. Woolf suggests feminine gender roles constrained women's independence and identity.

In contrast, Ford's depiction of gender roles is more ambiguous through the characters of Dowell and Florence. Dowell's passivity and acceptance of whatever is told to him by the deceitful Florence and Edward suggests a critique of traditional masculine gender roles of dominance and control. However, Dowell also shows more flexibility in his views of gender through his love for both Florence and Edward. Florence subverts gender stereotypes through her sexual freedom and deceitfulness toward the men in her life, traits traditionally viewed as masculine. Yet she is also dependent on men and uses her sexuality and charm to manipulate them, indicating she remains confined by certain feminine gender roles. 

In conclusion, while Woolf presents gender roles as repressive social constructs that limit women's identities, Ford offers a more complex view of the interplay of gender roles. His characters exhibit a fluidity that subverts strict gender stereotypes, suggesting more ambiguity and room for self-definition. Overall, the novels provide two insightful yet different commentaries on the theme of gender roles in their time."
