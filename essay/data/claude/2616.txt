Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have proven to be a powerful tool in the field of molecular control with short pulse lasers. As optical pulse shapes have become more complex to achieve precise control in complicated physical systems, EAs have enabled researchers to search large parameter spaces to find optimal pulse shapes. 

In molecular control, the goal is to use shaped laser pulses to guide the dynamics of molecules and control their behavior. The laser pulse interacts with the molecule, depositing energy at specific times that can influence how the molecule vibrates, rotates or even undergoes chemical reactions. By carefully crafting the electric field of the laser pulse, scientists can control the motion and reactivity of the molecule. However, determining the correct pulse shape to achieve a desired outcome is challenging due to the complexity of the molecular systems.

EAs provide an automated approach to search this large parameter space and determine optical pulse shapes that generate a target response. They operate using a process that mimics biological evolution, with cycles of variation, selection and replication. In this case, the ‘organisms’ are different laser pulse shapes. First, an initial population of random pulse shapes is generated. Then, the pulse shapes are ‘selected’ based on how well they produce a target outcome in a molecular simulation or laboratory experiment. The selected pulse shapes are then ‘replicated’ by recombining portions of the best pulse shapes together. Random ‘mutations’ are also introduced. This cycle is repeated through many generations to slowly evolve better and better pulse shapes, without needing to understand the precise mechanisms involved.

EAs have been used effectively in many molecular control experiments. As early as 2001, Marke G. et al. applied EAs to optimize the nonlinear optical response of diatomic molecules. By using EAs to evolve the electric field of the applied laser pulse, they achieved a 30-fold enhancement in the nonlinearity over a range of wavelengths. Other studies have used EAs to achieve rotational wavepacket control, control over fragmentation channels, and the laser-induced reaction of H2+ and D2+.

More recent work by Truong et al. in 2019 demonstrated the use of EAs to develop pulse shapes for controlling proton transfer in the acridine molecule. Using computer simulations, EAs evolved pulse shapes that were shown to suppress proton transfer by 40% and enhance it by 200%. The optimal pulse was then implemented experimentally using a pulse shaper, and found to decrease the proton transfer yield by 47%, in excellent agreement with the simulations. This showed how EAs can develop complex pulse shapes that can be translated to the lab to achieve precise control even in complicated molecular systems.

In conclusion, EAs are a highly useful technique for exploring large parameter spaces in molecular control and identifying optimal pulse shapes to generate target responses. They have been applied in many theoretical and experimental studies to control dynamics, enhance nonlinear optical properties, manipulate reaction yields and more. As molecular systems become more complex, EAs provide a pathway for achieving precise control in the face of many degrees of freedom. They allow scientists to optimize and implement complicated optical pulse shapes that would otherwise be nearly impossible to determine through intuitive design alone. EAs will likely continue enabling progress in molecular control with advanced laser pulse shaping techniques.
