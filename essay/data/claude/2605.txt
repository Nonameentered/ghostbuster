Stokes drift refers to the net transport of water masses due to the orbital motions induced by surface gravity waves. As surface waves travel, they generate circular or elliptical motions that cause the water parcels to rotate and drift in the general direction of wave propagation. This wave-driven transport mechanism results in a slow but steady flow, known as the Stokes drift. 

Stokes drift velocity depends on several characteristics of the surface waves, such as their amplitude, frequency, and phase speed. These properties can be investigated using a MATLAB computer program that simulates the wave motions and the resulting Stokes drift. For example, larger wave amplitudes lead to wider orbital movements of water parcels and faster Stokes drift. Higher wave frequencies also induce quicker rotations and stronger Stokes drift velocities. Faster phase speeds, meaning the waves are moving quicker over the ocean surface,  produce enhanced Stokes drift flows in the direction of wave propagation.

The findings from these computer simulations demonstrate that the strength and direction of Stokes drift are directly related to wave parameters that control the vigor and path of orbital circulations. More powerful, rapid, and fast-traveling waves generate stronger Stokes drift flows, while weaker, slower, and stationary waves produce negligible wave-driven transport. The results highlight the significant impact of wave dynamics on this Lagrangian transport mechanism in the upper ocean.

Stokes drift contributes to the net displacement of water masses over large scales. It supplements other transport processes like wind-driven Ekman flows and geostrophic currents. However, the effect of Stokes drift on overall transport depends on the relative directions of the wave-induced flow and other prevailing currents. When Stokes drift acts in the same direction as the mean flow, its effect is additive and causes greater net transport. But when Stokes drift opposes the primary flow, its influence reduces the net displacement of water. 

In conclusion, Stokes drift is an important mechanism for transporting water masses in the upper ocean. This wave-driven flow depends on wave characteristics like amplitude, frequency, and phase speed. Computer simulations modeling different wave parameters have demonstrated how Stokes drift strength and direction are related to these wave properties. While Stokes drift contributes to the net transport of ocean water, its positive or negative effect depends on its orientation relative to other currents. By enhancing our understanding of this transport process, we gain deeper insights into water mass distributions and large-scale circulation patterns in the ocean.
