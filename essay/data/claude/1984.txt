Enteric diseases, or gut infections, in calves can have devastating impacts on the health, growth, and economic viability of cattle operations. Some of the most common enteric diseases in calves include bacterial scours caused by E. coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, cryptosporidium, and salmonella. These diseases often present with symptoms like diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, and in severe cases, death. However, with prompt diagnosis, effective treatments, and good management practices, the incidence and impacts of calf enteric diseases can be greatly reduced.

E. coli is one of the leading causes of enteric disease in calves. E. coli bacteria can infect the gut, leading to a potentially fatal condition known as calf scours. Symptoms of E. coli infection include severe, watery diarrhea, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. Oral or IV fluid therapy, antibiotics, and probiotics are commonly used to treat infected calves. To prevent E. coli outbreaks, calves should receive adequate colostrum immediately after birth to provide immunity, and be fed pasteurized milk or milk replacer rather than unpasteurized waste milk. Hygiene and sanitation around feeding and housing equipment is also critical.  

Rotavirus and coronavirus are two important viral causes of enteric disease in calves. Both cause diarrhea and dehydration, and while less commonly fatal than E. coli, they can significantly impact growth. As viral infections, there are no specific treatments for rotavirus or coronavirus. Supportive care with fluids and electrolytes is key. Modified live vaccines for rotavirus and coronavirus can be given to pregnant cows to boost calf immunity at birth. Proper hygiene, colostrum feeding, and isolation of infected calves also help limit spread.  

Cryptosporidium is a protozoal parasite that infects the gut, causing watery diarrhea in calves usually within the first two weeks of life. Antibiotic and other medical treatments have limited effect against cryptosporidium, so the primary management strategies focus on prevention. Good hygiene, adequately feeding colostrum, using properly filtered and treated water sources, and separately housing calves by age group can help prevent transmission and outbreaks.

In summary, while enteric diseases pose a threat to calf health and performance, there are many tools available to curb their impact. Prompt diagnosis and medical intervention, supporting calves with proper nutrition and hydration, following good hygiene and management practices, monitoring colostrum intake, and isolation techniques are all effective strategies for limiting disease spread and severity. Vaccines, antibiotics, probiotics and other treatments can also be useful when appropriate. By improving management practices and promptly treating infected animals, producers can achieve better calf health, improved growth, and economic gains. With commitment to calf care and disease prevention, enteric disease impacts on UK cattle operations can be minimized.
