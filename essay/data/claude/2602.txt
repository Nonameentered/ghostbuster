Here is a 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

Pascal's Wager is an argument proposed by the French philosopher Blaise Pascal that attempts to provide a rational justification for belief in God through a cost-benefit analysis. Pascal argued that the pragmatic benefits of believing in God outweigh the costs, so rational individuals should believe in God even if the probability of God's existence is uncertain.

Pascal's Wager considers the possible consequences of belief vs unbelief in God across two scenarios - if God exists or does not exist. If God exists and one believes in God, the reward is infinite, as one gains eternal life in Heaven. If God exists but one does not believe, the punishment is also infinite, as one suffers eternal damnation in Hell. If God does not exist, the costs of belief are finite, perhaps some wasted time and effort. The costs of unbelief are also finite.

Given this analysis, Pascal argues that the only rational choice is to believe in God. The possible gain is infinite, so even a small probability of God's existence makes belief worthwhile. The potential loss from not believing is also infinite, so unbelief is never rational. Belief has finite costs at worst, so it dominates unbelief in expected value.  Pascal concludes that we should believe in God for pragmatic reasons, even if we are not certain God exists.

Critics object that Pascal's Wager makes unrealistic assumptions and ignores alternative possibilities. It assumes a false dichotomy between the Christian God and no God. But there are many possible gods and afterlives, so belief does not guarantee infinite gain. Unbelief could also have infinite costs in some religions. The wager also ignores the possibility of an unjust God who punishes believers or rewards skeptics. Moreover, belief is not always a matter of pragmatism or choice - we cannot simply will ourselves to believe something without cause. Belief requires conviction, not just outward behavior, so its costs may not be low. 

In response, Pascal argues the Christian God is the most plausible given available evidence, so belief has the highest expected value. The costs of belief are low if people are open-minded and honest in their inquiry, even if not immediately convinced. He acknowledges belief is not directly chosen but can be influenced by acting as if one believes. By taking part in religious rituals, one may develop genuine conviction over time.

Pascal's Wager offers an innovative argument for rational belief in God based on probability and decision theory. While its assumptions are imperfect, its core insight that belief may be pragmatically rational even if not certainly true has value. Overall, the Wager contributes a thought-provoking case for faith to philosophy of religion.
