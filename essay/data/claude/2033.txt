There are three predominant egg production systems used in the UK for producing chicken eggs: cage systems, barn systems, and free range systems. Each system has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of chicken welfare, egg quality, and consumer preferences. There are several factors that need to be considered to determine which system achieves the best balance between chicken welfare, affordability, and meeting consumer demand.  

Cage systems house chickens in individual cages, usually in large sheds with controlled temperature and lighting. The main advantages of cage systems are affordable egg prices and easier management of the flock. However, cage systems severely restrict the movement and natural behaviors of chickens, leading to poor welfare. Many consumers consider cage eggs to be inhumane and unethical. Several countries and states have banned the use of cage systems for egg laying hens.

In barn systems, chickens are housed together in large open spaces, usually on floor litter with some nest boxes and perches. Barn systems provide more opportunities for chickens to move around and exhibit natural behaviors compared to cage systems. However, the high density of chickens in barns still restricts movement and increases stress, and litter in barns requires frequent maintenance. Barn eggs are moderately more expensive than cage eggs. Some consumers consider barn systems a good compromise between affordability and chicken welfare.  

Free range systems provide chickens access to outdoor spaces in addition to indoor housing. Free range eggs are the most expensive, but many consumers consider them the most humane and highest quality. Free range systems provide chickens the most opportunities to move freely and exhibit natural behaviors. However, free range flocks are difficult to manage and have higher mortality rates due to disease and predation. The label "free range" is not well regulated, and some producers provide little actual access to outdoor spaces despite marketing their eggs as free range.

In conclusion, the factors that should determine the best egg production system include affordability, consumer demand, and ensuring chicken welfare with the ability to exhibit natural behaviors as much as possible. An ideal system achieves high welfare standards for chickens at a price point still affordable and appealing to most consumers. Oversight and regulation are also needed to hold producers accountable to high standards and to ensure consumers are getting what they believe they are paying for. Overall, open systems like well-regulated free range and spacious barn systems currently represent a good balance of these factors compared to restrictive cage systems in the UK egg industry.
