White lupins are leguminous plants that offer significant benefits when included in crop rotations. As nitrogen-fixing plants, white lupins help enrich the soil by converting atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia and nitrates that can be used by subsequent crops. This reduces the need for additional nitrogen fertilizers, which can be costly and have negative environmental impacts. White lupins also have deep taproots that break up hard soil pans and bring nutrients from deeper soil layers to the surface, improving soil structure and fertility for future crops.  

Due to these soil benefits, white lupins make excellent break crops in rotational systems. A break crop is a crop grown in rotation with other crops to interrupt disease, pest, and weed cycles, and provide agronomic benefits to the soil. When used as a break crop, white lupins can help control weeds, diseases, and pests that often afflict cereal crops like wheat or barley when grown continuously. The root systems of white lupins also produce chemicals that can help control nematodes and other soil-borne pathogens that reduce crop yields. By disrupting these disease and pest cycles, white lupins allow farmers to improve yields of cereal crops when they are reintroduced into the rotation.

Compared to other common break crops like canola, peas, or beans, white lupins offer several advantages. They have a higher protein content, producing seed with 35-45% protein that can be used for livestock feed. White lupins also produce higher amounts of biomass, around 10-15 tons per hectare, which provides more organic matter when plowed back into the soil. The deep taproot of white lupins is more effective at breaking up hardpans and accessing nutrients from deep within the soil profile. And as legumes, white lupins fix 50-300 kg of nitrogen per hectare, more than most other break crops.  

For these reasons, white lupins provide substantial benefits when included as break crops in rotational systems. They enrich the soil, control weeds and pests, produce valuable seed and biomass, and outcompete many other break crops on important metrics like nitrogen fixation, biomass production, and root depth. White lupins deserve greater attention and use as an alternative break crop for sustainable crop rotations. Wider adoption of white lupins in this role could help improve soil health, increase yield stability, and support more environmentally-friendly agricultural practices.
