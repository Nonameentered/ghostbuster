Assessing the Service Quality of Staff and Family Accommodation Service Using SERVQUAL Tool: An Evaluation Study 

The SERVQUAL model is a useful tool to assess the service quality of an organization. It measures the gap between customer expectations and perceptions to determine areas of improvement. This essay evaluates the service quality of the Staff and Family Accommodation Service at a university using the SERVQUAL dimensions of tangibility, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy.

The tangibility of the service refers to the appearance of physical facilities, equipment, staff, and communication materials. The accommodation facilities were fairly new and well-maintained, with no visible signs of damage. Common areas like lounges, kitchens, and bathrooms were clean and hygienic. Staff were professionally dressed. However, some of the information on the website and brochures were outdated. The tangibility dimension was moderately fulfilled.

The reliability dimension measures the ability to perform the promised service dependably and accurately. The check-in and check-out process was smooth, and rooms were ready on schedule. Maintenance requests were also addressed promptly. However, the service did not send reminders about events and deadlines at times. The reliability aspect was somewhat achieved. 

Regarding responsiveness, the service was good at providing prompt attention and help to customers. Staff responded quickly to questions, requests, and concerns in person, over the phone, and via email. They were polite, courteous and went out of their way to resolve issues. The responsiveness measure was appropriately met.  

The assurance dimension evaluates staff knowledge, courtesy, and ability to inspire trust and confidence. The frontline staff demonstrated sound knowledge of the facilities, services, and events. They were well-trained, professional, and able to address requests confidently. However, staff could improve on projecting a more friendly and approachable demeanor toward some customers. The assurance aspect was reasonably attained.   

Finally, the empathy dimension refers to caring, customized attention provided to customers. The service showed a satisfactory level of empathy. Staff were able to understand customer needs and consistently provided individualized attention. Although, there were few instances of staff appearing indifferent or apathetic toward customersâ€™ concerns. The empathy measure was fairly achieved.

In conclusion, while the accommodation service performed well on the reliability, responsiveness, and empathy dimensions, there is room for improvement on tangibility, assurance, and reliability aspects. Closing the gaps through regular reviews and staff training could help better fulfill customer expectations and enhance service quality. Overall, the SERVQUAL tool provided a useful framework to evaluate the different dimensions of service quality for the continuous improvement of the Staff and Family Accommodation Service.
