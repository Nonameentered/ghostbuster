Here is a 250 word essay response to the prompt:

To calculate the cost of an order from an array of records with 3 items, you would follow these steps:

1. Define the array of records, which contains 3 items: name, quantity, and price. For example:
[ 
{name: "Apples", quantity: 2, price: 1.20},
{name: "Bananas", quantity: 6, price: 2.50}, 
{name: "Oranges", quantity: 4, price: 1.80}
]

2. Initialize a total cost variable to 0. This will keep a running total of the cost of the order.

3. Loop through each record in the array. On each iteration of the loop: 

- Access the quantity and price fields for the current record. 
- Multiply quantity and price to get the cost for that particular item. 
- Add the cost for that item to the total cost variable.

4. Once the loop has iterated over each record in the array, the total cost variable will contain the final cost of the entire order.

5. Print or return the total cost.

In code, it would look something like this:

let order = [/* array of records */] 
let totalCost = 0

for (let i = 0; i < order.length; i++) {
  let quantity = order[i].quantity
  let price = order[i].price
  let itemCost = quantity * price
  totalCost += itemCost 
}

print(totalCost) // Prints total cost of entire order

So in summary, you loop through the records, calculate the cost for each item by multiplying quantity and price, and add each item's cost to a running total cost variable. Once you've iterated the entire array, the total cost variable contains the final cost of the full order.
