Estimates indicate that between 10 to 15% of the population is left-handed. For a characteristic that affects a substantial minority of people, left-handedness remains an enigma in many ways. Researchers have explored whether being left-handed correlates with a variety of traits, especially tendencies towards certain careers, clumsiness, and reliance on the right brain hemisphere. However, the research on these correlations has been mixed and, at times, conflicting. 

Some studies have suggested that left-handers trend towards careers that require divergent or artistic thinking, such as in the arts, architecture, and music. The hypothesis is that since the right brain hemisphere is dominant in left-handers, and the right brain is associated with creativity, left-handers are well-suited for these fields. However, meta-analyses of studies on this correlation have found little evidence to support it. While there are certainly prominent left-handed artists, actors, and musicians, overall left-handers do not seem strongly predisposed to choosing these careers.

Clumsiness or difficulty with spatial skills is another trait sometimes associated with left-handers. Some research has found that left-handers perform worse on spatial ability tests and tend to be overrepresented in populations with learning disabilities like dyslexia that affect spatial skills. However, other studies have found no evidence that left-handers are less adept at spatial skills overall. As with career choice, while there may be a subset of left-handers who struggle with certain spatial tasks, there does not appear to be a strong correlation between left-handedness and clumsiness. 

Some of the most consistent findings relate to brain hemisphere dominance. Most studies confirm that left-handers tend to rely more on the right hemisphere of the brain, especially for language functions. This is logical given that the left brain hemisphere controls the right side of the body, and vice versa. However, while left-handers as a group demonstrate greater right hemisphere dominance, there is no consensus on what impacts, if any, this has on psychological traits or characteristics.

In summary, while popular notions hold that left-handers are more prone to being creative, clumsy, or displaying other behavioral tendencies, scientific evidence for these correlations is limited or conflicting. Overall, there is little confirmation that left-handed people differ dramatically from right-handed people in either their cognitive or physical abilities. Left-handedness remains an interesting but enigmatic topic that continues to puzzle both researchers and left-handers themselves in its implications. The research seems to suggest that while there may be broad neurological differences between left-handers and right-handers, these differences do not translate clearly into differences in characteristics, behaviors, or occupational predispositions. There appears to be considerable diversity among left-handers as among any group.
