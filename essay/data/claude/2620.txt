The study of countryside and medieval villages in archaeology has evolved significantly from the 1960s to the 1990s. In the 1960s, the prevailing approach was the reconstruction of village plans and the mapping of settlement forms. Archaeologists focused on understanding village morphology and layouts. The New Archaeology movement influenced archaeology in the 1970s, bringing a more scientific and anthropological approach. Archaeologists aimed to understand human behavior and social organization underlying the physical remains of villages. In the 1980s and 1990s, post-processualism led to a greater emphasis on symbolism, identity, and meaning. Archaeologists sought to understand how village spaces were used and gave meaning in people's lives. 

In the 1960s, archaeologists like Maurice Beresford pioneered the systematic mapping and excavation of deserted medieval villages in England. The goal was to understand medieval settlement planning and the reasons for village abandonment. Archaeologists reconstructed village plans, mapped boundaries, and delineated tofts and crofts to understand village layouts and how space was organized. The predominant questions revolved around morphological changes to settlement patterns over time. This approach was largely descriptive, with a focus on mapping, surveying, and reconstructing the physical remains of settlements.

The rise of the New Archaeology movement in the 1970s brought a more anthropological and scientific approach to the study of villages. Archaeologists aimed to understand the rules and regularities that governed human behavior in the past. They sought to understand the social and economic organization that shaped how village space was used. Questions revolved around landholding patterns, agricultural regimes, and the relationship between lords and peasants. Studies focused on spatial organization within villages to infer social organization. The excavation of houses and barns was also prioritized to understand agricultural activities and living standards.

In the 1980s and 1990s, post-processualism led archaeologists to consider villages through the lens of symbolism, meaning, and identity. The use of village space and the built environment was understood as a means for humans to construct and negotiate identity and social relations. Archaeologists studied village spaces like greens, ritual buildings, and boundaries to understand how they shaped community and group identity. Questions revolved around symbolic meanings, social memory, and the role of space and place in the daily lives of villagers.

Several factors influenced these changes in how archaeologists have studied villages. The rise of new theoretical movements like the New Archaeology and post-processualism introduced new questions and approaches. Technological advances enabled new methods, such as aerial photography, field surveying, and radiocarbon dating. Interdisciplinary collaboration with fields like geography, history, and anthropology also shaped new perspectives. Finally, political and social changes, such as an interest in marginalized groups, led to new emphases, such as a focus on peasants, rituals, and symbolism. 

In summary, village archaeology has shifted from a focus on morphology and layouts to understanding human behavior and the symbolic aspects of village spaces. The study of villages has become more anthropological, scientific, and socially aware. New theories, methods, collaboration, and social changes have all contributed to how archaeologists understand and study the medieval countryside and village life.
