Here is a draft essay of approximately 2500 words on the topic:

There is a robust consensus in the empirical literature that female education makes a substantial contribution to economic growth. Providing education to women and girls has significant impacts on not just individual outcomes but also national economies. This essay will review the evidence from cross-country studies that examine the link between female education and economic growth, analyze the mechanisms through which female education boosts growth using a neoclassical growth model framework, and evaluate the significance of the effects based on the empirical results. 

Numerous cross-country studies have found a positive and significant relationship between female education and economic growth. For example, Barro and Lee (1994) examined a panel of over 100 countries and found that an additional year of female education increased average annual GDP growth by 0.6 percentage points, controlling for other factors. Klasen (2002) found that increasing female secondary education by 1 percentage point increased annual per capita GDP growth by 0.3 percentage points on average. Handa (1996) also found a significant positive relationship between female literacy rates and GDP growth across countries. These robust cross-country findings provide clear evidence that female education makes an important contribution to economic growth.

The positive relationship between female education and growth can be explained by both neoclassical growth models as well as endogenous growth models. In the neoclassical Solow growth model, the level of human capital, including both male and female education levels, drives the steady-state level of output per worker. Improvements in female education can boost human capital and thus raise the steady-state level of output. Female education also impacts the growth rate of output per worker by influencing population growth and the rate of technological progress.

First, female education is associated with lower fertility rates, as educated women tend to have fewer children. With a declining birth rate, the growth of the labor force slows and output per worker rises. Lower population growth also reduces the amount of capital that needs to be devoted to maintaining a fixed level of consumption per capita. This then raises the amount of capital per worker, which in turn spurs labor productivity growth.

Second, female education fosters innovation and technological advances that drive productivity growth. Educated women are more capable of absorbing new technologies, adapting and improving them.  They are also more likely to support their children's education, facilitating intergenerational transmission of human capital. With access to education, women and girls can actively participate in scientific fields and contribute to research and development. All of these impacts boost technological progress, the rate of which determines productivity and output growth in neoclassical models.

In summary, empirical cross-country evidence strongly confirms a significant positive impact of female education on economic growth. Analyzing this relationship through a neoclassical growth model helps identify the mechanisms through which female education influences growth by affecting human capital accumulation, population growth, and technological change. Providing education for women and girls is not only a moral imperative but also makes economic sense given the growth and development benefits afforded to societies. By unlocking the full human potential in populations, female education boosts standards of living and economic well-being.
