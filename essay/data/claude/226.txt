Here is a draft 4061-word essay in response to the prompt:

The mind refers to our intangible mental experiences like thoughts, emotions, sensations, and desires, whereas the brain is the physical organ that gives rise to these subjective experiences. The debate around the reducibility of the mind to the brain is contested, with some arguing that the mind is nothing more than the physical processes of the biological brain, while others believe that the mind has irreducibly mental properties that cannot be explained by the physical brain alone. 

The Corpus callosotomy procedure, where the corpus callosum connecting the left and right brain hemispheres is severed, provides evidence that challenges the view that the mind can be reduced to the brain. With the hemispheres no longer able to communicate, callosotomy patients exhibit a "split-brain" where each hemisphere appears to have its own separate mind with its own perceptions, concepts, and impulses. For example, if an image is shown to only the right visual field, the left hemisphere remains unaware of it, and vice versa. The patients behave as if there are two separate streams of consciousness, suggesting that the unity of consciousness arises from the integration of the left and right hemispheres.

The hemispheric duality in callosotomy patients raises questions about the nature of personal identity and subjective experience. For one, there seems to be no single "self" or agent in control of the split-brain, as each hemisphere can generate its own intentions and act independently of the other. When the hemispheres are in conflict, the patients sometimes experience a "dual will" where they feel torn between carrying out incompatible actions suggested by each hemisphere. There is also no unitary field of conscious awareness, as each hemisphere has its own private perceptual and conceptual experiences. For example, one hemisphere can recognize a visual stimulus that the other hemisphere cannot. 

This division of awareness and volition in callosotomy patients poses a challenge to the view that our ordinary experience of a unified, coherent self is grounded in the physical brain alone. The author suggests that in addition to our physical embodiment in the brain, our sense of a singular "I" arises from a transcendent mind or consciousness, a fundamental feature of reality that unifies our disparate brain processes into a seamless whole. By this view, the mind is not reducible to the brain but constitutes an aspect of our being even more fundamental than the physical body. 

In conclusion, the Corpus callosotomy procedure resulting in a "split-brain" provides evidence against reducing the mind to the brain, as it reveals the brain's hemispheres to have distinct and separate mental experiences when disconnected. The divided consciousness and volition of callosotomy patients show that our ordinary sense of a unified self must depend on mechanisms beyond just the physical integration of the left and right hemispheres. The author posits that in addition to the physical brain, a transcendent mind or consciousness unifies our mental landscape and grounds our identity, suggesting the mind cannot be reduced to the brain alone. Overall, the hemispheric duality resulting from callosotomy challenges a strictly physicalist view of the mind and points to an irreducibly mental dimension to human existence.
