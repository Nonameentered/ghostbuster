Here is a draft 1500-word essay in response to the prompt:

The Sino-Japanese controversy over the content of Japan's history textbooks with regard to atrocities in World War 2 is one that frequently makes headlines and stokes nationalistic sentiments in both countries. The way this issue is covered in the media of both China and Japan is deeply intertwined with longstanding biases and grievances between the countries. 

In China, the media coverage of Japan's history textbooks tends to be very critical and casts the issue as one of Japan not properly acknowledging and apologizing for war crimes. Chinese media outlets frequently claim that Japan's textbooks whitewash or downplay events like the Nanjing Massacre. They portray Japan as still being militaristic and as posing a threat to China. These media narratives tap into Chinese nationalism and a sense of victimhood at the hands of Japanese imperialism. They suggest Japan has not done enough to make amends for its past atrocities.

In contrast, Japan's media coverage of this issue tends to be very defensive of the government's position that its history textbooks are appropriate and factually accurate. The media argues that China and South Korea exaggerate the issue and manipulate historical facts for political purposes. They claim that Japan has apologized enough for its past and that demands for further apologies are unreasonable. They tap into Japanese nationalism by portraying China as a threat that bullies Japan over historical issues. The overall framing is that China stirs up controversy about the textbooks for propaganda and political gain.

Both sides, then, have strong media biases that frame the issue in nationalist ways and perpetuate a cycle of grievances. The Chinese media taps into a sense of victimization that demands more apologies and acknowledgment of injustice, while the Japanese media adopts a defensive posture and portrays China as an unreasonable bully. These mutually antagonistic media narratives harden public opinion in both countries and make compromise or reconciliation more difficult. They turn the history textbook issue into a proxy for the larger geopolitical rivalry and tensions between China and Japan.

In conclusion, the Sino-Japanese controversy over Japan's history textbooks is a complex issue that is deeply embedded within a web of nationalist media biases and long-held grievances in both countries. The media coverage on both sides frames the issue in an antagonistic manner that plays to nationalistic audiences, hardens public opinion, and hinders diplomatic progress. The role of media bias is central to understanding why this history textbook issue remains so contentious and unresolved. Overall, this case study highlights how media and public opinion can pose obstacles to reconciliation even when governments seek to improve relations.
