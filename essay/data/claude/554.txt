The two cases discussed in this essay involve a bottleneck analysis at a computer manufacturing facility and a capacity planning analysis at an electric transmission contractor. These cases provide examples of applying production planning and control theories into practical real-world situations.

In the first case,  bottleneck analysis techniques were used to identify constraints at a computer manufacturing facility that was struggling with low throughput and long lead times. By identifying the bottleneck workstation as the speed limiter in the process, the facility was able to make targeted investments to alleviate this constraint. Doing so maximized the output of the system and reduced lead times overall using the theory of constraints. This demonstrates how bottleneck identification and analysis provides a framework for optimizing process flow in a practical production setting.

The second case involved determining how much additional work an electric transmission contractor could take on without sacrificing quality or delivery performance. By analyzing current capacity, work in progress, and staffing levels, the contractor was able to set a target threshold for new work that would not strain the system. This capacity planning exercise utilized several theories around throughput, lead time, and work in progress to set practical limits on production volume based on the contractor's specific situation and capabilities. 

In summary, the two cases analyzed provide examples of how concepts from  production planning and control systems can be applied to optimize practical manufacturing and operational environments. Using tools like bottleneck analysis, constraint management, throughput calculation, and capacity planning, organizations can gain valuable insights into how to improve process flow, reduce lead times, set optimal production volumes, and maximize productivity in their unique settings. The theoretical frameworks provide guidance, but practical application involves adapting the concepts to match each organization's products, processes, and priorities.
