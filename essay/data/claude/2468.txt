A ballast controller is an electronic device used to help stabilize the operation of an electrical generator. Specifically, it helps regulate voltage and improve efficiency when the load on the generator is changing. Without a ballast controller, the voltage and power output of a generator can fluctuate significantly as the load increases or decreases.

The basic function of a ballast controller is to inject more or less current into the generator's rotor to maintain stable voltage and frequency. As the load on the generator increases, the ballast controller injects more current to boost the magnetic field in the rotor, which in turn boosts the voltage and power output. When the load decreases, the ballast controller reduces the current to the rotor to prevent overvoltage. This stabilizing effect allows the generator to operate closer to its maximum efficiency regardless of changing load conditions.

An induction machine micro-hydro scheme, where an induction generator is turned by flowing water, can benefit greatly from a ballast controller. The flow rate of the water, and thus the speed of the generator, can vary over time due to factors like rainfall and water demand. A ballast controller helps ensure consistent voltage and frequency even as the generator speed changes. The excess power generated during high-flow periods can then be used for other purposes.

One possible use of excess power is to charge batteries that can provide power during low-flow periods when less power is generated. The excess power could also be supplied to the local electricity grid if permitted. Other potential uses include powering water pumps and filtration systems, space heating, or other residential and commercial loads. A micro-hydro scheme with an efficient ballast control system can help communities become energy self-sufficient by maximizing the use of available local resources.

In summary, a ballast controller helps stabilize the voltage and improve the efficiency of an electrical generator under varying load conditions. For an induction machine micro-hydro system, a ballast controller can help make the most of available water flow rates by maintaining consistent power output and enabling the use of excess generated power for other purposes. Ballast control makes micro-hydro a more viable and robust power solution, especially for off-grid communities.
