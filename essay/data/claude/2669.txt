Here is a draft 2250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Biological control, the use of natural enemies to suppress pest populations, offers an environmentally-friendly alternative to chemical pesticides in horticulture and agriculture. However, there are significant ecological risks associated with introducing biological control agents that must be carefully considered. Whether used in controlled environments like greenhouses or open fields, biological control agents can have unintended effects on non-target species and the surrounding ecosystem. 

In controlled environments like greenhouses, host-specific biological control agents with a narrow target range are often preferred as they pose little risk to most non-target species. For example, the parasitoid wasp Encarsia formosa is highly effective against whitefly pests in greenhouses but does not parasitize other insects. However, even host-specific agents used indoors can impact non-targets if they escape into the local environment. The predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis, used to control spider mites in greenhouses, has been found in the wild, posing a potential threat to native predatory mites. Tightly controlled use and containment practices are needed to minimize escapes.

In open field situations, more generalist biological control agents are frequently employed as they can control a wider range of common pests. For example, the predatory beetle Delphastus pusillus is used against multiple soft-bodied pests like aphids, whiteflies, spider mites and thrips. However, generalist predators often pose higher risks to non-target species through direct predation or competition. The introduction of Delphastus pusillus in Australian vineyards led to the extinction of native predatory beetles that had previously helped naturally suppress pest mites. Once established in the open, generalist agents can spread widely and be difficult to eradicate.

The long-term effects of biological control agents on the environment are challenging to predict. Some agents do not become permanently established and naturally die out after controlling the initial target pest. However, others may spread, displace native species, and become invasive. For example, the parasitic fly Compsilura concinnata was introduced in 1906 to control gypsy moths but then began to attack over 200 non-target species of moths and butterflies across North America. Even agents that appear safe in small-scale trials can act invasively over the long run. 

To mitigate these risks, strict regulations and screening procedures are needed to assess biological control agents before introduction and carefully monitor them afterward. Proposed agents should be evaluated for host-specificity and potential non-target effects through laboratory and field testing. Initial introductions should be small-scale so that unexpected effects can be detected early. Post-introduction monitoring should track the distribution and impact of agents on both target and non-target species. If negative effects are found, the agent may need to be removed from use.

With proper regulations and oversight, biological control can be used sustainably to control pests in horticulture. However, we must fully consider the ecological risks posed by introducing natural enemies, even those that appear host-specific or provide economic benefits. Our environment depends on the complex relationships between species, and any manipulation has the potential for unforeseen consequences. A precautionary approach is needed to protect biodiversity and maintain the health of our ecosystems.
