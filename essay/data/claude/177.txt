The arrival of the English East India Company in India in the early 1600s significantly disrupted existing trade networks in Asia and introduced new tensions between merchant groups. Prior to the entrance of the EIC, trade in India and across Asia was facilitated by Indian merchants and governed by the Mughal Empire. The EIC's incursion into this system introduced new competition that threatened the livelihoods of established merchants, leading to an evolving and often adversarial relationship between European companies and Indian traders.  

Trade in pre-colonial India was built on networks established by hereditary merchant communities that had specialized in facilitating the transportation and sale of goods for centuries. These included communities like the Chettis, Marwaris, and Multanis, who were embedded in regional and inter-regional trade networks across Asia. They traded high-value goods like textiles, spices, opium, and precious metals, and had established commercial centers throughout India where merchants from across Asia would gather to exchange goods. Trade was highly regulated by the Mughal Empire, which imposed taxes on goods and set guidelines for commercial activity. 

The EIC entered this system in the early 1600s and established itself as a competitor to traditional merchant groups. It possessed superior naval power and began illegally controlling sea trade routes, disrupting the operations of Indian coastal merchants. The EIC also had vast capital and began dominating the trade of high-value goods like textiles and spices, causing Indian traders to lose substantial business. This competition introduced economic anxieties and hostility between Indian merchants and the EIC.

However, the relationship between the groups was not strictly adversarial. Indian merchants also worked with and benefited from the EIC's operations. They acted as local agents and intermediaries for the EIC, utilizing their regional trade networks to source goods for export. They also sold Indian goods to the EIC for maritime trade. The expansion of trade overall increased the volume of commercial activity in India, which many Indian merchants were able to gain from despite competitive pressures. 

The Mughal Empire responded inconsistently to the EIC, at times working with them and at times seeing them as a threat to economic stability and political authority. The Mughals were unable to curb the EIC's growing control of maritime trade but aimed to regulate their activities within Mughal territory. They oscillated between collecting revenues from the EIC's trading and imposing restrictions when EIC actions were perceived as too politically or economically destabilizing.

In conclusion, the arrival of the English East India Company in India significantly disrupted pre-existing trade networks by introducing new economic competition that threatened traditional merchant groups. However, the relationship that emerged between the EIC and Indian merchants was complex, involving both cooperation and competition. The Mughal Empire attempted to respond to and regulate the EIC's activities with limited success.  The incursion of the EIC ultimately transformed systems of trade that had shaped Asia for centuries.
