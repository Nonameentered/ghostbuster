The purpose of this assignment was to design and construct a Wheatstone bridge deflection system to measure small changes in resistance under loading conditions. The Wheatstone bridge with an amplifier was built to accurately measure microstrains induced in a beam under bending. By measuring the change in resistance of the strain gauges, the strain in the beam could be calculated. 

The first step was to select appropriate strain gauges that would provide a measurable change in resistance for the expected microstrains. Strain gauges with a gauge factor of 2 were selected, meaning a 1% change in length would produce a 2% change in resistance. These strain gauges had a nominal resistance of 120Î©. Four strain gauges were mounted to the beam, two on the top surface and two on the bottom surface at the location of maximum strain. These were connected in a full Wheatstone bridge configuration with the two top gauges connected on adjacent legs and the two bottom gauges on the opposite legs. This setup allowed for temperature compensation since the gauge resistances would change similarly with temperature.

The bridge was powered by a 10V DC power supply. The output of the bridge was connected to an instrumentation amplifier with a gain of 100 to amplify the small voltage changes produced from the variations in strain gauge resistance. The amplifier had a differential input to eliminate any common mode signals. Its output was read by a high resolution ADC to measure voltage changes on the order of microvolts.

To reduce noise in the system and produce more accurate strain measurements, a low pass filter was added at the output of the amplifier. Without the filter, the output contained high frequency noise that made small signal changes difficult to detect. A cutoff frequency of 10Hz was selected to filter out high frequency noise while still allowing the signal to respond to strain changes at lower frequencies. 

The beam was loaded at midspan to induce bending strain. As the load increased in small increments, the change in bridge output voltage was measured to calculate the induced strain. The filter proved effective at reducing high frequency noise by up to 50%, which improved the resolution and accuracy of the strain measurements. 

In summary, a full Wheatstone bridge with four strain gauges was constructed to convert strain to a measurable change in resistance. An instrumentation amplifier gain of 100 was used to amplify the small voltage changes, and a low pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 10Hz was employed to reduce high frequency noise by up to 50% for improved accuracy. The setup was able to detect microstrain-level induced bending in a beam under loading. With further calibration, this deflection bridge and amplifier system could be used for highly sensitive strain and displacement measurements.
