Recent theories about burial practices have provided new insights into social relations and hierarchy in ancient societies. Scholars have examined how the elaboration and wealth displayed in burials can reflect the status and social complexity of a community. However, the relationship between burial ostentation and the deceased's status is complex. While rich burials often indicate a high-status individual, we cannot rely solely on the lavishness of a burial to determine the social position of the interred. 

Some of the most influential recent theories of burial practices focus on the role of burials in signaling status and reinforcing social hierarchies. For example, elite burials with rare, valuable grave goods are thought to reflect and articulate social stratification, demonstrating the power and prestige of the most privileged classes. The conspicuous consumption of wealth in lavish burials is a way for elites to visibly distinguish themselves from lower-status individuals. However, while rich burials often reflect high status, the reverse is not always true - high-status individuals are not always buried with the most lavish assemblages of rare and precious goods.

Scholars have also linked increasing social complexity with more elaborate burial rites and monumental tombs. More complex societies with greater degrees of craft specialization, trade networks, and social stratification are thought to engage in more complex burial practices. For example, the appearance of megalithic monuments and tombs in Neolithic Europe indicates the emergence of more stratified, complex societies with a surplus of labor and resources. However, while there is a general trend linking complexity and elaborate burials, there are many exceptions. Some complex societies engaged in relatively simple burial rites, while some small-scale societies produced monumental tombs.  

Although rich, lavish burials often reflect high status and social complexity, we cannot rely entirely on the ostentation and wealth in burials to make assumptions about the deceased's position or societal organization. There are several reasons burial assemblages may not directly reflect the status or role of the interred. For one, grave goods may have symbolic rather than material value. They may reflect the religious beliefs and rituals of a community rather than the personal wealth or status of the deceased. Additionally, grave goods could be offered by mourners to express their grief, not necessarily to convey the prestige of the deceased.

In some cases, an individual's role and status within a community may not be reflected in their burial treatment after death. For example, in some societies religious or community leaders who renounced material wealth in life were buried without lavish grave goods that would normally signify high status. Additionally, an individual's social role and relationships are complex and multi-dimensional. An individual's occupation, religious role, age, and other attributes could all contribute to their status, but some factors may be more prominently displayed in burial than others.
