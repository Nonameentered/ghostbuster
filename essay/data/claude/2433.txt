Epiphytes are plants that grow on other plants, but are not parasitic. They do not harm their host plant. Epiphytes obtain nutrients and water that pools on the branches, leaves and bark of host plants, but do not penetrate the tissues of their hosts. Rather, they function more like tenants living off the services and shelter offered by their host plants. Unlike parasites, epiphytes do not deprive their hosts of nutrients or resources and rely entirely on trapping windblown debris, rain and fog for their nutrients and water.

Some common examples of epiphytes include mosses, ferns, orchids, bromeliads such as the pineapple plant, and some species of cacti. These plants are adapted to grow upon the branches and trunks of trees in tropical and subtropical rainforests where the humidity and rainfall is optimal for their growth. They do not root in the ground, but rather anchor themselves on their hosts using root-like structures that cling onto the host's surface. However, they do not penetrate into the host tissues. In order to obtain water and nutrients, epiphytes have special adaptations such as leaves that can trap rain, fog and debris, specialized roots that can efficiently absorb moisture, and the ability to store water and nutrients for use during dry periods. Their suspended lifestyle gives epiphytes an advantage over ground-dwelling plants in that they have better access to sunlight and the ability to intercept scarce resources like nutrients and water before they reach the forest floor.   

Epiphytes obtain water through several means. Their leaves often have a structure and surface adapted to trap moisture from the atmosphere, such as the tank leaves found in bromeliads which can hold standing water. Some epiphytes have thin, numerous roots that can absorb moisture and nutrients from the air and rainwater that pools on the surface of their hosts. These roots are very efficient at absorbing moisture and nutrients. Epiphytes are also able to store water in their leaves and stems, with some bromeliads capable of holding several liters of water. These water storage adaptations help epiphytes survive periodic dry spells.

To obtain nutrients, epiphytes rely on trapping fallen leaves, debris and organic matter that collect on their host plants. Their roots are very efficient at absorbing nutrients from these trapped materials. Epiphytes also have a symbiotic relationship with bacteria, fungi and algae that help them fix nitrogen from the air and absorb other nutrients. Some epiphytes can also obtain minor amounts of nutrients from their hosts through foliar leaching or abscised flower parts and leaves that fall onto them. However, epiphytes do not penetrate their hosts' tissues and are not parasitic. 

In summary, epiphytes are adapted to an aerial lifestyle by obtaining water and nutrients from non-parasitic means. Their ability to absorb moisture and trap scarce resources, along with adaptations that allow them to store these materials, give epiphytes a competitive advantage in rainforest environments that other plants do not have. While epiphytes depend on other plants for physical support and shelter, they do not harm their hosts and live independently by relying on trapped debris, rainfall and atmospheric moisture for sustenance. Epiphytism is a successful ecological strategy for plants in tropical and subtropical forests where resources are scarce under the forest canopy.
