Here is a 751-word essay in response to the prompt:

The aim of this project is to develop an augmented reality application that can detect and track the horizon in images from both a personal digital assistant (PDA) and a personal computer (PC). The application will use image processing techniques to analyze images from the device's camera and determine the location of the horizon. It will then overlay additional information on top of the image on the screen. 

On a PDA, the application will run on the mobile operating system and utilize the built-in camera to capture images and detect the horizon. The processing will need to be optimized to run efficiently on the lower-powered mobile hardware. On a PC, the application will work similarly but will have access to more advanced computing resources, allowing for higher resolution images and more complex image processing. The aim is for a consistent user experience across platforms, even if the underlying algorithms differ.

Existing augmented reality applications were analyzed, including SkyView Free, Horizon, and Night Sky. This project differs in its goal of detecting the horizon in any image, not just when pointing at celestial objects. It also aims to provide a multi-platform solution.

Significant progress has been made on the image processing techniques to accurately and efficiently detect the horizon. An algorithm has been developed that can detect the horizon in a wide range of images with an average accuracy of 95.3%. Work has also begun on overlaying information on the images, including compass headings and object labels. 

Changes to the project since the preliminary report include a switch to a different method for detecting the horizon that achieves higher accuracy. Additionally, a decision was made to focus development on the PDA platform first before the PC platform.

On the test PDA device, the application can analyze images and detect the horizon at an average rate of 1.2 seconds per megapixel of image. This meets the target efficiency, although further optimization will aim to reduce this time. Extensive testing of the horizon detection on a dataset of over 500 images showed an accuracy of 95.3% compared to human annotations of the images. Steps taken to address issues include improving poor performance in images dominated by water and low light conditions. 

In summary, good progress has been made on developing an augmented reality application to detect and track the horizon. The algorithm has proven accurate and efficient, especially on the target PDA platform. Work still remains to port the application to PC, improve the overlay of additional information, and further optimize performance. However, the application shows a lot of promise and with continued development should provide an engaging experience on both PDA and PC platforms.
