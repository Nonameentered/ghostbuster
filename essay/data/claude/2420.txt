A SWOT analysis is a strategic tool used by businesses to evaluate their current position and inform future planning. SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. Conducting a SWOT analysis involves identifying and assessing these four factors that can impact a business.

For farms looking to diversify into new areas like agritourism or value-added products, a SWOT analysis is particularly important. It allows farm owners to gain insight into their existing capabilities and resources that could support diversification (Strengths), understand any constraints or disadvantages they need to address (Weaknesses), spot new market openings or niches they could take advantage of (Opportunities), and determine any external challenges that could undermine their efforts (Threats).

Some examples of strengths for a farm diversification SWOT analysis include: existing infrastructure like barns or facilities that could be repurposed, strong community ties and customer base, unique or high-quality products, and skills/expertise of the farm owners. Weaknesses may include lack of marketing experience, remote location, lack of start-up capital, or limited time to devote to a new venture.  

Opportunities could include growing demand for farm-to-table or sustainable food options, increase in agritourism due to COVID-19 and desire for outdoor recreation, or availability of grants and programs to support farm diversification. Threats may include additional regulations on new farm activities, competition from larger players, economic downturn impacting customer spending, or a rebound from COVID-19 reducing interest in local food or agritourism.  

By identifying the key strengths to build upon, weaknesses to address, opportunities to capture, and threats to mitigate, a SWOT analysis provides farms with a blueprint for how to strategically diversify their business while maximizing the odds of success. It helps ensure new ventures are well-suited to the farmâ€™s unique situation and aligned with their long term vision. For any farm looking to diversify through new crops, products, experiences or marketing channels, conducting a comprehensive SWOT analysis is a vital first step.
