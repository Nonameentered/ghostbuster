To a certain extent, Hong Kong secondary schools have achieved success in instilling national identity in students, but they still face many challenges in fully transmitting a strong sense of national belonging. In the past decade, perceptions and practices of national education in Hong Kong have evolved to become more comprehensive and multidimensional. Schools now adopt a variety of strategies to cultivate national identity, though effectiveness varies between schools of different backgrounds. Teachers see themselves as facilitators in developing students’ national consciousness, but their approaches are shaped by their own understandings of national identity. Promoting national education through free market incentives is a controversial strategy that may address some existing challenges but also introduce new issues.  

In terms of successes, the implementation of national education as an independent compulsory subject in primary and secondary schools since 2012 has raised students’ awareness of national identity and their sense of belonging to China. Schools organize celebratory activities around National Day and use curriculum and extracurricular programs to teach students national symbols, cultural traditions, and history. Students today demonstrate stronger national sentiments in surveys and interviews. However, confusion about national identity among students still persists, and schools struggle with how to balance nationalistic and patriotic education with Hong Kong’s local identity. The rapid transformation of curricula and materials has also created difficulties for schools and teachers to keep up.   

Practices of national education have become more diverse, multidimensional and flexible over the past decade. In addition to formal national education classes, schools adopt integrated and interactive approaches like talks, exhibitions, debates, competencies and exchange tours to China. This shift reflects an understanding that national identity is complex and multifaceted. Schools and teachers with stronger nationalistic orientations tend to emphasize patriotism and pride in China's achievements, while others focus more on cultural traditions and civic responsibilities. Schools also differ in how much they associate national identity with the central government and the Communist party. 

Teachers see themselves as key to cultivating students’ national identity, but they vary in how proactively they disseminate nationalistic values and how they perceive their proper role. Some teachers feel strongly obligated to foster love for the motherland, while others believe their duty is to develop students' independent and critical thinking about national issues. The diverse backgrounds and experiences of teachers also lead to different interpretations of national identity and approaches to national education.

Promoting national education through market forces and incentives for schools is a complex strategy that faces both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, it encourages innovation and gives schools flexibility to develop programs suited to their contexts. It mobilizes the private sector and non-governmental organizations to participate in building national identity. However, it also commercializes and trivializes the important process of value inculcation. The reliance on market mechanisms may exacerbate existing disparities between schools and students. There are also concerns that economic incentives would divert focus from the real purpose of national education.

In conclusion, while national education in Hong Kong has achieved certain successes in cultivating national identity, many challenges remain around how to develop a sense of national belonging that complements Hong Kong’s local identity. A variety of strategies have been adopted to make national education more comprehensive, but their effectiveness depends on the orientations and goals of specific schools. Teachers play a crucial role, but they need more support to develop shared understandings around the desired models of national identity and the best practices for transmitting nationalistic values. Employing market forces may be part of an solution but should not be the sole solution. Close monitoring and adjustment are required to overcome potential issues from the commercialization and unequal access to resources.
