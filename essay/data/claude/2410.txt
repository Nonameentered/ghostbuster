Here is a potential 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

A computer simulation to model the atomic structure of amorphous Dy7Ni3 alloy will be developed using the Metropolis Monte Carlo method. This stochastic approach allows the atomic configuration of the system to be optimized by accepting or rejecting proposed atomic moves based on the energy change. The atomic moves, including displacements, swaps, and rotations, will be proposed randomly to explore the configuration space of the system. By accepting moves that lower the total potential energy and occasionally accepting moves that increase the energy based on a Boltzmann probability factor, the system can escape from local energy minima and find the overall lowest energy configuration at a given temperature.

The total potential energy of the system will be calculated as the sum of all pairwise interatomic interactions. For Dy-Ni, Ni-Ni, and Dy-Dy pairs, a Lennard-Jones potential with fitted parameters will be used to represent the repulsive core and attractive tail of the interaction. The Lennard-Jones  parameters will be optimized to best match available experimental data on interatomic distances obtained through extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy or diffraction techniques. By comparing the resulting radial distribution functions from simulations to experimental data, the Lennard-Jones parameters can be refined to improve the accuracy of the model.

To avoid edge effects in the simulation of the bulk material, ghost boxes will be employed whereby each face of the simulation box will be replicated in all directions. Atoms interact normally within the central box but any atom that moves into a ghost box is reflected back into the original box. This creates the illusion of an infinite, periodic system. The dimensions of the ghost boxes can be optimized to ensure no finite size effects influence the central box. 

The optimized structure from simulations can provide valuable insight into the atomic arrangement of the metal and rare earth species in the amorphous solid. By analyzing the clusters, voids, and interatomic distances, a better understanding of the factors stabilizing the amorphous state can be gained. Rare earth-transition metal glasses are an important class of metallic glasses; studying model systems like Dy7Ni3 can help in developing theories around their structure and properties. The program outlined here would serve as a useful tool to simulate Dy7Ni3 and potentially tailor the composition and processing to improve the properties of the metallic glass.
