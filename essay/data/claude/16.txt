Jean-Jacques Rousseau's concept of the general will represents an important step forward in political philosophy in articulating a vision of popular sovereignty and democratic governance. However, his belief that individuals should submit their own wills to the general will of the collective poses potential risks to individual liberty. 

Rousseau argues in The Social Contract that the general will represents the will of the people as a whole and aims for the common good. It is not merely the aggregate of individual wills, but rather the will that aims for what benefits society overall. Rousseau believes individuals must submit their personal wills and interests to this general will. Only by doing so can true freedom and liberty be achieved, as individuals' dependence on one another is recognized and the collective interests of society reign supreme.

This vision poses some threats to individual liberty. First, it can justify the tyranny of the majority and encourage groupthink. If the general will is simply what the majority wants, it can lead to the oppression of minority groups and dissenting opinions. The majority is not always right, and controversial or unpopular ideas are not always against the common good. But in submitting to the general will, individuals may feel pressure to conform rather than voice dissent.  

Second, it is difficult to determine what exactly constitutes the general will. There will inevitably be disagreements over what benefits the common good and society as a whole. If the general will is ambiguous or open to interpretation, it can be co-opted by those in power to justify policies that mainly benefit them rather than society. Leaders can claim the mantle of the general will to advance their own agendas and entrench their power.

However, the threats to individual liberty posed by Rousseau's vision can be overstated. Rousseau himself recognized that the general will could be distorted without safeguards like a robust education system and free flow of information. The general will only represents a threat when it is ambiguous, manipulated, or imposed upon as a means of forcing conformity. Under the right conditions, the general will could give individuals more freedom and autonomy, not less, as citizens participate in shaping the society in which they live.

In conclusion, while Rousseau's concept of the general will aims to articulate a vision of democratic self-rule and advance the common good, it also poses risks to individual liberty that must be considered. Individuals should not be forced to submit to the will of the majority without consideration of minority rights and dissent. But if implemented properly, Rousseau's vision could point towards a future with both strong collective governance and strong protections for civil libertiesâ€”a future where individuals find freedom through participation in a self-governing society. Overall, the extent to which the general will threatens individual liberty depends on how it is defined, manifested, and institutionalized in practice.
