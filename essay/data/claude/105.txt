Here is a draft 2250 word essay in response to the prompt:

The English theatrical tradition underwent a radical transformation following the Restoration of the monarchy under Charles II in 1660. After years of Puritan rule that banned public theatre, the re-opening of playhouses spurred an efflorescence of new dramatic works that reflected both the political and social values of the age. In particular, Restoration comedies depicted contemporary society and manners through innovative and varied approaches. Playwrights employed either a satirical and subversive bent, or a sentimental and moralistic one, reflecting the cultural influences of French theatre as well as native English traditions.

The satirical Restoration comedies, following the example of Moliere’s biting social commentaries, took a cynical and irreverent view of the pretenses and hypocrisies of the upper classes. William Wycherley’s The Country Wife (1675) mocks  the foolishness of jealous husbands and the Puritanical codes of morality regarding sexuality. Its farcical plot turns on deception and disguise, where characters pursue their appetites without restraint or consequences. This subversive spirit is embodied in characters like Horner, who treats others’ pretensions and honour with derision. The play thus reflects the aristocratic English society where wit and pleasure were dominant, and old moral values were scorned.

In contrast, sentimental comedies incorporated moralistic messages and more sympathetic characters. Plays like Sir Richard Steele’s The Tender Husband (1705) move away from cynical satire in favour of upholding virtues like kindness, compassion, and moral rectitude. Steele creates dignified and tender-hearted characters like the protagonist Clerimont, who finds happiness through his own good nature and generosity. This moralistic spirit reflects the middle-class ideology of England at the turn of the century, where virtue and Christian values were championed.

The theatrical techniques in Restoration comedies were also influenced by French neoclassical drama, which emphasized elaborate set designs, stylized language, and physical comedy. However, English playwrights adapted these techniques to suit native comedic traditions as well as the intimate scale of London playhouses. While French plays privileged visual splendour and the three unities of time, place and action, English comedies focused on witty dialogue, farcical plot, and direct asides to the audience. These dramatic conventions allowed for more improvisation and spontaneity suited to the English milieu.

In conclusion, the period following the English Restoration produced new dramaturgical approaches that gave insights into the society of the age. Through satirical or sentimental tones, playwrights reflected the dominant values and manners of the aristocracy and middle class respectively. While French neoclassical theatre provided an initial model, English playwrights tailored dramatic techniques and conventions to reflect native traditions as well. As a result, Restoration comedies offer a glimpse into the diverging cultural ideologies that made up this pivotal time in England’s history.
