Here is a draft 2250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Over the past few decades, China has experienced a meteoric rise in its economic growth and technological development, resulting in China becoming one of the world's most significant global political and economic powers. China's rise has significant implications for the global order, with both concerns about a potential "China Threat" and arguments in favor of China's "Peaceful Rise" gaining salience. 

China's rise is reshaping global economics and trade, with China increasingly influencing global supply chains and investments around the world through its Belt and Road Initiative. China has leveraged its economic clout to gain political and diplomatic influence on the global stage. There are concerns that China aims to reshape the global order and international institutions like the United Nations to better suit China's interests and values. Some argue this could undermine the influence of Western liberal democracies. However, others counter that China's rise could provide new opportunities for cooperation and strengthen international institutions if China is integrated responsibly.

Regionally, China's rise has made it the dominant political and economic power in East Asia. China is increasingly asserting its control over the South China Sea, building artificial islands and confronting its neighbors. There are concerns China aims to undermine US alliances and influence in the region to establish its own sphere of influence. However, others argue China primarily seeks to protect its own interests, and its actions are defensive rather than aggressive. China's rise could also provide economic opportunities for its neighbors if peaceful relations are maintained.

The "China Threat" theory argues that as China becomes more powerful, it will seek to challenge the Western-dominated global order and regional influence of the US to establish global hegemony. Proponents argue China holds values that differ from Western liberal democracies on issues like human rights, and as it gains influence, it may undermine global norms and alliances. However, the "Peaceful Rise of China" theory counters that China's rise can be benign if China is integrated into the existing global order. China primarily seeks to develop economically and technologically, not militarily, and would gain more benefits from a peaceful global and regional environment. 

In conclusion, China's rise as a global superpower has geopolitical implications that foster both opportunities and challenges. There are reasonable arguments on both sides of the debate around the "China Threat" and "Peaceful Rise of China" theories. The future of China's rise may depend on maintaining mutually cooperative relations between China and the Western world to build trust and shared interests in a prosperous and stable global order. Overall, China's role as a global and regional power should not be underestimated, but confrontation is not inevitable if all parties pursue understanding and strategic cooperation.
