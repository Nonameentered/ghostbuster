Nietzsche's critique of religion and the "Death of God" lie at the core of his philosophy. For Nietzsche, religion represented everything that restricts and limits human flourishing. He believed that humanity is now navigating towards an epoch in which people realize religion is merely a human invention and has no objective truth or authority. This realization is what he refers to as the “Death of God.” 

Nietzsche saw religion as a barrier to free thought and action. He believed religious doctrines exert power over people by making them feel guilty about their natural instincts and desires. Religions convince people there are universal moral rules and codes of conduct, but Nietzsche argued that morality is relative and changes over time based on human needs and interests. In his view, religious morality limits human potential and creativity. 

The Death of God represents the possibility of freedom from these kinds of restrictions on human nature. Without God judging right and wrong, humans are free to determine values and meaning for themselves. They can embrace life and human passions without guilt. However, it also leads to a kind of existential angst as humans have to grapple with a lack of absolute meaning or purpose. Nietzsche believed this angst could be overcome by cultivating a strong, independent will to power and by realizing one’s full creative potential.

Nietzsche was particularly interested in the Greek god Dionysus as a life-affirming symbol. Dionysus represented passion, ecstasy, music, and dance - embracing life without restraint. Nietzsche admired the Greek celebration of human physicality and sexuality as represented by Dionysus. This stands in contrast with Christianity's emphasis on restraint, humility, and avoidance of worldly pleasures. For Nietzsche, Dionysian ideals were a prototype for how human nature could be freely expressed without religious moral constraints.

There is no doubt Nietzsche’s illness and experiences influenced his thinking. He suffered debilitating migraines and sickness during his most philosophically productive years. His suffering and confrontations with human weakness and mortality likely contributed to his interest in vitality, strength, and living fully while overcoming hardship. His atheism and radical individualism were a reaction against the weakness and herd-mentality he saw in religious pietism. However, his unique life experiences also gave him a kind of solitude and independence to develop such an uncompromising philosophy.

In conclusion, Nietzsche's critique of religion and concept of the Death of God represent a pivotal moment in Western thought. By declaring God dead, Nietzsche sought to free humanity from belief in absolute moral truth and external purpose so that individuals could determine meaning and values for themselves. His philosophy promoted radical individualism, creativity, passion, and living life to the fullest unencumbered by guilt or morality. For Nietzsche, the Death of God was a necessary step for humankind to reach its highest potential. Overall, Nietzsche's atheism and philosophy of self-mastery have had an enormous influence on subsequent thinkers in fields ranging from existentialism to postmodernism.
