Chest pain on the right side can indicate several conditions that affect the lungs, pleura, or other structures in that area of the chest. The pleura are thin membranes that line the outside of the lungs and the inner chest wall. Pleural effusion refers to the buildup of fluid between these two layers of pleura. This excess fluid can put pressure on the lungs and cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms. There are several potential causes of right-sided chest pain and pleural effusion that require diagnosis and treatment.

Some of the potential causes of chest pain and pleural effusion on the right side include pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, and liver disease. Pneumonia, an infection of the tiny air sacs in the lungs, can lead to inflammation and fluid buildup around the lungs. Pulmonary embolism refers to a blood clot in the lungs, which can also cause chest pain and pleural effusion. Heart failure, where the heart muscle is weakened and unable to pump blood effectively, may lead to fluid backup that seeps into the pleural space. Advanced liver disease, such as cirrhosis, can also cause fluid retention and buildup in the chest.

To diagnose the underlying cause of symptoms, doctors will review the patient's medical history and conduct a physical exam. Diagnostic tests like chest x-rays, computed tomography or CT scans, blood tests, and pleural fluid analysis are often ordered. A chest x-ray can detect pleural effusion and other lung or heart problems. CT scans provide a more detailed view of the chest structures. Blood tests check for signs of infection or other conditions like heart failure or liver disease. Analysis of the pleural fluid itself can determine if there are abnormal cells or high levels of certain proteins that point to specific conditions.

Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause of the symptoms. For pneumonia, antibiotics and rest are usually prescribed. A pulmonary embolism is treated with blood thinners and oxygen therapy. For heart failure, diuretics to reduce fluid overload and other medications are used. Treatment of liver disease and cirrhosis may include medications, lifestyle changes, or in severe cases a liver transplant. To relieve pressure and pain from pleural effusion, a procedure called thoracentesis is often performed to drain the excess fluid. In some cases, a chest tube or pleurodesis may be required to prevent fluid from returning.  

In summary, right-sided chest pain and pleural effusion have several possible causes that require proper diagnosis and treatment. Causes include pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, liver disease, and other conditions affecting the lungs or pleura. Diagnostic tests and analysis of pleural fluid can determine the underlying cause. Treatment focuses on targeted therapies for the specific condition, as well as draining excess pleural fluid for symptom relief. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis for most causes can be good.
