The aim of this experiment was to analyze the chemical composition of a commercially available alcoholic cider, Strongbow, using gas chromatography. Gas chromatography is a technique that separates the chemical compounds in a mixture and identifies them based on their interaction with a stationary phase in a column.

To analyze the Strongbow cider, a calibration curve needed to be established using standard solutions of known alcohol concentrations. Ethanol standards were prepared at 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% v/v by diluting 100% ethanol with deionized water. These standards were used to calibrate the gas chromatograph and create a line of best fit to determine the ethanol concentration of the cider sample. 

A Strongbow cider sample of 100 μL was also prepared by diluting 1 part cider with 4 parts deionized water. Both the standards and the sample were placed in GC vials for analysis. The equipment used was an Agilent Technologies 6890N Network gas chromatograph with flame ionization detection. The column used was a non-polar EC-Wax column to separate the volatile organic compounds in the sample.Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 5 mL/min. The inlet temperature was 200°C and the detector temperature was 250°C. The oven temperature program started at 40°C, held for 6 minutes, then ramped up at 4°C/min up to a final temperature of 110°C, with a hold time of 5 minutes. 

Based on the retention time and peak area, the ethanol concentration of the Strongbow cider sample was determined to be 4.8% v/v, or 9.6 proof. The chromatogram showed one major peak for ethanol with few other trace volatile compounds. Based on the label, the alcohol content of Strongbow cider is 4.5% v/v, so the result from the gas chromatography analysis was in good agreement.

Some potential sources of error include baseline drift, improper calibration of instruments, and difficulty separating compounds with similar retention times. Using proper maintenance and calibration procedures as well as optimized temperature programs can help minimize baseline drift and ensure instrument calibration. Selecting a column with good selectivity for the target compounds will produce clear resolution of adjacent peaks.

In summary, gas chromatography with flame ionization detection was successfully used to analyze a sample of Strongbow cider to determine its ethanol concentration. By diluting both standards and a sample, preparing calibration curves, and optimizing gas chromatograph parameters, this analysis yielded a result consistent with the product label, demonstrating the efficacy of this technique for food and beverage analysis. Overall, the aim of the experiment was achieved by identifying the presence and concentration of ethanol in the commercial cider sample.
