Public key infrastructure (PKI) is a fundamental framework that enables secure wireless networks and data exchange. It relies on public key cryptography (PKC) to establish trust and ensure the privacy and integrity of communications. The most commonly used PKC algorithm is RSA, named after its inventors Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman. 

PKI works by using a pair of cryptographic keys – a public key and a private key – to encrypt and decrypt data. The public key can be shared with anyone and is used to encrypt data that only the private key holder can decrypt. The private key is kept secret and is used to digitally sign messages to verify the sender's identity. This asymmetrical encryption scheme allows two parties to securely communicate over an insecure network like the internet.

To enable widespread use of PKC, PKI establishes a hierarchy of digital certificates that bind public keys to identities. Certificate authorities (CAs) at the top of the hierarchy issue and sign certificates for lower-level CAs and end users. A CA will only issue a certificate after verifying the recipient's identity. The CA's digital signature on a certificate allows others to verify that the public key in the certificate belongs to a specific person or device.

PKI is used to secure communications for technologies like virtual private networks (VPNs), Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS), and Wi-Fi networks. For example, to connect to a Wi-Fi network, a user enters a passphrase which is used to decrypt the network's public key. The user's device then generates a random symmetric key to encrypt communications with the network. The network's private key is required to decrypt that symmetric key, ensuring only authorized devices can join the network.

Digital signatures are a key use of PKI that provide integrity and non-repudiation. To digitally sign a document, the sender feeds the document through a hash function to generate a message digest, which is a unique fingerprint of the data. The sender then encrypts the message digest with their private key. Anyone with the sender's public key can decrypt the message digest. By comparing it to a new message digest generated from the received document, the recipient can verify that the document hasn't been altered since being signed. They can also verify the sender's identity since only the legitimate private key holder could have encrypted the message digest. 

The RSA algorithm is the most common PKC algorithm, used for both encryption and digital signatures. It involves generating a large integer from two prime numbers, called the modulus. The private key consists of those two prime numbers. The public key contains the modulus and a third number called the exponent.

To encrypt a message, the sender represents the message as an integer and uses the recipient's public key (modulus and exponent) to compute a corresponding ciphertext integer. Decryption involves using the recipient's private key (the two prime numbers) to recover the original message integer. Because figuring out the prime factors of a large integer is very difficult, the RSA algorithm provides a high degree of security.

In summary, PKI enables many secure technologies and applications by providing encryption, authentication, and digital signature services based on PKC algorithms like RSA. By issuing trusted digital certificates, PKI allows people and devices to verify each other's identities and exchange information over networks with confidence that their communication is kept private and their data is intact. PKI will continue to be fundamental infrastructure supporting our increasingly digital and connected society.
