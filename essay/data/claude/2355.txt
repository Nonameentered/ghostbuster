Micro-morphological analysis examines microscopic traces, micro-stratigraphic features, and microscopic residues preserved within occupational deposits and sediments to provide insight into the socio-cultural and environmental dynamics of ancient settlements and landscapes. By analyzing the properties and spatial relationships between materials at the microscopic scale, micro-morphological analysis can provide a high-resolution perspective on site formation processes, spatial organization, and changes over time that complements evidence from excavation and artifact analysis.  

The principal contribution of micro-morphological analysis is that it enables the study of occupational deposits, materials, and sediments at a microscopic scale, providing a detailed record of spatial relationships, chronological sequences, and micro-environmental conditions that shape site formation. By documenting the position, orientation, and contacts between materials, paintings, artifacts, bioarchaeological remains, and architectural materials at a microscopic scale, micro-morphological analysis provides insight into how these components were deposited and their spatio-temporal relationships. This in turn provides clues into routine practices, uses of space, and changes over time.

Microscopic analysis of micro-stratigraphic sequences and micro-residues within occupation deposits can identify patterns of accumulation and changes that signal routine and exceptional events.  The properties of micro-stratigraphic sequences, including orientation, texture, and inclusions, can indicate the source and depositional process of sediments. Spatial relationships between micro-stratigraphic units point to continuity or changes in use of space.  Micro-residues like phytoliths, pollen, and starch grains provide direct evidence of activities like cooking, craft production, and agriculture. Changes or anomalies in these micro-remains may signal exceptional events like abandonment, rebuilding, or changes in environment or economy.  

By examining the spatial organization and relationships between materials, micro-morphological analysis contributes to understanding the complex uses of space within buildings and settlements.  The dispersal and clustering of paintings, artifacts, ecofacts, and architectural materials at a microscopic scale provides clues to how spaces were used, divided, and transitioned between over time.  Relationships between areas of domestic, ritual, and economic activities can be identified from the microscopic properties of materials and their distribution. Changes over time in these spatial patterns can indicate transitions in the use, organization, and meaning of spaces.

In summary, micro-morphological analysis of occupational deposits provides a microscopic perspective on the sociocultural and environmental dynamics of ancient sites. By documenting the properties, spatial relationships, and chronological sequences of materials at a microscopic scale, micro-morphological analysis enables insight into site formation processes, the use and transition of spaces, routine and exceptional events, and relationships between domestic, ritual, and economic activities that shape settlements and landscapes over time. This approach complements evidence from excavation and artifacts, providing a detailed record of the complex spatial organization and changes within buildings, settlements, and their environments.
