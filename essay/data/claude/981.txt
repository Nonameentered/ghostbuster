Jean-Jacques Rousseau's social contract theory proposes that by submitting our individual freedom to the authority of the state, we can achieve a greater and more meaningful freedom as citizens. However, there are inherent tensions in this view, as individuals must sacrifice some degree of personal freedom and autonomy to the general will of the community. 

Rousseau argues that the natural state of human existence is one of total freedom and independence. However, this natural freedom also leaves humans in a state of vulnerability, fear, and “continual independence”. To achieve security and protection, humans enter into a social contract, whereby they sacrifice their unrestricted freedom in exchange for civil freedom and rights within a political community. Under the social contract, individuals unite to form a sovereign body, the general will of the people, which is designed to promote the common good. By submitting to the general will, individuals can achieve moral and civil freedom, defined as willing obedience to self-given laws that promote the public interest.

However, this conception of freedom poses certain challenges. In giving up our natural independence to the state, individuals risk the possibility of a tyrannical sovereign who does not respect civil liberties and freedoms. Rousseau argues that the sovereign power should be exercised directly by all citizens through an active and participatory process. But in large, complex societies, it may be difficult to determine and implement the general will. Representatives or governments could easily abuse their power and authority, threatening the freedom of citizens. There is also a risk that particular wills and interest groups may dominate over the general will, undermining the common good.

Rousseau proposes a number of solutions to address these issues, including maintaining small states, active civic participation, censorship of dissenting opinions, and a civil religion to reinforce social bonds. However, these solutions raise their own issues, especially concerning individual diversity of belief and the limitation of expression. There are also criticisms that Rousseau's conception of the general will is contradictory or even repressive. His ideas of forcing individuals to be free in the way he defines freedom undermine the liberal principles of diversity and pluralism.

In conclusion, while Rousseau's social contract aims to achieve civil freedom and security through the expression of the general will, there are a number of inherent tensions and contradictions in his theory. His view of freedom is limited by the need to submit individual judgement and autonomy to the authority of the state. Achieving the common good requires restricting particular interests, but this poses risks to diversity of thought and belief. Overall, the social contract as envisioned by Rousseau provides an imperfect solution to achieving individual freedom and communal unity. His theory raises as many questions as it aims to answer regarding the complex relationship between the freedom of the individual and the obligations of citizenship.
