The European Commission occupies an ambiguous position in the EU's institutional structure, exhibiting characteristics of both a government bureaucracy and an executive policymaking body. On the one hand, it employs over 32,000 civil servants tasked with administrative and regulatory functions that enable the functioning of the single market and support intergovernmental politics. In this sense, it acts as the administrative arm of the Council and member states. On the other hand, the Commission holds significant policymaking power and autonomy as the "guardian of the treaties" that proposes EU legislation and spearheads policy initiatives. While the Council and Parliament make final decisions, the Commission plays a central role in defining and advancing European integration.

The Commission's bureaucratic functions are evident in its responsibility for implementing EU policies and budgets. It manages programs, distributes funds, enforces rules, and collects data to support the internal market. However, the Commission is more than just a passive administrator. It has the sole right of legislative initiative in most policy areas and proposes draft laws and policies that shape the EU's agenda. Though the Council and Parliament can amend or reject proposals, the Commission is instrumental in setting priorities and framing debates. Its five-year policy programs and annual work plans drive the EU's legislative timetable and negotiations. 

The Commission also exhibits a government-like executive role as it oversees the application of EU law across member states and represents the EU internationally as a single negotiating body. It enforces compliance with treaties, investigates violations, and refers cases to the Court of Justice. On foreign policy and trade issues, the Commission negotiates on behalf of the EU and concludes international agreements that bind member states. However, its executive powers are limited since the Council controls foreign policy and several commissioners represent national interests.

There are tensions between the Commission's supranational aspirations and its reliance on member states. While aiming to serve the EU's collective interests, the Commission remains dependent on member state governments that appoint commissioners and set legislative policies. National interests and loyalties often permeate commissioners' decisions, constraining the Commission's autonomy. However, its powers of initiative and guardianship of the treaties allow it to push for deeper integration at times, especially when political will exists. 

In conclusion, the Commission exhibits a dual identity as both a bureaucratic arm of member state governments and a supranational policymaking executive in the EU. Its powers and functions place it between intergovernmental and supranational paradigms of European governance. While the overall balance of power rests with member states, the Commission's role as an initiator and guardian of integration affords it latitude to drive the EU in new directions during windows of opportunity. Its position at the nexus of national and supranational interests also means that its actions will continue to shape debates over the democratic legitimacy and frontiers of the European project.
