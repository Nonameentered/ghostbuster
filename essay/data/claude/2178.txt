Plant morphology, including the size, shape, texture, and form of plant organs and tissues, is crucially dependent on genetics. The specific genes present in a plant genome ultimately determine how it develops and grows. By understanding the genetic basis of morphological traits in plants, scientists can identify ways to breed and engineer crops with improved morphology and enhanced agricultural productivity.  

Three papers that investigate how specific genes influence plant morphology are: 

1) Mutations in the GA20ox1 of Brassica napus cause delayed flowering by reducing the expression of floral integrators by Gai-Ler et al. (2019). This study examines how mutations in the GA20ox1 gene, which encodes an important enzyme in the gibberellic acid biosynthesis pathway, lead to delayed flowering in canola plants. Gibberellic acid promotes flowering by upregulating downstream genes known as floral integrators, and the GA20ox1 mutations cause slower accumulation of these integrators, resulting in later flowering. By understanding this genetic mechanism controlling flowering time, breeders can develop canola varieties that flower at optimal times.

2) EARLY BOLTING IN SHORT DAYS controls flowering time in Brassica rapa through regulation of CONSTANS gene expression by Luo et al. (2019). This paper analyzes how natural allelic variation in the EBISD gene leads to differences in flowering time in Chinese cabbage. EBISD regulates expression of the CONSTANS gene, which triggers flowering in response to long days in many plant species. Certain alleles of EBISD are associated with decreased expression of CONSTANS and delayed flowering, while other alleles increase CONSTANS expression and promote early flowering. Breeders can use EBISD alleles to ensure Chinese cabbage varieties are well-matched to target growing regions. 

3) A tandem gene duplication gave rise to flooded cells capable of oxygen release in plant roots by Larsen et al. (2019). This research found that a gene duplication in the common ancestor of wetland plants produced two homologous genes called RCT1 and PUP1. RCT1 helps root cells accommodate flooding stress, while PUP1 enables roots to release oxygen into waterlogged soils. Together, these genes have allowed wetland plants to adapt to flooded habitats. Agricultural scientists could potentially use RCT1 and PUP1 to engineer crop plants better able to tolerate flooding, an increasing threat with climate change.

In summary, genetics plays a crucial role in determining plant morphology and phenology. By understanding flowering control pathways involving GA20ox1/gibberellic acid, EBISD/CONSTANS, and other mechanisms, scientists gain insights into how to breeding crops with enhanced yield through improved flowering times and other traits. Genes like RCT1 and PUP1 also offer opportunities for engineering plants that can withstand stresses such as flooding. Continued investigation of the genetic underpinnings of plant development will enable further innovations in crop improvement for agriculture.
