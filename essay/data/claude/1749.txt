The anti-war pacifist position holds that all violence and war are immoral and should be opposed and avoided. The main philosophical rival to pacifism is the just war theory, which holds that wars can be morally justified under certain conditions, such as self-defence or humanitarian intervention. Just war theorists make several criticisms against pacifism that pacifists must respond to. 

One key criticism is that pacifism denies the right of self-defence held by individuals and political communities. Just war theorists argue that if individuals have a right to use violence in self-defence when attacked, this right should extend to states defending themselves. Pacifists counter that there are important differences between individual and state use of force. Individual self-defence uses the minimum force necessary to deter an attacker, whereas state military action often escalates violence and causes tremendous harm. Pacifists also argue that political communities have non-violent ways to defend themselves, through diplomacy, sanctions, and international pressure. These options should be exhausted before states claim a right to military self-defence.

Another criticism of pacifism is that it permits human rights violations and humanitarian crises to continue unchecked. Just war theorists argue that military intervention is needed in countries that fail to protect human rights or are engaged in genocide. Pacifists counter that military intervention often does more harm than good, through loss of life and damage to infrastructure. It also undermines principles of state sovereignty and non-interference. Pacifists argue that non-violent interventions like diplomacy, sanctions, and peacekeeping forces are better ways to prevent human rights abuses. If intervention is needed, it should be a last resort, approved by the international community, limited in scope, and aimed at civilian protection.

Critics argue that pacifism offers no viable alternatives to armed conflict, but pacifists counter that non-violent alternatives can be very effective. Diplomacy and negotiation can resolve conflicts and deter aggression. Sanctions and boycotts can pressure states into changing harmful policies. Peacekeeping forces and unarmed civilian protection can prevent violence against civilians. And nonviolent civil resistance, like protests, strikes, and sit-ins can be used to enact political change without violence. These strategies have been used successfully in places like India, South Africa, and Egypt to overturn unjust systems of authority.

Finally, pacifists argue against the presumption that society has in favour of military action and war. States often rush to war without considering non-violent options. But violence should not be the default response, as it frequently escalates conflicts, has tremendous costs, and undermines human rights and dignity. Pacifists argue that peaceful solutions should always be attempted first, and propose that non-violent interventions and conflict prevention become the default approach for resolving global issues. Military action should only ever be used as an absolute last resort in extreme circumstances.

In conclusion, while just war theory poses some reasonable criticisms of pacifism, pacifists are able to provide persuasive counterarguments and point to peaceful alternatives that should be attempted before states claim military action is necessary or just. Pacifism deserves more consideration as a morally sound approach to global politics in today's world.
