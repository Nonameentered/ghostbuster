Latin America has a long history of US intervention in the region, spanning at least two centuries. However, in recent decades, Latin American nations have become increasingly willing and able to resist US intervention. Several factors have contributed to this trend.

First, the end of the Cold War removed the ideological imperative for the US to intervene in Latin America to counter Soviet influence. During the Cold War, the US frequently intervened, overtly and covertly, in Latin American nations to prop up anti-communist leaders and groups. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, this motivation for intervention disappeared. Latin American leaders no longer had to choose between the US and USSR, and the US no longer saw leftist movements in the region as threats to its strategic interests. This gave Latin American nations more autonomy and freedom from US control.

Second, the rise of regional alliances and cooperation has made Latin American nations less dependent on the US and more able to present a unified front. For example, the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) have increased cooperation on political and economic issues. When the US criticizes or intervenes in one Latin American country, the others can provide diplomatic support. Regional alliances also facilitate cooperation on infrastructure, trade, and political issues, diversifying Latin American economies and political relationships beyond the US.

Third, the emergence of left-wing and populist leaders in Latin America has produced leaders less willing to follow US directives. Leaders like Hugo Ch√°vez in Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia, and Rafael Correa in Ecuador rejected the neoliberal economic model favored by the US and spoke out strongly against US intervention, especially on the issue of the War on Drugs. They built their political legitimacy partly by opposing US influence, providing an ideological counter to US hegemony. While the "Pink Tide" of left-wing leaders has receded recently, they helped build popular support for resisting US overreach.   

In conclusion, the end of the Cold War, the rise of regional cooperation, and the emergence of left-wing leaders have all contributed to Latin America's growing confidence in opposing US intervention. Though the US remains influential, Latin America is now composed of strong, independent nations willing to defend their sovereignty - a significant change from the 20th century. The era of unchecked US intervention in Latin America appears to be over. Latin Americans want to chart their own course, not have it dictated to them by their northern neighbor.
