The Kjeldahl method is a quantitative analytical technique used to determine the amount of nitrogen and hence, protein in foods and other materials. It involves a three-step process: digestion, distillation, and titration. First, a sample is digested in sulfuric acid, which breaks down the nitrogen into ammonium sulfate. Then, the mixture is distilled, which separates the ammonia into a receiving solution. Finally, the amount of ammonia is determined by titrating the receiving solution with a standard acid. 

The Kjeldahl method is useful for determining protein content because nitrogen is a key component of amino acids and proteins. By measuring the nitrogen, one can calculate the protein content. The method works by breaking down the sample into its constituent parts in the digestion step. The sulfuric acid digests the material and converts any nitrogen into ammonium sulfate. The distillation step involves boiling the digested sample and capturing the released ammonia gas into a receiving solution like boric acid. The ammonia can then be quantified in the titration step using a standardized acid to determine the original nitrogen content in the sample.

There are a few potential sources of error in the Kjeldahl method. If the digestion is incomplete, not all the nitrogen will be converted into ammonium sulfate, leading to an underestimation of protein. It is also possible to lose some ammonia during the distillation process if there are leaks in the apparatus or if the distillation time is too long, also causing an underestimation. Using an inaccurate titrant or performing the titration incorrectly can also introduce error. To minimize error, proper technique and functioning equipment are required.

Protein content is important in breadmaking because it influences dough properties and the final loaf volume and structure. Flour with a higher protein content, called "strong flour," produces more gluten. Gluten is the stretchy protein network formed when wheat flour is mixed with water. More gluten leads to a greater gas retention in the dough, allowing for better leavening and a bigger loaf volume. However, too much gluten can make the finished bread tough and chewy. Flour with lower protein, "weak" flour, produces bread with opposite effects. For most breads, a balance of wheat flours with different protein levels are combined to achieve ideal gluten formation and loaf characteristics.  

In summary, the Kjeldahl method is a classic technique used to determine nitrogen and protein content. By digesting, distilling, and titrating a sample, one can quantify its nitrogen content and calculate protein content. The method is useful but subject to several possible errors if not performed properly. Protein content in flour has a major effect on breadmaking by influencing dough properties and loaf characteristics. By using different flours with varying protein levels, bread can be optimized.
