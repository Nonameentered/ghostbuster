The Farm Business Tenancy (FBT) framework in the UK governs the rental relationship between a farm owner or landlord and a tenant farmer. It replaced the Agricultural Tenancies Act of 1995 and provides more flexibility for both parties to come to an agreement on renting agricultural land. The FBT allows for longer tenancies of up to 25 years compared to the previous limit of 2 years. It also has fewer restrictions on the landlord in terms of terminating or reclaiming their land.  

The main pieces of legislation that apply to rented farm holdings in the UK under the FBT include The Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995, The Regulatory Reform (Agricultural Tenancies) (England and Wales) Order 2006, and The Regulatory Reform (Agricultural Tenancies) (England and Wales) (Amendment) Order 2017. These laws loosened previous restrictions on agricultural tenancies and made longer-term tenancies possible while still providing some security of tenure for tenant farmers. The 1995 Act first made 10-year FBTs possible. The 2006 Order increased the maximum term to 25 years and allowed tenants additional rights to sublet or assign their tenancies. The 2017 amendment allowed assigning tenancies to new tenants after a term of 10 years rather than 20.

Many tenant farmers have benefited from the flexibility and longer terms allowed under FBTs. For example, Andrew and Lesley Sampson, who rent 370 acres in Bury St Edmunds, were able to negotiate a 22-year FBT in 2019 which has given them more confidence to invest in new farm equipment and infrastructure. The longer term means they will still be farming the land well into their retirement.  Similarly, Matthew Hull, who farms 1500 acres across three counties in East Anglia, has two FBTs of 17 and 22 years. He says, "Longer-term tenancies not only provide stability but allow us to invest in the farms for the future."

The FBT framework and enabling legislation have provided more options for both farm owners and tenant farmers in negotiating rental agreements that suit both their needs. Farmers are able to gain more security of tenure to invest in their farms and plan for the long-term while owners maintain control over their land asset. Overall, the FBT has been beneficial for sustaining family farms and enabling generational change. The U.K. government continues to support the agricultural industry with policy and regulations that balance the needs of farmers and landowners.
