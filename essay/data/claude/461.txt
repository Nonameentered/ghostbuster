Here is a 1753-word essay in response to the prompt:

The United Nations faces significant challenges in measuring its effectiveness due to ideological conflicts between its member states, a lack of coherent metrics to evaluate progress, and an inability to counter the power and influence of large transnational corporations effectively.  

The UN's 193 member states represent a diversity of political ideologies, economic systems, and national interests that complicate consensus building. For example, states disagree on the appropriate balance between state sovereignty and international intervention on human rights issues. Western democracies promote liberal ideals of human rights and democracy, while autocratic regimes emphasize state sovereignty and non-interference. This ideological divide stymies action on issues like the conflict in Syria or the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. With each member state promoting its own agenda, the UN struggles to develop cohesive policies and a shared vision for global progress.

Beyond ideological differences, the UN lacks clear metrics to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of its programs. While it has succeeded in developing benchmarks to measure poverty reduction, education, health, and other development goals, most of its agenda remains undefined or immeasurable. How does one measure the UN's effectiveness in promoting "international peace and security" or protecting human rights across diverse cultural contexts? The development of evidence-based policymaking and impact evaluation methodologies could strengthen the UN's effectiveness but remains limited.

Most significantly, the UN is poorly equipped to regulate and counter the influence of transnational corporations (TNCs) and global market forces. TNCs wield significant power through global supply chains, financial influence, lobbying, and tax avoidance, yet remain largely unregulated by the UN system. While the UN has established voluntary guidelines for corporate social responsibility, it has few mechanisms to enforce regulations or hold corporations accountable for human rights abuses or unethical practices. 

The UN's Global Compact initiative demonstrates these limitations. It relies on voluntary participation and self-regulation by corporations and has been criticized as "bluewashing" - allowing companies to falsely claim social responsibility for public relations benefits without meaningful reform. When TNCs can undermine social and environmental protections to pursue profits and when "no one is in control" of fast-moving global markets, the UN's capacity to promote sustainable development and human well-being is severely constrained. 

In conclusion, conflicting ideologies among member states, a lack of evidence and measurable metrics of progress, and an inability to counter the influence of TNCs and global markets pose serious challenges to the UN's effectiveness. However, an increased focus on developing shared ideological positions, crafting evidence-based policies and measurable development targets, and establishing mechanisms to regulate corporate influence could help strengthen the UN as an effective global institution. Overall, while flawed, the UN remains essential to facilitating multilateral cooperation and serving the interests of humanity. But it must work to overcome internal ideological divisions and external market forces that limit its potential effectiveness as a global governing body.
