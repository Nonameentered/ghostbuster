Here is a draft essay in 1000 words on the money multiplier and monetary policy:

The money multiplier refers to the phenomenon whereby banks can "create" money through lending that is a multiple of their reserves. When banks make loans to customers, they are effectively creating new deposits in the banking system that represent spendable money. The money multiplier arises due to the fact that the initial deposits are not retained in full as cash reserves by the banks. Instead, most of the deposit is lent out again, which creates new deposits in the banking system, which are then lent out again, and so on. 

The process begins when someone deposits cash in a bank. The bank will keep only a fraction of the deposit as reserves based on a "reserve requirement" set by the central bank. The rest of the deposit can be lent out to another customer, who then spends it and deposits it in another bank. This new deposit again has only a fraction kept in reserve, allowing the rest to be lent out. This process continues, with the initial deposit being multiplied through successive rounds of lending and redepositing. The money multiplier is calculated as the reciprocal of the reserve ratio, meaning the lower the reserve ratio, the higher the money multiplier.

Banks thus create "broad money" (bank deposits) that is a multiple of the initial "base money" (physical currency and bank reserves) in circulation. This expansion of the money supply through bank lending has a positive impact on economic growth by providing more funding for businesses and households to invest and spend. However, if the money supply grows too quickly, it can lead to higher inflation. 

Central banks can regulate the money multiplier and control the growth of money and credit by adjusting the reserve requirements for commercial banks. Increasing reserve requirements lowers the money multiplier by forcing banks to hold a larger share of deposits as reserves. This slows down the expansion of lending and deposits. Lowering reserve requirements has the opposite effect, increasing the pace of lending and deposit growth in the banking system.

In summary, the money multiplier arises from the lending activity of commercial banks and their ability to create broad money in the economy based on a multiplier of reserves. By setting mandatory reserve ratios, central banks can directly influence the money multiplier and regulate the overall expansion of money and credit to balance economic growth with price stability. Adjusting reserve requirements is thus an important instrument of monetary policy for central banks.
