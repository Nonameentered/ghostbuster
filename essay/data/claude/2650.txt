The aim of the experiment was to determine the concentration of an unknown copper solution using electrochemical methods of analysis, specifically through the use of a galvanic cell. A galvanic cell consists of two half cells, an anode and a cathode, that generate an electric potential difference due to the redox reactions occurring at each electrode. When the electrodes are connected via a salt bridge, this allows ions to flow between them and generate a potential difference that can be measured. 

The potential difference of a galvanic cell depends on the concentrations of ions in each half cell according to the Nernst equation. By creating a series of solutions with known concentrations, a calibration plot can be constructed to relate concentration and potential difference. The concentration of the unknown sample can then be determined using its measured potential difference and the calibration plot.

To carry out the experiment, a series of standard solutions were first prepared at concentrations of 0.01 M, 0.05 M, 0.10 M and 1.0 M from a stock solution of 1.0 M copper sulfate. The anode half cell contained the standard or unknown solution while the cathode contained a 1.0 M copper sulfate solution. Potential differences were measured for each standard solution using a voltmeter.

A calibration plot was then constructed with concentration on the x-axis and potential difference on the y-axis. From the trendline equation, the concentration of the unknown solution could be determined using its measured potential difference. For the unknown solution measured in the experiment, a potential difference of 0.301 V was recorded. From the trendline equation, this corresponds to a concentration of 0.0769 M.

In summary, the aim of determining an unknown concentration using electrochemical methods was achieved through the combination of galvanic cells to generate potential differences and calibration plots relating these differences to known concentrations. The experiment demonstrated their usefulness as a quantitative analytical technique for solution analysis.
