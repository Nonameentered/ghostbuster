The aim of the experiment comparing platinum film and thermistor resistance thermometers was to determine which type of thermometer was more accurate and precise over a temperature range of interest for many chemical and industrial processes. Platinum film resistance thermometers operate based on the principle that electrical resistance of metals like platinum increases with increasing temperature in a linear and precise fashion. Thermistor resistance thermometers utilize semiconductor materials whose resistance decreases nonlinearly with increasing temperature. 

The experimental methodology involved placing multiple platinum film and thermistor resistance thermometers in a temperature-controlled bath and taking resistance measurements at intervals as the temperature was increased in a stepwise manner. For the platinum film thermometers, it was expected that resistance would increase linearly with temperature based on the well-known temperature coefficient of resistance for platinum. For the thermistors, the resistance-temperature relationship follows an exponential curve that needed to be determined experimentally.

At each temperature interval, multiple measurements were taken with each thermometer to determine not only accuracy relative to the standard temperature of the bath but also the precision of each thermometer based on how close the multiple measurements were to each other. The platinum film thermometers showed a high degree of precision with little variation in the resistance measured at each temperature. The thermistor resistance thermometers displayed decreasing resistance with increasing temperature as expected based on their physics, but the precision was lower, with more variability in the measurements at each temperature. 

 In terms of accuracy, the platinum film thermometers matched very closely to the known temperatures of the calibration bath. The thermistor resistance thermometers, while still quite accurate, showed some deviations from the expected resistance-temperature curve, indicating they were subject to more error and uncertainty relative to the platinum film thermometers.

In conclusion, the platinum film resistance thermometers proved superior to the thermistor resistance thermometers in both accuracy and precision over the range of temperatures studied. While thermistor thermometers can be useful for some applications where extreme sensitivity is needed, platinum film thermometers are better suited for applications requiring highly accurate and repeatable temperature measurements, such as in many chemical reactor and industrial contexts. For these reasons, platinum film resistance thermometers are commonly used as reference standards to calibrate other temperature sensors.
