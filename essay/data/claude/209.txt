Here is a 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

The primary goal of most firms in a capitalist market system is to maximize profits for their owners or shareholders. Profits represent the excess revenue from sales over the costs of production and distribution. Maximizing profits means earning as much revenue as possible while keeping costs as low as possible. This goal of profit maximization is fundamental for the survival of firms. If firms cannot make enough profit to cover their costs and provide a return for shareholders, they will eventually go out of business as they run out of money or lose access to financing. 

However, the relationship between profit maximization and survival becomes more complex in highly competitive markets. When there are many firms offering essentially the same product or service, it becomes difficult to raise prices and revenue without losing customers. Firms in a highly competitive market may have to accept very small profit margins to match the low prices of their competitors. They have to focus on maximizing efficiency and minimizing costs just to survive. Some may even engage in predatory pricing, temporarily dropping prices below costs to try and drive other competitors out of the market. Profit maximization in this case really means loss minimization, at least in the short term.

The profit maximization and survival dynamic also changes when there is a separation of ownership and control in firms. In large publicly traded companies, managers are in control of day-to-day operations but shareholders ultimately own the firm. Managers may be motivated to maximize their own compensation and job security rather than strictly maximize profits for dispersed shareholders. They may avoid risky strategies that could increase profits, choosing safer options that provide steady results. Or they may expand the size and scope of the firm through acquisitions and diversification in ways that benefit managers through higher pay and prestige but do not actually maximize returns for shareholders. 

In conclusion, while the ultimate goal of profit maximization is inextricably linked to the survival of most firms, the specific strategies and time horizons of maximization depend on the market and ownership context. Competitive and publicly traded firms often have more complex relationships between profits and survival than simple privately held firms with concentrated ownership. Profit maximization for long term survival may involve temporary loss minimization or managerial self-interest. But in the end, without making a profit, no firm can survive and provide value to its owners and society. Most firms will pursue whatever strategies necessary within their given constraints to achieve this objective.
