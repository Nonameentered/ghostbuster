Shakespeare's play Othello depicts the tragedy of Desdemona, a Venetian beauty who is wrongly accused of infidelity by her husband Othello. The play closely follows Aristotle's principles of tragedy, particularly in evoking emotions of pity and fear in the audience through Desdemona's misfortune. 

According to Aristotle, a tragic hero must be a virtuous and moral character who falls from fortune due to some error or frailty, known as the tragic flaw. Desdemona fits this definition. She is portrayed as a perfectly virtuous, gentle, and obedient wife who is blindly in love with Othello. Her only tragic flaw is her naivety and trust in Iago, who manipulates Othello into wrongly believing she has been unfaithful. This flaw, combined with the villainy of Iago and unfortunate circumstances, leads to her tragic fall.

Aristotle argues that for a work to be considered a tragedy, it must evoke feelings of pity and fear in the audience. The audience pities Desdemona because she is a blameless victim who suffers unjustly at the hands of her husband and Iago. Her physical and emotional anguish before her murder also evokes the audience's pity. At the same time, her suffering makes us fear the machinations of evil people like Iago and the precariousness of goodness in the world.

According to Aristotle, the tragic hero's misfortune must be caused by some mistake or frailty as well as manipulation of events by the gods. Similarly, Desdemona's downfall is a result not just of her naivety but also Iago's scheming, which can be seen as the work of malign forces conspiring against her. Iago is portrayed almost as a personification of evil, manipulating events and people to ruin Othello and Desdemona's happiness for his own ends. His sinister actions suggest the influence of cruel fate and supernatural forces working against the couple.

Aristotle argues that for the emotions of the tragedy to be most effective, the tragic hero should not be wholly good or bad but must have both desirable and undesirable traits so that the audience can identify with them. Similarly, while Desdemona is portrayed as virtuous, her willingness to marry Othello shows a small degree of rebelliousness against societal prejudices that makes her human and relatable. Her ultimate obedience to Othello also shows her vulnerability to manipulation by the patriarchal forces around her. This blend of virtue and human fallibility allows the audience to both revere and identify with Desdemona, making her tragedy especially poignant.

In conclusion, Desdemona's character and downfall closely follow Aristotle's principles of tragedy. She is a virtuous and relatable heroine who falls due to her own small flaw and the larger forces scheming against her. Her tragedy evokes the necessary tragic emotions of pity and fear in the audience, highlighting the precariousness of virtue in the world. Through Desdemona, Shakespeare created a memorable and quintessentially tragic heroine.
