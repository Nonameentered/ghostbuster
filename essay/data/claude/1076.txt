Discussing the concept of human rights requires questioning their existence and justification. Human rights are principles that uphold basic human dignity, but there are differing views on their origins and how they should be implemented. 

The most commonly cited basis for human rights is natural law, or the idea that rights are inherent to humanity and not granted by any authority. The 1948 United Nations Declaration of Human Rights declares that "recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world." According to this view, human rights arise from human nature and apply to all by virtue of being human. However, critics argue that there are no rights that can be derived solely from human nature without culturally-influenced value judgments. Rights may feel intuitively true but still depend on subjective moral reasoning.

An alternative view sees human rights as a social construct, arising from human relationships and responsibilities. From this perspective, life and any attendant rights are gifts from nature, parents, and society that shape how individuals should treat one another. However, framing rights as gifts suggests they can be given or taken away by gift-givers, rather than being inalienable. Rights would depend on what any given society considers a gift or responsibility worth upholding, risking relativity. 

To determine how human rights should be applied, we must consider the responsibilities of both society and individuals. Society has a responsibility to protect human rights and human dignity through its laws and policies. But individuals also have a responsibility to respect the rights of others in their community. Upholding rights is a cooperative effort that balances personal freedom and responsibility to others.

In conclusion, while human rights aim to protect human dignity, their origins and justification remain complex with reasonable arguments on multiple sides. There may be no universally-accepted basis for rights, but societies can work to uphold shared moral intuitions about how individuals should treat each other with care and respect. Protecting human rights ultimately requires the efforts of both social institutions and individual responsibility within a community. Overall, human rights rest not on any single theoretical justification but on the collective responsibility to defend human dignity.
