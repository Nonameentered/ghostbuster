Here is a draft 500-word essay in response to the prompt:

The most likely cause of Mr. X's symptoms of rectal bleeding, chronic constipation, and lower abdominal pain is colorectal cancer. Other differential diagnoses that should be considered include hemorrhoids, diverticulosis, and inflammatory bowel disease. To confirm a diagnosis of colorectal cancer, a physical examination should include a digital rectal exam to check for any masses or polyps, a stool test to check for blood, and a colonoscopy to directly visualize the colon.  

Receiving a diagnosis of colorectal cancer can have significant implications for Mr. X's psychosocial well-being. There may be anxiety and distress over the diagnosis and prognosis, especially given the life-threatening nature of colorectal cancer. Mr. X may require counseling and support groups to help cope with the emotional aspects of the diagnosis and treatment. There may also be concerns about the financial costs of treatment, time away from work during treatment, and ultimately adjusting to life as a cancer survivor. Close monitoring for recurrence and metastasis for several years can also take an emotional and psychological toll.

There are several debates surrounding colorectal cancer prevention and screening. While colonoscopy is considered the gold standard, there are debates over when and how often screening should begin and variations in quality and interpretation. Newer screening options like fecal immunochemical tests and CT colonography are less invasive but may miss some polyps. There are also debates over the costs and benefits of population-wide colorectal cancer screening programs. Some argue screening saves lives and money, while others argue resources could be better spent on other public health priorities and that screening can lead to overtreatment. 

In summary, while colorectal cancer appears the most likely diagnosis for Mr. X based on symptoms, other conditions should be ruled out through examination and testing. A diagnosis of colorectal cancer can have major implications on quality of life and psychological well-being, requiring counseling and support. There are several ongoing debates related to the best approaches for colorectal cancer screening and prevention in the general public. With proper treatment and management, colorectal cancer can often be survivable, especially when detected at early stages through routine screening.
