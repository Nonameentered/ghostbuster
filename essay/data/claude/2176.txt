The Effects of Land Clearance on British Soils Through Prehistory  

Throughout prehistoric Britain, humans cleared land on a massive scale through slash-and-burn farming techniques, the cutting down of forests, and the creation of fields for agriculture and animal grazing. This intensive land clearance and land use over thousands of years had significant effects on British soils that shaped the landscape and environment.

Initially, in the Mesolithic period from roughly 10,000 to 5,000 BCE, hunter-gatherer populations in Britain lived in temporary encampments and had little lasting impact on soils. However, with the transition to farming in the Neolithic period starting around 4,000 BCE, permanent settlement and the clearing of woodlands for crop cultivation began to alter soils in substantial ways. Neolithic farmers employed slash-and-burn techniques, cutting down trees and burning the wood to clear land and provide a source of ash to fertilize the soil.   

When woodlands were cleared and burned, the loss of tree roots destabilized soils and increased erosion. The ash from burning also changed the soil chemistry by adding potassium and phosphate but depleting nitrogen in the short term.  Over repeated burn cycles, the soil became nutrient poor. Neolithic farmers addressed this by leaving fields fallow, rotating crops, and applying manure and compost when possible. However, continued deforestation and land clearance still led to more erosion and thinner, less fertile soils. 
 
In the Bronze and Iron Ages, from roughly 2200 BCE to 50 CE, further woodland clearance accelerated for the expansion of farming and livestock grazing. Primitive ploughs were introduced, which turned over and mixed the top layers of soil. This brought more nutrients to the surface but also oxidized the soil and released carbon dioxide.  The introduction of iron tools made clearing land even easier. Large swaths of primeval forests were cut down, and soils were heavily compacted by livestock in the process.

By the end of the prehistoric period, much of Britain's natural forests had been cleared, and soils were extensively degraded.  Centuries of land disturbance and intensive agriculture had depleted soil structure, organic matter, and nutrients. Erosion was widespread on cultivated hills and in areas where protective tree cover had been removed.    

In conclusion, land clearance and agriculture in prehistoric Britain had substantial impacts on soils. The loss of forests, use of slash-and-burn techniques, spread of farming, and expansion of livestock grazing all contributed to deforestation, erosion, loss of soil fertility, and degradation of soil structure over the course of thousands of years. These changes made the landscape more open but also more vulnerable to environmental declineâ€”setting the stage for modern efforts in sustainable land management and soil conservation.
