Incomplete Tear of the Rotator Cuff: A Case Study

A rotator cuff injury is one of the most common shoulder problems. The rotator cuff comprises four tendons that cover and stabilize the shoulder joint, and incomplete or partial tears of these tendons range from minor fraying to tearing of only some of the tendon fibers. This case study describes an incomplete rotator cuff tear in a 55-year-old female patient. 

The patient first noticed pain in her right shoulder about 8 months ago. The pain has been gradually increasing since then and becomes much worse with overhead activities like reaching up to high shelves or lifting heavy objects. She has had difficulty brushing her hair and reaching behind her back. The pain is situated primarily over the outer aspect of the upper arm. The mechanisms of injury include wear-and-tear aging changes, overuse from repetitive overhead arm movements, and prior shoulder injuries or dislocations. Given the patient's age and her physically demanding occupation as a high school physical education teacher, her injury was likely due to repetitive overuse and aging.

The three major symptoms she is experiencing are pain, stiffness, and weakness. The pain is most bothersome at night and with specific movements like overhead reaching or pushing heavy doors open. The stiffness limits her range of motion; she is unable to reach forward fully or lift her arm out straight to the side. She also notices a loss of strength for pushing, pulling, and lifting objects at or above shoulder level. 

Upon physical examination, several clinical tests are used to assess for a rotator cuff injury. These include the drop arm test, painful arc test, and infraspinatus muscle strength testing. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows an incomplete tear of the supraspinatus tendon, thereby confirming the diagnosis of a partial rotator cuff tear. The MRI ruled out a complete tendon rupture or damage to the subacromial bursa.

In terms of treatment, the patient was initially prescribed rest, physical therapy, and oral anti-inflammatory medications. After 6 months of unsuccessful conservative treatment, she chose to undergo arthroscopic tendon repair surgery. During the procedure, the partially torn tendon is reattached to the humerus bone. The goal is to remove damaged tendon tissue, debride the partial tear and reattach healthy tendon fibers to their original site on the humerus, thereby restoring normal shoulder biomechanics and eliminating pain.

The patient's recovery after surgery spans about 6 to 9 months. The first few weeks involve rest, pain medication, and physical therapy including passive range-of-motion exercises. Stitches are removed after 14 days. Progressive muscle exercises are started around 6 to 8 weeks to strengthen the rotator cuff. The patient is advised to avoid active overhead movements during this period. Regular physical therapy continues for 3 to 6 months. Discharge occurs when the patient achieves normal range of shoulder motion and muscle strength, and is pain-free during activities of daily living. Home exercise should continue indefinitely to prevent recurrence.  

Several precautions are given to avoid re-injury. The patient is advised to strengthen her core muscles; use proper form with overhead movements; avoid very heavy lifting or pushing; and rest if shoulder pain returns. Lifestyle changes to minimize the risk of repeat tears include losing excess weight and aligning her workplace ergonomics to prevent overuse. The risk of re-tear is about 10% per year, so the patient must remain vigilant.

The injury has significantly impacted the patient's professional and personal well-being. As a physical education teacher, her normal activities have been curtailed, affecting both her work responsibilities and her sense of identity. She has also lost independence in her daily activities and has had to rely more on her spouse. However, with appropriate treatment, rehabilitation and prevention, patients with an incomplete rotator cuff tear generally have a good prognosis to return to their normal level of activity and function.
