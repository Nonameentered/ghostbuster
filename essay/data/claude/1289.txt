Here is a 500 word essay in response to the prompt:

The effects of changing the metal binding ligand and monomer addition time on the rate of transition metal mediated radical polymerization (TM-RP) were investigated. Two ligands, L1 and L2, and an initiator were synthesized. L1 had  stronger metal binding ability compared to L2. Five polymerization reactions were carried out with different methods to prepare polymers P1 through P5.

For P1, L1, copper bromide, and styrene were mixed together and styrene was added dropwise over 2 hours. The reaction showed a linear increase in molecular weight over time with a slightly lower rate constant, indicating a controlled polymerization. For P2, all reagents were mixed together at once. The molecular weight increased rapidly initially but plateaued quickly, indicating a loss of control. The stronger ligand in P1 maintained control compared to the weaker ligand in P2.

For P3, L1, initiator, and styrene were mixed together at once. The molecular weight grew linearly over time with a rate constant comparable to P1, showing controlled polymerization was achieved immediately after mixing. For P4, L2, initiator and styrene were mixed together at once. The molecular weight grew rapidly then plateaued, indicating a loss of control. The weaker L2 ligand resulted in a faster, uncontrolled polymerization compared to L1.

Finally, for P5, L1, initiator and styrene were mixed and heated to increase the rate of polymerization. The molecular weight grew rapidly over time with a high rate constant, indicating a controlled, living polymerization at an accelerated rate. Increased temperature increased the rate of activation and deactivation to speed up the controlled polymerization.

In summary, changing the metal binding ligand from weaker L2 to stronger L1 allowed for a more controlled polymerization. Adding the monomers dropwise or all at once with L1 still resulted in controlled polymerizations, but a dropwise addition provided more control. Increasing the temperature with L1 increased the rate of the controlled polymerization. The effects on the rate constants and molecular weight-time graphs show that modifying these parameters is an effective method to tune the polymerization rate while maintaining control.
