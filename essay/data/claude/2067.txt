Odontoceti, or toothed whales, are highly social and intelligent marine mammals that rely heavily on sound for communication, navigation, and sensing their environment. Toothed whales produce a variety of vocalizations for social purposes, including whistles, clicks, and pulsed sounds. Whistles are primarily used for communication between individuals and are thought to be unique to each animal, similar to human names. Clicks and pulsed sounds are often used during echolocation to sense the environment and locate prey.  

Echolocation, also known as biological sonar, involves producing ultrasonic pulses of sound and listening to the echoes that return to detect the location and shape of objects. Toothed whales produce rapid clicks that travel outward, reflect off objects or surfaces in the environment, and return to the whale's ears. By measuring the time delay between a click and the returning echo, a toothed whale can perceive the distance of objects. The properties of the echo also provide information about the object's surface texture, density, and movement. Scientists believe toothed whales have excellent perception of object shape from echolocation. Some species of toothed whales, like sperm whales, use echolocation to find and catch prey like giant squid in the deep ocean where light does not penetrate.

Echolocation requires anatomical structures adapted for producing and receiving high frequency sound. Toothed whales have modified nasal passages that allow them to produce ultrasonic clicks. They have fatty lobes on their foreheads, called "melon", which is believed to help focus the ultrasonic sounds. Two channels in the melon called "phonic lips" are thought to be the actual click sound generators.  Toothed whales also have anatomically specialized ears for receiving ultrasonic echoes.  Specialized fats and airways channel sound from the lower jaw to the middle ear, which is adapted for responding to high sound pressures and high frequencies. 

In summary, toothed whales rely critically on sound to function in their marine environment. They use a variety of whistles, clicks, and pulsed sounds to communicate and socialize with each other. Echolocation allows them to sense their environment, navigate, find prey, and avoid predators in the deep ocean where light does not penetrate. Their anatomy has several specialized adaptations for producing and detecting the ultrasonic sounds used in echolocation. Studies of odontocete communication and echolocation provide insight into their complex social behaviors and survival techniques.
