Arts venues have the opportunity—and, many argue, the responsibility—to promote social inclusion and celebrate cultural diversity through their artistic programming and offerings. Providing a platform for a range of diverse voices and cultural expressions allows more people to feel represented and welcome to engage with the arts. However, balancing the need to attract audiences and be financially sustainable with the goal of promoting inclusion and diversity can pose significant challenges for venues. 

The Birmingham Hippodrome and Derby Playhouse are two arts venues in the Midlands of England that take different approaches to showcasing diverse, culturally inclusive work. The Birmingham Hippodrome primarily hosts touring musicals, dance, and circus acts in its 2,300-seat auditorium. While its commercial programming aims for broad mainstream appeal, the Hippodrome has made efforts to bring in shows that celebrate cultural diversity, such as the musical The Color Purple in 2019 and the Chinese dance drama Shen Yun in 2020. However, some critics argue that the venue could do more to platform locally-based diverse art forms and voices from Birmingham's large ethnic minority communities.

In contrast, Derby Playhouse has a dedicated policy to promote diversity and inclusion through its programming and partnerships. As a producing theater, Derby Playhouse has more flexibility to develop its own diverse productions. For example, it has staged several plays foregrounding voices from marginalized groups, such as a 2017 adaptation of Zahra by local British Asian playwright Sayan Kent. Derby Playhouse also partners with local cultural organizations like QTIPOC Derby, a group for queer and trans people of color, to co-produce events. While this highly inclusive approach is admirable, it does depend on securing funding and resources to develop and stage this kind of programming.

There are several key challenges for arts venues aiming to increase their cultural diversity and inclusion. First, they must find a balance between programming that is commercially successful enough to generate revenue, and programming that achieves diversity and inclusion goals which may be more niche. Second, developing and staging diverse, multicultural productions often requires additional resources, funding, and expertise which many venues struggle with due to budget constraints. Finally, some argue that while presenting touring shows or partnering with diverse local groups are positive steps, arts venues could do more by actively commissioning and developing work promoting marginalized voices.

Overall, while the Birmingham Hippodrome and Derby Playhouse take rather different approaches based on their respective business models, they both demonstrate a commitment to improving cultural diversity and social inclusion in their local arts communities. Their efforts exemplify the kinds of actions —programming culturally diverse shows, forming partnerships, developing inclusive policies —that arts venues can take, as well as the challenges posed in striving for diversity and inclusion while remaining financially viable. With further resources and support, arts venues can work to overcome these challenges and platform marginalized voices in increasingly meaningful ways.
