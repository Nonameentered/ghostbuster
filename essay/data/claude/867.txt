There are several key differences between independent schools (also known as private schools) and state schools in the UK education system. The main differences relate to funding sources, admissions policies, curriculum offerings, facilities and resources, and general ethos. 

Independent schools are privately funded, typically through tuition fees paid by parents and income from private endowments and investments. State schools, on the other hand, are publicly funded by the government and local authorities. This key difference in funding sources leads to many of the other distinctions between the two types of schools.

Independent schools are able to set their own admissions policies and select students based on a variety of factors, including entrance exam scores, interviews, and ability to pay fees. State schools must follow the national admissions code and prioritize students based on strict criteria like proximity to the school. Independent schools can be highly selective, while most state schools have limited ability to select students.

The curriculum and subject offerings often differ between independent and state schools. Independent schools have more flexibility to offer niche subjects and extracurricular activities tailored to students' interests. They also have more freedom to adapt the national curriculum to their school's priorities and values. State schools typically have less flexibility and must follow the national curriculum closely.

Facilities and resources tend to be more extensive at independent schools compared to state schools. Due to higher fees and private funding, independent schools can invest in new buildings, technology, equipment, and other resources to a greater degree. Smaller class sizes and higher teacher-student ratios are also more common at independent schools.

Finally, the general ethos and environment tends to differ between the two types of schools. Independent schools typically have a strong focus on academic excellence and preparation for elite universities. They also aim to develop students' characters, values and leadership qualities through participation in extracurricular activities. State schools usually have a more diverse range of students and a wider set of goals, including promoting social equity and inclusion.

In summary, while both independent and state schools aim to provide students a high-quality education, there are some significant differences between the two types of schools in terms of funding, admissions, curriculum, facilities and ethos due to their varying operating models and target student populations. These factors contribute to a very different school experience and set of opportunities between independent and state schools in the UK.
