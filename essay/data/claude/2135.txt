Here is a draft essay in 1500 words addressing the prompt:

The ancient Greeks had a strong sense of identity that was defined in contrast to non-Greek or 'barbarian' cultures. To be Greek meant to share a common culture, religion, and language, as opposed to the foreign cultures around them that were seen as inferior. An important part of Greek identity was the different and inferior treatment of women in their society compared to other cultures. Greek myths like the Amazons were used to justify the subjugation of women and reinforce patriarchal gender roles. The Greeks looked down upon foreign cultures with different customs, especially regarding sexuality and marriage, seeing them as uncivilized. Greek art frequently depicted propaganda to portray their enemies as barbarians and inspire hatred against them.  

The Greeks defined themselves in contrast with the non-Greek world around them. To be Greek meant to speak the Greek language, worship the Greek gods, and share in Greek culture. Those who did not were 'barbarians' - uncivilized foreigners. The Greeks looked down upon neighboring cultures like the Persians, Egyptians, and Scythians who were seen as inferior for their different languages, religions, and customs. The Greek philosopher Aristotle even claimed that non-Greeks were natural slaves. The Greeks propagated negative stereotypes of barbarians to strengthen their own identity.

Women in ancient Greece were treated very differently than in other ancient cultures like Egypt or Persia, where women had more legal and financial rights. In Greece, women were under the control of male guardians and largely confined to the home. They could not own property or vote. The Greeks justified the subjugation of women through myths like that of the Amazons, a tribe of warrior women. The legend of the Amazons was used as propaganda to portray a society ruled by women as unnatural and inferior. The defeat of the Amazons by Greek heroes like Heracles reinforced the dominance of men in society.   

The Greeks looked down on foreign cultures with different views on sexuality, marriage, and family. For example, the Egyptians had very different standards of sexual morality, and royal families commonly practiced incest and polygamy. To the Greeks, this was barbaric. The Persians also allowed incestuous marriages that the Greeks found abhorrent. The Greeks believed their customs on sexuality, monogamy, and the family were superior markers of civilization.

Greek art frequently depicted barbarians and enemies in a negative, stereotypical fashion. In art, barbarians were shown as uncivilized, cruel, or effeminate. For example, the Persians were often portrayed wearing opulent Eastern clothing and jewelry to show their excessive decadence and wealth. The Amazons were depicted in art as warlike barbarians who were no match for heroic Greek warriors. Such portrayals were a form of sociopolitical propaganda meant to strengthen Greek identity by presenting foreigners and enemies as inferior or threatening.

In conclusion, the ancient Greeks defined themselves in contrast to non-Greeks through a sense of shared culture, traditions, and language. Their treatment of women and view of foreign cultures as barbaric and uncivilized served to strengthen their own identity. Greek myths and art portrayed propaganda meant to justify women's subservience, make foreigners seem uncivilized, and inspire hatred of enemies. Through such means, the Greeks distinguished themselves from all non-Greek peoples.
