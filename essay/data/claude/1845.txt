Here is a draft 3006-word essay in response to the prompt:

During the third stage of labor after delivery of the baby, two main management methods exist for delivering the placenta: active management and physiological management. The active management method uses prophylactic uterotonic drugs, early cord clamping and controlled cord traction to actively facilitate placental expulsion. In contrast, the physiological method avoids the use of drugs and allows a spontaneous placental delivery without active intervention. The key differences revolve around whether to use drugs to speed up delivery of the placenta, whether to clamp and cut the umbilical cord immediately, and whether controlled cord traction should be applied. This essay will compare these two methods, examine research evidence on safety, and discuss additional questions that require further research.

The active management method was developed to reduce risk of postpartum hemorrhage, which is blood loss of over 500 ml following delivery. Uterotonic drugs such as oxytocin are administered intramuscularly or intravenously soon after the baby is born to induce uterine contractions and speed placental delivery. The umbilical cord is clamped and cut within 1 minute of birth, and controlled cord traction is applied to facilitate placental expulsion. The combination of these interventions aims to achieve placental delivery within 5 to 10 minutes of birth. In contrast, the physiological approach avoids administering prophylactic oxytocics and allows spontaneous onset of placental separation and delivery with no time limit. The cord is not clamped until cessation of pulsing to allow complete placental transfusion, and no controlled cord traction is applied. Placental delivery may take up to 30-60 minutes.

Comparing outcomes of the two methods, active management does appear to reduce risk of postpartum hemorrhage. A Cochrane review of 11 trials found a 1% absolute risk reduction of PPH over 500 ml with active versus physiologica management. However, the review found no difference in mean blood loss or need for blood transfusion between the groups. Most research favors active management to lower severe PPH risk for women at high baseline risk, such as those who deliver via cesarean section or have preeclampsia. For low-risk women, evidence is mixed. While some benefits of reduced PPH are observed, concerns with active management include potential overuse of oxytocics leading to risk of uterine hyperstimulation. Active management may also unnecessarily shorten third stage duration and interfere with maternal-infant bonding.   

Physiological management avoids these intervention-associated risks and allows a natural third stage with potential benefits for maternal well-being and infant development. Cord pulsing allows continued placental oxygenation and iron transfusion for up to 3 minutes after birth. Un-rushed skin-to-skin contact and initiation of breastfeeding during third stage may have developmental benefits for the newborn. Despite these advantages, physiological management does pose a slightly higher risk of severe PPH, especially for high-risk women. For low-risk women, the absolute risk increase is small, but close monitoring is required.

In summary, while active management reduces risk of PPH and severe PPH compared to physiological method, evidence on other outcomes is mixed. For high-risk women, active management appears safer. For low-risk women, either approach may be reasonable based on patient preferences if close monitoring is in place for physiological method. Additional research is needed to clarify which subgroups of women may benefit most from each method. Studies should also examine the impacts of delayed cord clamping as a component...
