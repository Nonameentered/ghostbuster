Female expatriates continue to face significant barriers and challenges in the hospitality industry. Despite making up nearly half of the total workforce in the hospitality industry, women are dramatically underrepresented in expatriate roles, particularly in leadership positions. There are several persistent reasons why this is the case:

1. Family responsibilities: Family obligations and responsibilities continue to fall more heavily on women in many societies and cultures. The idea that women need to prioritize family over career continues to prevail.   Therefore, women may see international assignments as unattainable or unfeasible, given their family responsibilities. Male expatriates, on the other hand, typically do not face the same difficulties in balancing family and career when considering global assignments. Practical solutions could include companies offering family-friendly policies for expatriates of all genders, including benefits like spouse employment assistance, dependent education, and flexible work arrangements.

2. Unconscious bias in hiring and promotion: There is significant research showing that unconscious bias against women exists in recruitment and promotion processes, even when policies of equal opportunity and meritocracy are explicitly stated. This unconscious bias also applies to selection processes for expatriate roles. To overcome this, companies need to implement objective, data-driven approaches to hiring and evaluation. They also need to provide unconscious bias training for managers and executives involved in these processes.

3. In-group favoritism: The expatriate community at many global companies continues to be dominated by men. This can make female candidates feel like outsiders and that these roles are not for them. It can also lead to in-group favoritism, where managers and executives prefer candidates who are most like themselves. Promoting more women into expatriate leadership positions is key to overcoming this barrier. Having female role models and advocates in global leadership roles will help make these positions feel more attainable for women.   

4. Lack of mentorship and networking: Women frequently cite lack of mentorship and networking opportunities as barriers to career progression. This also applies to access to global opportunities. Companies need to establish formal mentorship and sponsorship programs to support high-potential female employees, especially those interested in expatriate leadership roles. Providing opportunities for women to network with company leaders and with other successful female executives in their industry is also important.

5. Lack of self-confidence: Research shows that women tend to be less self-promoting and confident in applying for leadership roles compared to their male counterparts. Unconscious gender stereotypes around ambition and likeability also negatively impact how women's confidence and self-promotion are perceived. Coaching and development programs can help build confidence in female employees and help them strengthen their self-advocacy skills. Promoting awareness of how gender stereotypes influence perceptions is also important for overcoming this barrier.  

In summary, while there has been some progress, female expatriates continue to face unfair barriers to global opportunities in the hospitality industry. With increased understanding of these challenges, practical policies, and proactive programs to develop and support women, companies can maximize the success and retention of female expatriates on international assignments. Achieving greater gender diversity in expatriate roles will benefit both women's career advancement and companies' business performance. Overall, it is vital for the industry to do more to make global hospitality careers accessible and equitable for talented women.
