The current way-finding system in the Armstrong Siddeley building has several usability issues that make it difficult for visitors to navigate the space efficiently. The issues include inconsistent and unclear signs, lack of maps, and lack of directions to key destinations.  To address these issues, a prototype redesign of the way-finding system was developed.

The signs in the current system are inconsistent in their placement, size, and information. Some rooms have multiple signs with conflicting information while other rooms have no signs at all. The signs that do exist are placed haphazardly at different heights and locations, making them difficult to spot. They also vary greatly in size, ranging from small paper signs to large permanent wall signs. The information on the signs is often unclear, providing room numbers but no names or purposes. This inconsistency and lack of clarity in the signs create confusion for visitors trying to navigate the building.

Another issue is the lack of building maps to provide visitors with a sense of the overall building layout. Without maps located at key entry points and junctions, visitors have no way of orienting themselves or planning an efficient path to their destination. They end up wandering the halls searching for the right room, which is frustrating and time-consuming. Maps are a standard component of effective way-finding systems but are notably lacking in the current system.  

Finally, there are no directions provided to major destinations within the building like lecture halls, classrooms, and faculty offices. Visitors who do not already know the building layout have no guidance on where to go to reach key rooms. Simply naming the rooms on signs is not enough - visitors need clear directions to navigate what can be a maze of hallways. The lack of directions further exacerbates the issues caused by the lack of maps and inconsistent signs.

To address these usability issues, a prototype redesign of the way-finding system was developed. The redesigned system aims to provide consistent, clear, and strategically placed signs; maps at key locations; and directions to major destinations. The new signs would have a uniform size and placement, with the room name, number, and purpose clearly identified. Updated building maps would be added at each building entrance, along with new digital kiosks providing interactive floor plans and searchable room listings. Arrows and overhead signs would direct visitors to lecture halls, classrooms, and faculty offices. These additions aim to make navigation logical, simple, and frustration-free for all visitors. The redesigned prototype system overcomes the usability issues of the current wayfinding system in the Armstrong Siddeley building to create a more positive user experience.
