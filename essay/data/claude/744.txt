André Bazin was one of the most prominent film theorists of the mid-20th century. In his essays on cinema, Bazin argued for the artistic and narrative superiority of films that employ deep focus cinematography over those that rely heavily on montage. Deep focus cinematography refers to the use of wide-angle lenses and adequate lighting to keep all parts of the frame in focus, from foreground to background. For Bazin, this technique better captures the ambiguity and complexity of reality compared to montage which fragments space and time. 

Bazin believed that deep focus contributes to a film's realism by preserving the spatial integrity of scenes and allowing the viewer's eye to scan the entire frame, making their own choices about what to focus on. In contrast, montage dictates what the viewer sees through rapid editing and close framing. Bazin argued that deep focus gives more agency to the viewer and allows for a more open-ended narrative, while montage manipulates the audience into seeing exactly what the director wants them to see. 

However, Bazin's arguments have been criticized as an oversimplification that valorizes one set of cinematic techniques over others. Some critics argue that realism depends more on a film's themes and plausibility than on its use of deep focus. Montage can be used to achieve realism when it helps to condense and convey information in a believable way. Deep focus is not inherently more realistic—its effects depend on how the director employs the technique.

Others argue that Bazin's distinction between 'ambiguity' and 'manipulation' is misguided. While deep focus may give more freedom to the viewer's gaze, the director still carefully composes each shot to achieve their desired artistic and narrative aims. The technique only appears more objective or realistic. In truth, any filmmaking technique is subjectively designed to manipulate the viewer's attention and emotions to some degree. Realism comes not from the use of deep focus alone but from all the cinematic devices working together cohesively.

Bazin formulated his theories in part as a criticism of the classical style of Hollywood continuity editing. He saw deep focus as a technique that subverts Hollywood's heavy reliance on shot/reverse shot and eyeline match editing. However, some argue Bazin overlooked the nuances of classical style. Continuity editing seeks to be unobtrusive rather than outright manipulative, giving a sense of objective reality. And deep focus was not foreign to Hollywood—filmmakers like Orson Welles and William Wyler employed the technique in creative ways without abandoning classical continuity.

In summary, while Bazin's theories were highly influential, his elevation of deep focus cinematography has been debated on several accounts. His arguments would have benefitted from recognizing that realism depends on more than one technique alone. But Bazin's writings remain a crucial touchpoint for understanding divergent views on cinematic realism and the historical conflict between montage and deep focus aesthetics. His attention to deep focus as a key example highlights the significance of cinematography itself to a film's meaning and artistic vision.
