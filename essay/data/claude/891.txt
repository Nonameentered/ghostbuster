The objectives of the electrical machines laboratory experiment were to study the characteristics and determine the efficiency of a three-phase induction motor. The methods used to accomplish these objectives were measuring voltage, current, power, torque, and speed under varying load conditions. 

The first set of measurements were taken to determine the no-load characteristics of the induction motor. No-load refers to the condition where the motor is running but not connected to a mechanical load. The no-load voltage, current, and power were measured to calculate the no-load power factor and total copper losses of the motor's stator windings. The no-load speed was also measured. These measurements revealed the induction motor's behavior when operating without producing any usable power output.

The second set of measurements were taken to determine the motor's performance under load at varying speeds. The motor was connected to a dynamometer, which applied different loads to the motor while measuring torque, speed, power, and efficiency. As the load increased in increments, the speed and power input also increased, but the efficiency started to decrease. The maximum efficiency point occurred at around 50-75% of the motor's rated load. After this peak, the efficiency dropped more rapidly as the load continued to increase. These measurements demonstrated how the induction motor's performance changes in response to varying mechanical loads.

The third set of measurements were taken to analyze the motor's performance using different voltage inputs. The voltage was varied from 80% to 110% of the rated voltage, and the resulting current, power, torque, and speed were measured at each voltage increment. Raising the voltage increased the current, power, torque, and speed, while lowering the voltage had the opposite effect. However, the efficiency peaked around the rated voltage and decreased slightly at higher and lower voltages. These measurements showed the effect of voltage changes on the induction motor's operating characteristics and performance.

In summary, the data obtained from the laboratory experiment revealed several key characteristics and the efficiency trends of the three-phase induction motor. The no-load tests provided a baseline, the load tests demonstrated performance under different operating conditions, and the voltage variation tests showed the effects of voltage changes. Analyzing these data sets helps to gain a better understanding of how induction motors function and how to optimize their operation.
