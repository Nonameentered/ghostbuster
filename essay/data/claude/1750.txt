Primates have four different types of teeth that are adapted for their respective dietary habits and activity patterns. Incisors are the narrow, sharp front teeth used for grasping and slicing. Canines are the pointed teeth used for tearing and piercing. Premolars and molars are the broad, flatter teeth in the back of the mouth used for crushing and grinding. Frugivores that eat a diet high in fruit tend to have larger incisors for slicing and smaller molars, while folivores that eat mostly leaves have smaller incisors and larger molars for crushing tough plant matter. 

The biological species concept proposed by Ernst Mayr defines species in terms of reproduction. According to Mayr, species are groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from other such groups. For two populations to be considered separate species, they must be unable to interbreed and produce fertile offspring. This concept emphasizes the importance of reproduction in generating and maintaining species diversity. 

There are several isolating barriers that can lead to the emergence of new species. Geographic isolation separates populations physically so that they cannot interbreed. Ecological isolation occurs when populations adapt to different habitats or niches and become separated. Temporal isolation means that species only mate or flower at different times so interbreeding cannot occur. Behavioral isolation arises when populations change their mating signals, rituals or timing so that they no longer recognize each other as potential mates. Genetic isolation happens when the two populations accumulate different mutations that make them incompatible.  

The most widely accepted hypothesis for speciation is allopatric speciation, where populations are separated geographically but adapt to their local environments over time until they become distinct species. Geographic separation eliminates the exchange of genes between populations, allowing them to evolve independently. Over generations, the populations diverge genetically and developmentally to the point where they can no longer interbreed even if they came into contact again. Allopatric speciation accounts for the diversity of life on remote islands and isolated habitats. Overall, primate dentition, species concepts and modes of speciation provide a window into evolutionary processes and adaptations.
