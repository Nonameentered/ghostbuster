Scenario planning is a useful tool for developing long term strategies in businesses facing disruptive changes and uncertainties. Kodak, the once dominant company in the imaging industry, faces significant changes and disruptions due to the transition to digital imaging technology. Scenario planning can help Kodak develop strategies to navigate this transition and remain viable and competitive. 

Scenario planning involves envisioning multiple scenarios or stories about how the future may unfold. It allows companies to consider various forces of change, how these forces may interact, and how these interactions can lead to very different but plausible futures. For Kodak, some of the key driving forces to consider in scenarios include:

1) The pace of transition from analog to digital imaging technology. The speed of this transition will significantly impact Kodak's film and paper business. Rapid transition will lead to a more disruptive scenario while a slower transition provides more time for Kodak to adapt.

2) The entry of new competitors and business models. New competitors like Japanese camera makers and tech companies are entering the digital imaging space in force. Their innovative business models and global reach threaten Kodak's market share. Aggressive moves by these new players would suggest a harsher scenario for Kodak.   

3) Changes in customer preferences and behaviors. How people prefer to take, edit, store, and share photos is changing. A shift towards heavy adoption of smartphone cameras, photo sharing on social media, and the use of photo editing apps suggest a scenario requiring major investments to build capabilities in these new areas. 

4) Macroeconomic conditions. Strong economic growth would fuel more spending on digital cameras and related services, suggesting a more favorable scenario for Kodak to make the transition. Weak economic conditions make the transition more difficult.

By developing multiple scenarios around how these forces may interact and play out, Kodak can identify both opportunities and vulnerabilities, and formulate strategies accordingly. For example, a rapid pace of technological change and entry of new competitors in a weak economy would suggest an especially harsh scenario. Here strategies may focus on radically cutting costs, divesting some business lines, and acquiring new digital capabilities. A moderate pace of change in a strong economy may allow Kodak to leverage existing strengths to transition to new services and business models at a more gradual pace. 

In conclusion, scenario planning is a useful tool for a company like Kodak facing a disruptive technological transition in a changing competitive environment with many uncertainties. Considering different scenarios around key driving forces of change allows Kodak to develop dynamic strategies to survive and thrive, no matter how the future unfolds. With a range of plausible scenarios in mind, Kodak can forge strategies that position it for success across many possible futures.
