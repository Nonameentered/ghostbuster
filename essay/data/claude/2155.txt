Heroism and leadership are two qualities that are often intertwined in narratives, whether ancient or modern. In Homer's epic poems The Iliad and The Odyssey, the heroes Achilles, Odysseus and others demonstrate heroic and leadership qualities that would still be admirable today, though they differ in some ways from the heroism and leadership shown by modern superheroes like Spiderman and Superman. 

Achilles, the central hero of The Iliad, shows leadership in rallying and commanding the Myrmidon soldiers, motivating them with a moving speech to join the war against the Trojans. Though Achilles withdraws from the war at first due to a dispute with Agamemnon, he is convinced by his friend Patroclus to rejoin the fight. However, Achilles also shows a more self-centered heroic quality in seeking individual glory and fame above all else. His desire to gain renown as the greatest warrior leads him to make decisions that endanger his fellow Achaeans. His leadership, then, is undermined by his extreme individualism and hot temper. In modern superheroes like Spiderman and Superman, on the other hand, heroism centers around self-sacrifice for the greater good and a sense of responsibility for the faceless masses of ordinary people. Their leadership is more democratic and focuses on teamwork to save as many lives as possible.

Odysseus, the hero of The Odyssey, demonstrates a more balanced form of leadership and heroism. As king of Ithaca, Odysseus is responsible and takes his leadership role seriously, working to protect his people. However, he is also compelled by a thirst for adventure and glory, embarking on his long voyage home from Troy after the war. His cleverness, eloquence, and wit make him a crafty leader, able to unify and motivate his men. However, his curiosity and desire for adventure also lead his men into danger, and many perish over the course of their journey. Still, Odysseus takes responsibility for these losses and risks his life to continue leading his men home. This blend of self-interest and responsibility for others makes Odysseus a complex and compelling leader and hero.

In conclusion, while the ancient heroes of Homer's epics and modern superheroes show some differences in their style of leadership and heroism, they also share some similar admirable qualities. All these heroes show a willingness to risk their lives for the good of others, though Achilles seems most focused on personal glory. Odysseus and modern superheroes like Spiderman and Superman also show a strong sense of responsibility in leading and protecting ordinary people with their superior abilities and status. Though separated by many centuries, these heroes reveal some important ideals about the relationship between heroism and civic duty that remain relevant today.
