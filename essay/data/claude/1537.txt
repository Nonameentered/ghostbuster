Emap, a major UK-based media company, successfully launched the new upmarket Italian fashion and lifestyle magazine ‘Grazia’ in February 2005, in an already crowded women's magazine market. The key marketing strategies that Emap used to successfully launch Grazia are: targeting a niche audience of affluent female readers interested in high-end fashion and celebrity lifestyle, using an aspirational brand positioning paired with high production quality, recruiting well-known contributors, leveraging promotions and free gifts, and capitalizing on advertising opportunities.

First, Emap targeted Grazia at a select niche audience of affluent female readers aged 25 to 39 who have an interest in luxury fashion, beauty, and celebrity lifestyle. The cover and content focused on high-end designer fashion and brands, as well as celebrity features and news. The glossy, colorful pages featured lavish photo spreads and fashion shoots in exotic locations. This niche targeting allowed Grazia to differentiate itself from the mass-market women's weeklies like Closer and Heat that were focused on gossip and reality TV stars. Grazia’s niche helped attract readers and advertisers interested in reaching an affluent audience.  

Second, Emap positioned Grazia as an aspirational, luxury brand by using high-quality design and production values. The oversized magazine featured thick, glossy paper stock, vibrant photography, and minimal text. It conveyed an image of an elite, indulgent product for sophisticated readers. This aspirational brand positioning matched the interests of the target niche audience and allowed Grazia to charge a higher cover price of £2, more than typical women's weeklies. The higher price, paired with the lavish design, enhanced Grazia’s exclusive and premium brand perception.

Third, Emap recruited well-known fashion journalists, stylists, and columnists to contribute to Grazia. The magazine was edited by Paula Reed, a respected fashion editor, and featured columns by popular journalists like Eva Chen. Having recognized and reputable contributors further elevated Grazia’s brand prestige and credibility among readers and industry peers. Their insights and expertise also attracted interest from fashion brands and retailers looking to advertise.
