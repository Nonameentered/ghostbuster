James Hillman, a seminal thinker in the fields of archetypal psychology and depth psychology, argues that the boundary between the self and the world is permeable and fluid. For Hillman, the psyche extends beyond the individual into the animate world around us, and psychological life is profoundly influenced by archetypes and images that transcend any single human mind. This view challenges the traditional scientific perspective in psychology that sees the mind as essentially contained within the individual. 

The dominant scientific paradigm in psychology holds that the mind is lodged within the individual, shaped primarily by biological factors and individual experiences. The self is conceived as a discrete entity that takes in sensations from the outside world but remains fundamentally separate from it. In contrast, Hillman argues that psyche extends into the world around us. He sees the human mind as open to influence from archetypes, ancestral patterns of thought and behavior, and the "soul of the world" - the animating principle that gives life to all natural phenomena. For Hillman, "soul" is everywhere, not just within individual human beings. 

Hillman's vision of a deeply interconnected psyche reaching beyond the individual into the world has profound implications for how we understand psychology and psychological well-being. If the boundary between self and world is permeable, then we cannot understand human consciousness by studying individuals in isolation. We are profoundly shaped by our relationships to others - human and nonhuman - and by the images and archetypes embedded in our culture, religion, and natural environment. For Hillman, even psychopathology cannot be understood solely in terms of individual biographies and genetics. Depressed or pathological states of mind often arise from a lack of meaning and connection to something greater than oneself. Psychological health depends on nurturing a fluid and poetic relation to life, embracing mystery and ambiguity rather than seeking rigid categories and certain knowledge.

Hillman's ideas have been very influential, but they contradict the assumptions of mainstream academic psychology, which aims for a scientific understanding based on empirical and experimental methods. Some critics argue his approach is too relativistic or mystical. However, other researchers have built on aspects of Hillman's vision. Ecopsychologists argue that our embeddedness in natural environments is crucial for human development and well-being...

In conclusion, Hillman's radical reimagining of psychology challenges the notion of a separate, self-contained human self. By proposing that the soul finds its home not just within individual human minds but throughout all of life, Hillman reminds us that we can never understand the human psyche in isolation. His vision of a deeply interconnected world insists on the importance of meaning, beauty, and our relationship to the world around us for human psychological health and maturity. For Hillman, recognizing the fluid boundary between self and world - and embracing that uncertainty rather than resisting it - is the mark of a soulful psychology.
