Here is a draft 1750-word essay in response to the prompt on the effects of EU accession on Poland's agricultural policies and sector:

Poland's accession to the European Union in 2004 had a significant impact on its agricultural sector and policies. Poland had pursued generally protectionist agricultural policies during the Communist era and in the years immediately following the end of communism. However, upon joining the EU, Poland was required to harmonize its agricultural policies with the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This involved a shift to more market-based agricultural policies, reduced subsidies and tariffs, and greater competition from agricultural imports, particularly from Western Europe.  

The CAP is focused on a single internal market for European agriculture, with unified standards and subsidies across countries. Poland's farmers received direct payments under the CAP and benefited from export subsidies and intervention buying of certain commodities. However, overall subsidies to Polish farmers declined in the years after EU accession. The EU also placed limits on production volumes and required more stringent food safety, hygiene, and environmental standards. Meeting these standards imposed costs on Polish farmers. At the same time, Polish farmers faced more competition from agricultural imports from the rest of the EU, as trade barriers were eliminated. While some Polish farmers adapted well to the new environment and increased trade within the single market benefited consumers, other farmers struggled.

EU accession led to a major restructuring of Poland's agricultural sector. The number of individual farms declined, as many small subsistence farmers exited the sector and larger commercial farms expanded. There was a shift toward farms specializing in certain commodities, such as dairy, grains, or horticulture. Productivity increased on the most competitive farms, but income inequality also rose across the agricultural sector. The total agricultural workforce declined, and some agricultural workers migrated to other sectors or Western European countries.  

Food prices declined for Polish consumers in the years following EU accession due to greater availability of imports and lower overall subsidies and trade barriers. However, the prices farmers received for their commodities also declined during this period. The revenue of farms declined in real terms, even as costs were rising to meet EU standards. Many analysts argue more could have been done to support small Polish farmers during the transition period. Some want Poland to push for reforms to the CAP to provide more subsidies and protections for its farmers.

In conclusion, while EU accession brought benefits to Polish consumers and some commercial farmers, it also imposed major adjustments on the agricultural sector as a whole. The competitive pressures, loss of subsidies and trade protections, and costs of compliance with EU policies hit small farmers in Poland particularly hard. However, Poland's agricultural sector has stabilized in recent years, as the most competitive farms have endured and become integrated into the European single market. The long-term impacts of CAP harmonization on Poland's agricultural policies and sector remain complex, with both opportunities and challenges ahead.
