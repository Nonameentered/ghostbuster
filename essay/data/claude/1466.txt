Here is a draft 500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Jessica feels overshadowed by her older sister Emma in numerous ways. Emma has always been the high achiever in the family, excelling in academics and extracurricular activities. She is now attending Jessica's parents' alma mater, an Ivy League university, and is poised to continue the family tradition of success and accolades. In contrast, Jessica has always struggled in school and hasn't found her passion or talent yet. Her interests lie in music and songwriting, but she feels her parents do not value or understand this skill in the same way they value Emma's accomplishments.  

Jessica's talent is writing and performing her own music, which she keeps private from her family. She has been writing songs since a young age as a way to express her feelings, but does not feel comfortable sharing this part of herself with her parents or sister. Emma has always been the center of attention and praise, and Jessica feels her musical pursuits would not measure up in her parents' eyes. They expect her to follow in Emma's footsteps and have a traditional career as a doctor, lawyer or businessperson. Pursuing music full-time would be seen as an unacceptable risk.

The pressure from Jessica's parents to achieve in the same way Emma has achieved has stifled Jessica's desire to pursue songwriting professionally. She feels she cannot compete with the accomplishments and accolades of her sister, who has always been the favorite and golden child. This has made Jessica feel that her talent and passion for music would never be supported or celebrated by her family. The only way she sees to gain her parents' approval is to suppress her own dreams and mimic her sister's path to a stable and traditional career. Overall, the pressure to live up to the family's expectations and her sister's success has greatly diminished Jessica's self-confidence in her talent and desire to pursue her musical passions.
