Chest pain presents commonly to Accident and Emergency departments with a wide range of potential causes. Atypical presentations for acute coronary syndromes such as NSTEMIs and STEMIs are possible and require consideration given the risk to patient health.  

The most common cause of chest pain presenting to A&E is angina or acute coronary syndrome. This can range from stable angina to NSTEMI or STEMI. A STEMI typically presents with persistent chest pain, shortness of breath, and ECG changes indicating ST-segment elevation. An NSTEMI may have similar symptoms but no ST-segment elevation on ECG, caused by partial blockage of a coronary artery. However, there are many possible atypical presentations of these acute cardiac events that require recognition. These include indigestion-like pain, back pain, syncope, fatigue or upper abdominal pain as patients can describe the pain differently or it may radiate to other areas. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is required. 

Other potential causes of chest pain include gastroesophageal reflux disease, musculoskeletal injuries or chest wall pain, pneumonia or pleurisy, pulmonary embolism, aortic dissection or pericarditis. Peptic ulcer disease and gallstones should also be considered as causes of referred pain to the chest. A thorough history and examination along with initial investigations can help distinguish between these diagnoses. 

Initial routine blood tests for chest pain of unknown cause should include a complete blood count to check for signs of infection; urea and electrolytes for imbalances; a troponin assay to exclude NSTEMI; liver and thyroid function tests. A chest x-ray, ECG and echocardiogram are also commonly performed to evaluate the heart and nearby thoracic structures. More advanced tests such as CT pulmonary angiograms may be required for suspected pulmonary embolism.

In summary, there are various acute coronary syndromes with a range of atypical presentations that can manifest as chest pain in A&E. The history, examination and results of initial routine blood tests and ECG help determine the likelihood of different diagnoses and guide treatment decisions regarding further investigation, management of the underlying cause and risk stratification. A patient with an arrhythmia, pleurisy or indigestion will be managed very differently to one with an NSTEMI or aortic dissection, so recognition of atypical presentations and thorough initial assessment is key.
