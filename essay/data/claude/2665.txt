Several factors influence the geometries of transition metal complexes. The primary factors are the electronic configurations of the metal ion and the ligands, steric effects, and minimization of ligand-ligand repulsions. 

The d-orbital occupancy of the metal ion influences its preferred geometry. Metal ions with high d-orbital occupancy, especially d5 and d10 ions, tend to adopt symmetrical geometries that maximize ligand-metal bonding, such as octahedral or square planar. However, as the d-orbital occupancy decreases, the geometry often becomes distorted or less symmetrical to allow for stronger metal-ligand bonding. For example, tetrahedral or square planar geometries are common for d6 or d8 transition metals where there are fewer d-electrons available for metal-ligand bonding.

Steric effects refer to the repulsions between ligands that can distort geometries away from the ideal. Bulky ligands will distort the geometry to increase the distance between them, even if it means a decrease in ligand-metal bonding. For example, nickelocene, Ni(C5H5)2, adopts an eclipsed conformation rather than staggered due to Ï€-stacking of the cyclopentadienyl rings despite greater steric repulsion. In some cases, steric effects can outweigh the benefit of a low-energy square planar configuration.

The minimization of ligand-ligand repulsions also influences geometry. Ligands will orient themselves to minimize unfavorable interactions which can result in geometries that are distorted from the ideal. The hapticity, denticity, and bulkiness of the ligands are all factors that determine the severity of ligand-ligand repulsions.

In the complex Ni(NCS)2(PPh3)2, the (NCS)- ligand likely coordinates in an axial position. The square planar geometry is preferred with two PPh3 ligands in the equatorial plane to minimize steric repulsion between the bulky phosphine ligands. The linear thiocyanate ligand would experience greater steric strain if bound equatorially, therefore, favoring the axial positions. The electronic configuration of Ni2+, d8, also prefers a square planar geometry to maximize metal-ligand bonding. Therefore, both steric and electronic factors point to the (NCS)- ligand occupying the axial positions in this complex.

In summary, the geometry of transition metal complexes is determined by a balance of the electronic configuration of the metal, steric effects between ligands, and the minimization of unfavorable ligand-ligand interactions. For bulky ligands like PPh3, steric factors can outweigh the benefit of an ideal square planar or octahedral geometry. Through analysis of these factors, the co-ordination mode of ligands can often be deduced.
