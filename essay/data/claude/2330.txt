Here is a 1500-word essay in response to the prompt:  

Extraordinary births in Greek mythology, where a mortal woman gives birth to a god or hero, often signify that the child is destined for greatness or has a special connection with the divine. However, these special births also reflect ancient Greek ideals about reproduction, parenting, and gender roles.

Some of the most famous heroes of Greek mythology were born of extraordinary births where a god impregnates a mortal woman. For example, Heracles was the son of Zeus and the mortal woman Alcmene. His half-brother Perseus was also born of Zeus and a mortal woman, Danae. Their divine paternity signifies that they were fated for great deeds and to have a close connection with the gods. In contrast, ordinary mortal births in Greek mythology typically result in ordinary mortals with no particular destiny. The extraordinary birth denotes the extraordinary nature of the child.

These special births also often involve a show of divine will or prophecy. For example, Perseus's mother Danae was locked in a tower by her father, but Zeus came to her in a shower of gold, impregnating her. The god's will could not be denied. The mortal woman has little choice or agency in these births; they are at the whim of the god. This reflects a general theme in Greek mythology of the lack of agency or self-determination for women. They are often subject to the desires and will of the male gods.

The role of the mortal woman in these stories is to give birth to and raise the hero, but she has little influence over his destiny or deeds. The heroes are shaped primarily by their divine nature and the will of the gods. For example, Alcmene raises Heracles but has little say in the labors he must perform to achieve immortality. The heroes' deeds and stories ultimately belong to their divine lineage, not their mortal upbringing. This also reflects the relative unimportance of motherhood and child-rearing in Greek culture, compared to the male spheres of battle, adventure, and politics.

In conclusion, extraordinary births in Greek mythology signify the special destiny of the child and their connection to the divine. However, they also reflect the relative powerlessness and unimportance of women in these stories. The mortal mothers are simply vessels through which heroes and gods enter the mortal world, and they have little agency or influence over the child's destiny or deeds. These myths demonstrate the patriarchal ideals of Greek culture, where women were subordinate to men and the major spheres of power and agency belonged to the male domain.
