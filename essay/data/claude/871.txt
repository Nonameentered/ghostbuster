To what extent did developments in the American eugenics movement influence the shape of German and later Nazi racial hygiene?

The eugenics movements in the United States and Germany were intricately connected in the early 20th century. American eugenicists influenced and inspired their German counterparts, who went on to shape Nazi racial policy. At the same time, eugenic ideas were widely discussed and accepted internationally during this period. While American eugenicists helped legitimize and spread such ideas to Germany, German eugenicists and Nazis took these concepts to an extreme in developing their policies of racial hygiene.

The American eugenics movement emerged in the early 1900s and promoted the idea that the human population could be improved through selective breeding. Eugenicists argued that social, physical, and mental traits were primarily hereditary. They sought to encourage reproduction of those with desirable traits—the "fit"—while discouraging reproduction of those with undesirable traits—the "unfit." This was achieved through measures like forced sterilization of the "unfit," immigration restrictions, and anti-miscegenation laws. 

The leading advocates of eugenics in the U.S. were scientists and philanthropists. Charles Davenport established the Eugenics Record Office, which studied family lineages to identify the hereditary basis of favorable and unfavorable traits. Harry Laughlin lobbied for restrictive immigration laws and forced sterilization. The philanthropic Carnegie Institution and Rockefeller Foundation funded much of the eugenics research in this period. Eugenics was taught in high schools and colleges and was widely discussed in popular media. Between 1907 and 1939, 33 U.S. states passed laws allowing for the sterilization of certain "unfit" individuals, with over 60,000 people sterilized in total.

The American eugenics movement had a significant influence on Germany. Early German eugenicists looked to their U.S. counterparts for scientific theory and legitimacy. The first eugenics society in Germany was founded in 1905, just two years after the founding of Britain's Eugenics Education Society, by German psychiatrist Alfred Ploetz, who corresponded with Charles Davenport. The Rockefeller Foundation and several American philanthropists funded German eugenics institutes and research in the 1920s and 1930s. German eugenicists translated many American eugenics publications to spread concepts like racial hygiene.

The rise of the Nazi Party brought eugenics to the forefront of policymaking in Germany. The Nazis admired the American eugenics movement and its success in achieving legal sterilization and immigration restriction. After taking power in 1933, the Nazis enacted the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring, which mandated the forced sterilization of those with certain medical conditions. The Nazis' program of forced sterilization eventually led to the Holocaust, with over 350,000 individuals sterilized between 1933 and 1945. The Nuremberg Laws of 1935 established a system of racial hygiene that classified and segregated individuals based on their "blood."

While the American and German eugenics movements were closely linked, the horrific policies of the Nazis represented an extreme distortion of eugenic concepts. Most eugenicists in the U.S. and other Western nations did not support such radical measures as genocide. Still, the American eugenics movement helped normalize ideas of racial and genetic hierarchy that were then exploited by the Nazis to justify their brutal agenda. By the time the Nazis rose to power, eugenics had gained mainstream credibility as a scientific field, which the Nazis manipulated to promote their racist ideology.  

In conclusion, the American eugenics movement had a significant influence on the development of German racial hygiene which later shaped Nazi ideology. Through the spread of eugenic publications, funding of research institutes, and model of legal sterilization programs, American eugenicists helped popularize concepts of racial improvement and hierarchy in Germany. However, the Nazis took eugenics to an extreme by developing policies around racial purity that condoned mass murder. While eugenics was widely accepted in the early 20th century, its radical application by the Nazis showed the moral bankruptcy of theories of racial hierarchy, ultimately discrediting eugenics worldwide. The dark history of this era serves as a warning for the influence of scientific rationales on dehumanizing policies.
