Here is a 1750 word essay in response to the prompt:

The problem of evil challenges the existence of the God of Classical Theism, who is defined as an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent being. If such a God exists, how can there be evil and suffering in the world? Various theodicies have been proposed in response to defend God's existence, but ultimately, they fail to reconcile the existence of evil with a merciful and all-loving God. 

One common theodicy argues that evil exists as a result of free will. According to this defense, God gave humans free will, and evil is the byproduct of humans exercising free will to act immorally. However, this does not explain natural evils that cause suffering, like natural disasters, diseases, and catastrophes. An omnipotent God could have created a world with free will but without these gratuitous harms. Therefore, the existence of natural evils suggests that God is not omnipotent or not omnibenevolent enough to prevent such suffering.

Another theodicy proposes that evil exists so we can develop virtues like courage, compassion, and sacrifice. However, an all-loving God would not require evil to cultivate positive virtues and would find another way. Additionally, the immense suffering in the world far outweighs any opportunity for building character. The scale of horrors - genocides, wars, atrocities - makes it implausible that a merciful God would allow such egregious evils just for spiritual or moral development. 

Some argue that God gave humans free will to choose between good and evil, and evil arises from human misuse of free choice. But natural evils like diseases, natural disasters and accidents that kill innocent people have nothing to do with free will but cause immense suffering. And an omnipotent God would have the power to stop evil acts like murder without violating free will. He could have created a world with free choice but without the possibility of evil. The reality of senseless suffering suggests God lacks either perfect power, perfect knowledge, or perfect goodness.

In conclusion, while theodicies try to reconcile God's existence with the problem of evil, they fail to account for the full depth of suffering in the world. They do not justify why an all-loving and all-powerful God would create or allow such evils to exist. The immense scale of atrocities, catastrophes and other harms in the world strongly suggests that the God of Classical Theism does not exist, or at a minimum, lacks one or more of the divine attributes of omnipotence, omniscience or perfect goodness. The incompatibility of evil and suffering with the existence of such a God remains an unsolved paradox.
