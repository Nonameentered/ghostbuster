There are three main theories associated with language and gender: deficit, dominance, and difference. The deficit theory suggests that women's language is deficient or lacking in some way compared to men's. This theory was proposed by Robin Lakoff in her 1975 book Language and Woman's Place. Lakoff claimed that women's speech reflected their subordinate status in society. She pointed to linguistic features like hedges, tag questions, and rhetorical questions as evidence that women's language was less assertive and confident than men's. 

The dominance theory argues that language is male-dominated and reinforces patriarchal power structures in society. Proposed by Dale Spender, this theory suggests that masculine forms of language have become the norm, while feminine forms of speech are devalued or marginalized. Spender points to the use of generic "he" and other male-centered language as evidence of how language privileges masculine ways of speaking and experiencing the world.

In contrast, the difference theory proposes that men's and women's language differs in systematic ways due to cultural and social factors, but that one form is not inherently better or worse. Researchers taking a difference approach study how gender is constructed and performed through language. They examine how people use language to express gender identities and emphasize both differences and similarities between men's and women's speech.

Research on language and gender has challenged and supported aspects of these three theories. Studies largely refute the deficit theory and the notion that women's language is inherently deficient. However, research does suggest some differences between men's and women's speech that could reflect influence of cultural and social gender roles. For example, some studies found that women tend to use more hedges and tag questions in certain contexts, suggesting women may face more pressure to appear friendly and accommodating. But in other contexts, these differences disappear, suggesting they are not inherent features of women's language but rather reflect contextual influences.

At the same time, research supports aspects of the dominance theory, demonstrating how some linguistic features privilege masculine ways of speaking. For example, the use of "he" as a generic pronoun and semantic  derogation, the process by which words associated with women acquire negative or trivializing connotations, reflect a male bias in language that perpetuates  stereotypical gender roles and power structures. However, masculine forms of speech are not always dominant, and in some contexts or discourse communities, feminine forms of language may even be preferred or hold covert prestige.

In summary, all three theories of language and gender capture important insights, but require nuance and qualification in light of research. Language reflects and constructs gender identities in complex ways. Differences between men's and women's speech likely arise from a combination of both cultural/social factors as well as inherent properties, and the relationship between language and power is multidimensional. Overall, there is no definitive evidence that one gender's way of speaking is inherently better or worse. Ongoing discussion and research on language and gender can help promote understanding and inclusiveness.
