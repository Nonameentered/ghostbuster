The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act (HFE) set the regulatory framework for reproductive technology and research involving embryos in the UK. The HFE established the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) in 1990 to regulate reproductive medicine. The HFE tightly controls reproductive technologies such as IVF treatment, embryo research, and the use of human embryos. The HFE originally only allowed reproductive technologies when medically indicated, such as for infertility treatment, and banned reproductive technologies like surrogacy or genetic selection of embryos for anything other than medical benefit.

The HFE has limited certain reproductive technologies and research involving human embryos in the UK. For example, the HFE banned human reproductive cloning and only allowed embryo research for up to 14 days after fertilization. The HFE also originally banned Pre-Implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) for anything other than serious medical conditions. However, in 2006, the High Court allowed PGD for HLA tissue typing to select embryos that could provide umbilical cord blood to save the life of an existing child. This exception showed the conflicting interests between regulating reproductive technologies to prevent their misuse and allowing parents reproductive autonomy to choose to have a child that could save another child's life.  

There are conflicting interests involved in regulating reproductive genetics. On the one hand, regulation aims to prevent the misuse of technology for human enhancement or discrimination. But regulation also risks limiting reproductive freedom and autonomy. The interests of prospective parents in choosing to have children who could provide medical benefit to existing children must be balanced with concerns about "designer babies." The High Court's justification of PGD for HLA typing to save life opened the door for arguments that parental interests in reproductive choice should be prioritized over slippery slope concerns.

Changes are still needed in the regulation of reproductive technologies. The HFE is outdated and needs reform to keep up with scientific progress. Some argue regulation should be relaxed to expand reproductive choice and access to innovative treatments. Others argue regulation must prevent undesirable uses of reproductive technologies like human germline editing. The regulation of reproductive medicine needs to strike a balance between autonomy, health, ethics, and social interests. Overall, regulation shapes the development and application of reproductive technologies in ways that reflect a societyâ€™s values. The HFE will continue to evolve to navigate conflicting interests in this area.  

In summary, the HFE established regulation of reproductive technologies in the 1990s that limited certain treatments and research involving human embryos. The High Court's decision to allow PGD for HLA typing showed the competing interests involved in regulating reproduction and genetics. Changes to regulation are still needed to keep up with scientific progress and balance conflicting interests in reproductive choice and ethics. Regulation fundamentally reflects a society's values regarding human reproduction and biotechnology.
