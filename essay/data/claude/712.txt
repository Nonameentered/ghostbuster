Environmental law in the European Union has evolved significantly over the past several decades. In the early years of the EU, environmental regulation was limited and primarily aimed at protecting human health and addressing local environmental issues.  However, as awareness of environmental challenges grew, the EU developed a more comprehensive set of environmental laws and policies to promote sustainability across the bloc. This transition reflects the EU's efforts to balance economic activity with environmental protection.

In the 1970s, the EU began adopting its first environmental laws, including the Waste Framework Directive and Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. These early laws focused on human health impacts and pollution control. They established minimum standards but largely left implementation to member states. Environmental regulation expanded in the 1980s and 1990s to address issues like air and water pollution, chemicals, and waste management on a broader, cross-border scale. For example, the Water Framework Directive established a framework for protecting and improving water quality across the EU.

The turn of the century marked a turning point as the EU sought to move beyond reactive regulation and promote environmental sustainability in a more systemic way. In the 2000s, the EU adopted laws like the Environmental Liability Directive, which held polluters financially responsible for environmental damage, and the REACH regulation, which imposed more stringent controls on chemicals. The EU also adopted its first sustainability strategy in 2001, followed by its flagship environmental policy, the Seventh Environmental Action Programme, in 2013. These aimed at "turning the Union into a resource-efficient, green, and competitive low-carbon economy."

To balance environmental and economic interests, the EU has relied on several legal mechanisms. It has set minimum standards for environmental protection while allowing member states flexibility in implementation. It has also used market mechanisms, like the EU Emissions Trading System, which reduces emissions in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the EU has increasingly incorporated environmental considerations into other policy areas like energy, agriculture, and transport. 

While the EU has made significant progress, challenges remain. Tensions persist between economic competitiveness and sustainability. Environmental policies have also highlighted differences in priorities and interests between Western and Eastern members. Nevertheless, environmental law has become an integral part of the EU legal order. The EU has established itself as a leader on sustainability and climate change on the global stage. With its Green Deal, the EU aims to continue balancing economic and environmental interests through a just transition to a sustainable future.

In conclusion, EU environmental law has evolved from a limited set of laws aimed at protecting human health into a comprehensive legal framework promoting sustainability. The EU has relied on minimum standards, market mechanisms, and policy integration to balance economic and environmental interests. Despite tensions, the EU has positioned itself as an environmental leader and aims to accelerate progress through its European Green Deal.
