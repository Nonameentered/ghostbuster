Here is a 750 word essay on the structure and applications of antibodies:

Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins, are Y-shaped proteins produced by the immune system in response to antigens such as bacteria, viruses or other foreign substances in the body. They are composed of two heavy chains and two light chains, with the arms of the Y containing binding sites that can attach to specific antigens. The structure of antibodies has been studied using techniques like X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance. These studies have revealed that despite their Y-shape, antibodies have a very complex quaternary structure with many disulfide bonds between cysteine residues holding the heavy and light chains together.  

Monoclonal antibodies are produced from a single B cell clone and bind to one specific antigen. They are more consistent and specific than regular polyclonal antibodies produced naturally in the body. Monoclonal antibodies are produced using hybridoma technology where antibody-producing B cells are fused with immortal B cells to create hybrid cells that produce the antibody endlessly. This allows scientists to produce large quantities of monoclonal antibodies with defined specificity.

Monoclonal antibodies have numerous applications in biochemistry, molecular biology and medicine. They are widely used as tools for detecting and purifying molecules in techniques like Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, ELISA and column chromatography. In medicine, monoclonal antibodies can be used for therapeutic purposes to neutralize target antigens. Some examples include trastuzumab which targets the HER2 receptor to treat breast cancer, infliximab which targets TNF-Î± to treat autoimmune diseases, and rituximab which depletes B cells in treatment of lymphomas and rheumatoid arthritis.

In conclusion, antibodies have a complex quaternary structure composed of heavy and light chains. While regular antibodies are produced naturally in the body in response to various antigens, monoclonal antibodies are produced artificially from hybridoma cells and have more defined specificity. They have enabled many techniques that have revolutionized biochemistry and medicine. Overall, antibodies remain an important tool for both scientific research and medical treatment.
