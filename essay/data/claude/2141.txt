There is a clear difference in the use of adjectives between broadsheet newspapers and online news sites in their match reports of the English national football team's games. Broadsheet newspapers, aimed at a more educated readership interested in in-depth analysis, tend to use adjectives sparingly and judiciously to describe events objectively and factually. In contrast, online news sites, aimed at a mass readership looking for entertainment and sensation, employ adjectives liberally and subjectively to dramatize events and provoke emotional reactions. 

Broadsheet newspapers like The Guardian and The Daily Telegraph construct their match reports to inform readers about the key events and facts of the game. Descriptive adjectives are used occasionally and precisely, to supplement the factual account or highlight particularly notable events. For example, in its report of England's recent 4-0 win over Bulgaria, The Guardian described England as “dominant” and Harry Kane's hat-trick as an “impressive treble”. The Daily Telegraph reported that England played with “zest” and “purpose”, and were “irresistible” in attack. These selective and measured uses of adjectives provide context but do not overly colour or dramatize the reporting of the actual match events.

In contrast, online news sites like Daily Mail Online and The Sun Online employ florid and embellished language in their match reports to generate interest and excitement. Their articles are peppered with numerous dramatic adjectives to emphasize spectacular events, portray flamboyant characters, and whip up sensations of both euphoria and crisis. For example, Daily Mail Online described England as “red-hot” with Kane “bewitching fans” and “magical” in his hat-trick performance; England's win was a “blistering” and “raucous” display that left fans “buzzing”. The Sun Online portrayed the “rampant” and “irrepressible” England “thrashing” a “hapless” Bulgaria in a “five-star” performance, with Kane's goals “stunning” and “sublime”. 

In summary, broadsheet newspapers employ adjectives judiciously in their factual match reports to inform readers, while online news sites use adjectives extravagantly to dramatize events and titillate audiences. The contrast suggests broadsheets address readers interested in analysis and objectivity, whereas online sites cater to mass audiences seeking entertainment, emotional stimulation, and hyperbole. The noticeably different application of adjectives hence reflects the distinct purposes and target audiences of these genres of sports journalism.
