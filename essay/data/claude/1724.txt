This report investigates three methods for estimating the torsional performance of I-section beams: the Saint-Venant theory, the elliptic integral method, and finite element analysis (FEA). Each method provides different levels of accuracy in calculating the torsional rigidity and stress distribution across the beam section.

The Saint-Venant theory uses a simplified model that approximates the I-section as a thin-walled tube. It can provide a quick estimate of the torsional rigidity but does not accurately capture the stress distribution, especially at the flange-web junction. The elliptic integral method provides a more refined analysis by modeling the I-section as a series of flat plates. It can calculate the torque-twist relationship and stress distribution with reasonable accuracy for most design purposes. However, it still makes simplifying assumptions about stress concentrations at the flange-web junction. 

FEA uses a complex computational model that divides the I-section into many elements to solve equilibrium equations and calculate stresses. It provides the most detailed and accurate stress distributions, capturing concentrations at the flange-web junction and other discontinuities. However, FEA requires specialized software and computational resources. For most typical design scenarios, the elliptic integral method strikes a good balance of accuracy and computational efficiency.

Several factors need to be considered when subjecting non-circular sections like I-beams to torsion. The torque-resisting capacity depends on the shape of the cross-section, with more circular shapes providing greater resistance. As the applied torque increases, the maximum shear stress will occur at locations farthest away from the shear center, like at the flange tips for I-sections. This can lead to high stress concentrations that require close attention. The accuracy of theoretical methods also depends on how well they model stress distributions at discontinuities where there are abrupt changes in geometry or material.

In summary, the report examines three methods - Saint-Venant theory, elliptic integral method, and FEA - for analyzing the torsional performance of I-beams. FEA provides the most detailed and accurate solution but at a high computational cost. The elliptic integral method gives reasonably accurate solutions for most design needs. Several considerations around section shape, stress concentrations, and modeling accuracy need to be accounted for when subjecting non-circular sections like I-beams to torsional loads.
