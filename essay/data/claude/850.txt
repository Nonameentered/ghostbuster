Designing a Torque Measurement System Using Strain Gauges  

To measure the torque applied to a rotating steel shaft, a strain gauge based measurement system can be designed using a Wheatstone bridge circuit. Strain gauges are resistive sensors that change resistance based on the amount of strain applied. By bonding multiple strain gauges to a shaft at different orientations, the torque applied can be measured.

Initially, a hollow steel shaft needs to be selected with an appropriate diameter and wall thickness to withstand the maximum expected torque. Four strain gauges should be bonded to the outer surface of the shaft at 90 degree intervals to measure surface strain in the axial and circumferential directions. Each gauge will have an initial resistance (R1) when no load is applied. As torque is applied to the shaft, it will experience axial and circumferential strain which causes the resistance of the gauges to increase (ΔR). 

A Wheatstone bridge circuit with an excitation voltage (Vex) is used to convert the change in resistance to a measurable voltage output (Vo). Two gauges with the same orientation are placed on opposing arms of the bridge to cancel the effects of axial strain and only measure the circumferential strain caused by torque. The other two gauges at 90 degrees measure axial strain which can be used to correct for any temperature effects. The output voltage is calculated using the equation Vo = (Vex)(ΔR1)/(R1 + R2 + ΔR1 + ΔR2).

To account for temperature changes which also affect strain gauge resistance, a temperature sensor should be included to measure any temperature change (ΔT). A gauge factor (K) of 2.15 can be assumed to calculate the resistance change from temperature (ΔRtemp) using ΔRtemp = K*ΔT*R1. By subtracting ΔRtemp from the total resistance change (ΔRtotal) measured by the Wheatstone bridge, the true resistance change from applied torque (ΔRtorque) can be found using ΔRtorque = ΔRtotal - ΔRtemp. ΔRtorque can then be used to calculate the applied torque (T) in Nm using a calibration curve.  

For the system to function properly, initial calibration of the shaft is required by applying known torques over the expected operating range and recording the corresponding output voltages. A calibration curve can then be created with torque on the x-axis and output voltage on the y-axis to be used for conversion in the fielded system. To monitor the torque in real-time, the output voltage needs to be sampled at an appropriate rate and converted to torque values based on the calibration curve. The torque data can then be displayed on a graphical interface for an operator.

In summary, a strain gauge and Wheatstone bridge based system can be designed to accurately measure torque applied to a rotating steel shaft. By properly conditioning the signals to account for temperature and using an initial calibration, this system can provide a dynamic torque measurement system to monitor rotary applications. The proposed design is a simplified overview, but with further refinement could be developed into a fully functional torque measurement and data acquisition system.
