How Did Working-Class Pressure Influence the Economic Policies of Britain and Sweden During the Great Depression?

The Great Depression of the 1930s was a period of immense economic hardship and suffering around the world. As unemployment soared and economic activity collapsed, governments scrambled to develop policies to counter the downturn and provide relief to citizens. In Britain and Sweden, the political pressure exerted by the working class—through votes, strikes, and protests—spurred the governments to adopt more interventionist economic policies to stimulate demand and aid the unemployed.

In Britain, the unemployment rate rose from 1.7% in 1929 to 14.3% at the height of the Great Depression in 1931. The Conservative government initially responded with austerity policies to balance the budget, but this only worsened economic conditions. When Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government took power in 1929, it adopted more interventionist policies, including increased unemployment benefits, public works programs, and protective tariffs. However, the government fell apart in 1931 over disagreements on how to address the crisis. The resulting National Government coalition slashed public spending and balance the budget, despite protests from the Labour Party and trade unions.

Working-class voters and activists strongly opposed the austerity policies and pushed for greater government intervention. The trade unions organized strikes and protests against public spending cuts, wage reductions, and layoffs. The British Labour Party and Independent Labour Party vocally criticized the government's policies and called for economic stimulus, higher taxes on the wealthy, and relief for the unemployed. Although the National Government won a landslide victory in 1931 on a platform of austerity, their policies failed to revive the economy. Under intense pressure, the government reluctantly launched a program of public works in 1934 and other modest stimulus measures. While the British government was slow to change course, working-class activism was influential in forcing reluctant policymakers to abandon strict austerity and provide greater relief.

In Sweden, unemployment rose from 3% in 1929 to 14.8% in 1933. However, the Swedish government pursued interventionist policies to promote recovery from an early stage. The Swedish Social Democratic Party, which drew support from industrial workers, had been in power since the 1920s. In the face of the Great Depression, it enacted large-scale public spending on work relief programs, subsidies for hard-hit industries, generous unemployment benefits, and a public housing initiative. The Swedish Employers Association and political opposition parties criticized these policies as too radical, but the Social Democrats were able to pass them due to their political dominance and support from the trade unions.
