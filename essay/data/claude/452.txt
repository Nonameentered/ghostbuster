Here is a draft essay of 3000 words in response to the prompt:

The postcolonial Peruvian state faced significant challenges in its approach towards the indigenous majority in the country. The Creole elites who controlled the state apparatus largely viewed the indigenous population, especially the Andean Indians, as inferior and uncivilized. This racist and exclusionary Creole ideology saw the indigenous peoples as obstacles to progress and modernity. As a result, the policies and programs of the state were aimed at assimilating the Indians into mainstream Hispanic culture and dismantling indigenous communities and cultural practices. However, these efforts were hampered by several factors.

Firstly, the sheer size of the indigenous population, making up the majority of Peru, posed a huge challenge. The state lacked the resources and capacity to penetrate into the Andean highlands and Amazonian lowlands where most indigenous peoples resided. Infrastructure was poor, and the state had limited administrative control in these regions. Secondly, the indigenous peoples were not passive subjects of the state's agenda. They actively resisted policies and programs that undermined their communities and identities. There were sporadic revolts and rebellions against unfair taxes, forced labour, and military conscription. The state repression of such resistance movements also alienated the indigenous peoples further.  

Thirdly, the ideological influences of liberalism and positivism led the state to adopt policies aimed at "civilizing" the Indians through education in the Spanish language and Hispanic cultural values. However, the public education system was poorly funded and lacked reach. Most indigenous peoples continued to speak their native languages and practice traditional cultural and religious customs. The state's vision of a homogenous nation-state was far from reality. Fourthly, the economic interests of the Creole elite depended heavily on the exploitation of indigenous labour in haciendas and mines. This hindered meaningful efforts to improve the social and economic conditions of indigenous communities.

In conclusion, racist attitudes, limited state capacity, active indigenous resistance, and exploitative economic interests were the major factors that challenged the Peruvian state's approach towards its indigenous peoples. Despite the intention to assimilate and "uplift" the Indians, the state failed to achieve effective control over most of the indigenous population, especially in the Andean and Amazonian regions. The vast cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity of Peru posed an irreconcilable contradiction to the Creole vision of a homogenous modern nation. The indigenous "problem" remained unresolved, and indigenous marginalisation continued in the postcolonial state.
