Peter Roach and David Brazil have proposed influential frameworks for teaching English intonation to adults. However, their approaches differ in objectives and coherence. 

Roach's system, as presented in English Intonation: A Practical Course, aims to provide a comprehensive and systematic model of English intonation for teaching intermediate to advanced learners. The framework centers around tonality types, tones associated with different syllables, and nuclear tones at the end of thought groups. While comprehensive, the intricate taxonomy of over 20 tones and numerous rules can seem overwhelming and abstract for learners. The prescriptive approach also implies an unrealistic kind of monolithic 'standard English' intonation.   

Brazil's framework, as articulated in Pronunciation for Advanced Learners of English, takes a more discourse-focused and practical approach geared toward proficient speakers. He outlines five key intonational features - tones, nucleus placement, key, range, and termination - and how they function in speech acts like requests, questions, statements, and attitudes. The functional perspective resonates more with learners and helps them grasp the social meaning conveyed through intonation. However, Brazil's model is more impressionistic, lacking the systematic categorization of tones that Roach's provides. 

In summary, while Roach and Brazil have been highly influential in the field of English intonation pedagogy, their frameworks reflect different objectives and strengths. Roach provides an intricate taxonomy of tones but can seem abstract and prescriptive. Brazil takes a more functional approach but lacks systematic explanation of tones. For teachers, a balanced and eclectic approach drawing on both models may provide the most comprehensive and practical system for demonstrating English intonation to learners. With an understanding of tone types and functions in real discourse, learners can develop an ear for natural and socially appropriate intonation.
