The Sandinista government that took power in Nicaragua after the revolution in 1979 quickly moved to overhaul the country's agricultural and rural economic policies. The Somoza dictatorship that preceded the Sandinistas had pursued agricultural export-led growth that enriched large landowners but did little to help the rural poor, who made up a large portion of Nicaragua's population. The Sandinistas aimed to restructure land ownership, improve living standards in the countryside, and make the agricultural economy more self-sufficient to reduce dependence on fickle global commodity markets. 

One of the first major steps the new government took was an agrarian reform program that redistributed idle and underused land owned by large landholders to small farmers and cooperatives. The Agrarian Reform Law of 1981 nationalized all farms over 500 hectares, redistributing the land to over 100,000 families. The reform resulted in the establishment of thousands of individual smallholdings as well as agricultural cooperatives, especially for the production of coffee, cotton, and cattle. The redistribution of land was a pillar of the Sandinistas’ goal to shift agricultural production in favor of staple foods for domestic consumption rather than export crops.

The Sandinistas also invested heavily in rural infrastructure and social programs to improve living standards, such as building roads to connect farmers to markets, expanding access to electricity and sanitation, and increasing funding for rural education and healthcare. The government provided agricultural credits, inputs, and technical assistance to help the newly landed small farmers and cooperatives become productive. It also set up state enterprises to purchase, process, and market agricultural goods. These measures aimed to strengthen the rural economy from the ground up.

To promote food security and self-sufficiency, the Sandinistas changed agricultural production incentives and policies to favor basic grains over export crops. They controlled the prices of staples like corn and beans to benefit producers while keeping food affordable for consumers.  The government invested in research and subsidies to expand rice and corn production, crops that made up a large part of the Nicaraguan diet. At the same time, the Sandinistas placed export taxes and quotas on commodities like coffee, sugar, and beef to generate revenue and shift land use. 
 
There were also efforts to organize small farmers and give them more political power and representation. The National Union of Farmers and Cattle Ranchers (UNAG) was created in 1981 to mobilize rural workers. The Sandinistas hoped the UNAG would give small producers a unified voice to influence government policy in their favor. However, the UNAG had limited independence and largely followed the party line.

The changes implemented by the Sandinistas achieved some success in transforming Nicaragua’s agricultural economy and improving living standards for many in the countryside. However, their policies also led to economic disruptions, and the contra war and US trade embargo took a heavy toll on agricultural production and exports. When the Sandinistas lost power in 1990, successive governments reversed many of their agricultural and rural reforms by privatizing state enterprises, reducing food subsidies, and promoting export-led growth. But the Sandinistas had highlighted the need to prioritize small farmers and food security—goals that would influence agricultural policy debates for years to come.
