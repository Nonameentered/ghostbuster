Here is a 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

There are two main types of strokes: ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes. Ischemic strokes are caused by blockages in blood vessels supplying oxygen to the brain, and account for about 87% of all strokes. Hemorrhagic strokes are caused by ruptures in blood vessels, leading to bleeding in or around the brain. 

Common symptoms of a stroke include sudden numbness or weakness, especially on one side of the body; confusion or trouble speaking; trouble seeing with one or both eyes; trouble walking; dizziness or loss of balance or coordination; and a severe headache with no known cause. Swift diagnosis and treatment of a stroke is critical to prevent long-term disability or death. Diagnosis typically involves blood tests, a CT scan or MRI of the brain, electrocardiogram to check heart rhythm, and carotid ultrasound to check for plaque buildup in the arteries in the neck.

The immediate management goals for an acute stroke are to stabilize the patient, stop any bleeding in the brain, restore blood flow to the affected area, and prevent complications. This is done through administering drugs to break up blood clots or control bleeding, clearing blocked arteries, and closely monitoring the patient. Rehabilitation, including physical, occupational and speech therapy, plays a key role in the long-term recovery and management of stroke patients. 

The effects of a stroke depend on the severity and location of the brain damage. Some potential long-term impacts include paralysis or weakness on one side of the body, difficulty speaking or understanding speech, vision problems, and depression or changes in mood and personality. With treatment and rehabilitation, many stroke survivors can regain independence and continue a meaningful life, although some level of disability typically remains.

The National Service Framework for Older People aims to improve stroke care for elderly patients in several ways. It sets national standards for prompt diagnosis and treatment, multi-disciplinary care, and rehabilitation as well as secondary prevention. It promotes early supported hospital discharge and community-based rehabilitation. It also emphasizes respecting patients' dignity, autonomy and consent, providing information to both patients and caregivers, and involving them in decision making.

Obtaining informed consent and maintaining clear communication are especially important for older stroke patients who may have physical or cognitive impairments. Consent discussions should be tailored to individuals based on their level of understanding and decision-making capacity. Caregivers and family members often play a key role in helping the patient understand treatment options, ask questions, and provide consent when the patient is unable to do so. With compassion and patience, the interdisciplinary stroke care team can work with patients and families to make the best decisions for prognosis, treatment and long-term management.
