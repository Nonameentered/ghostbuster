Material selection is crucial for the design and performance of many industrial applications. Two examples that demonstrate the importance of identifying the right materials are heat exchangers and computer chips. 

For heat exchangers, the key properties needed are high thermal conductivity to efficiently transfer heat, chemical stability to withstand exposure to various fluids, and low cost. After evaluating options like copper, aluminum, and stainless steel, copper is often selected due to its superior thermal conductivity and relatively low cost. The high conductivity of copper, around 400 W/mK, allows for the rapid exchange of heat between the hot and cold fluids. Copper heat exchangers are commonly manufactured using extrusion or brazing techniques, where copper sheets or tubes are bonded together. These manufacturing processes are compatible with copper and result in high performance, leak-free heat exchangers.

In computer chips, the material requirements are high electrical conductivity, low heat generation, and ability to be deposited in extremely thin, precise layers. Semiconductors like silicon meet these needs and are the foundation of modern computing. Silicon has an electrical conductivity between that of a metal and an insulator, enabling the control of electrical flow needed for digital logic circuits. The silicon is grown into wafers and deposited onto the chip substrate in layers just a few atoms thick using chemical vapor deposition. This precisely controlled process creates the complex integrated circuits in computer chips.

In both of these applications, extensive material analysis is required to determine candidates that meet the key performance criteria. For heat exchangers, the high thermal conductivity and low cost of copper led to its selection over other options. For computer chips, the unique electrical properties of semiconductors like silicon enabled the miniaturization and complexity of modern integrated circuits. But the manufacturing processes, like extrusion and chemical vapor deposition, were also critical to producing the final components with the desired shapes, bonds, and microscale features. 

So in summary, identifying the properties needed for high performance, selecting candidate materials that meet those needs, and choosing manufacturing processes compatible with the materials are all crucial steps in the design of industrial equipment like heat exchangers and computer chips. When done well, the result is highly efficient and cost-effective components that significantly impact both industries and society as a whole.
