The most efficient and cost-effective type of solar cell to use for a proposed photovoltaic (PV) array on a sloping roof near Reading, UK would be monocrystalline silicon solar cells. These cells, made of a single silicon crystal, currently offer the highest efficiency rates for converting sunlight into electricity at around 22-25% for commercial panels. While more expensive than polycrystalline silicon cells, the higher energy output means a faster payback period and lower cost of electricity over the lifetime of the system. 

For a PV array near Reading, the annual yield from monocrystalline silicon panels would be around 900-1150 kWh per installed kW peak power, depending on the slope and orientation of the roof. At an average residential electricity price of £0.15/kWh in the UK, the cost of electricity from a 4 kW monocrystalline system would be just £0.05-0.06/kWh over a 25-year period. The total energy yield over 25 years would be around 97,000-138,000 kWh, saving over £18,500 at 2020 electricity prices.

The annual output of the proposed Reading array would be significantly lower than an optimal array at a lower latitude with higher and more consistent solar radiation levels. For example, an identical 4 kW array in Benin, Nigeria may yield around 1600-2000 kWh per kW installed, some 50-90% higher than in Reading. However, the far lower residential electricity prices in Benin, around £0.04/kWh, mean the cost saving and payback period would likely be lower than in Reading, despite the higher energy yield. 

Funding for the residential PV project in Reading could come from a government grant or subsidy, such as the Smart Export Guarantee, which provides payments for unused solar energy exported to the grid. Feed-in tariffs have now closed to new applicants but provided up to £0.15/kWh for community renewable energy projects. Green investment funds or bank loans could also support the funding, with the cost potentially offset using a renewable energy incentive scheme. The profit and return on investment would depend on factors like system costs, energy prices and subsidies over time. For a 4 kW system, the lifetime profit could exceed £50,000 based on estimated cost savings.

In summary, monocrystalline silicon solar cells would likely provide the most efficient and cost-effective solution for a residential PV array in Reading. Although the annual energy yield may be 50-90% lower than an array in a higher radiation location like Benin, the higher electricity costs and subsidies in the UK mean the financial case for investment in Reading could potentially be stronger, generating a healthy profit and saving tens of thousands of pounds over the lifetime of the system. Funding and incentives further support the business case for adopting solar power for homes in the UK.
