Here is a 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, and Joseph Stalin were major thinkers and leaders who shaped communist ideology and the movement to establish communist states in the 19th and 20th centuries. While they shared some beliefs in common, such as the promise of a classless and stateless society under communism, they differed significantly in their views on democracy and its role in achieving a communist system of government.

Marx and Engels laid the intellectual foundation for communism in the mid-19th century. They believed capitalism was inherently exploitative and would inevitably collapse, giving way to a socialist system and then stateless communism. However, they were ambiguous on the role of democracy in this transition. Their Communist Manifesto suggested an initial 'revolutionary transformation' of capitalist society and would necessitate at least a temporary state apparatus. While Marx believed true democracy could emerge later under communism, the pathway to get there was unclear.

Lenin pushed for a vanguard party of professional revolutionaries to lead a violent overthrow of capitalism. He believed democracy was a 'bourgeois concept' that would not serve the interests of the proletariat. The vanguard party instead should take power through revolution and establish a 'dictatorship of the proletariat' to pave the way for communism. Lenin founded the Soviet Union on this model of democratic centralism, with authoritarian one-party rule. 

Stalin took Lenin's model to an extreme. He sought rapid industrialization and collectivization in the Soviet Union, using violence, terror, and repression. Stalin eliminated any meaningful dissent or political opposition. He claimed this was necessary to defend the communist project, but in reality, it was a totalitarian dictatorship with no democratic elements.

In sum, while Marx and Engels envisioned communism as a democratic system, Lenin and Stalin moved away from democracy and embraced authoritarianism as the means of transitioning society to communism. Their policies had devastating consequences, demonstrating that the disconnect between communist ideals and the reality of communist rule can be extreme when there are no democratic processes in place. Overall, democracy proved incompatible with these visions of communism in practice.
