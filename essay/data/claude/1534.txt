How National Culture Influences Emotional Labour in Service Encounters: A Comparison of Disney Theme Parks in the US and France

Service encounters are interactions between employees and customers that require emotional labour on the part of the employee. Emotional labour refers to the act of regulating one’s emotions and expressions to meet the expectations of the role or job. Emotional labour is particularly important in service roles that require frequent and ongoing interactions with customers. Employees in service roles often have to exhibit emotions that match customer expectations and company culture, even if they do not genuinely feel those emotions. Managing emotional expressions and delivering good service requires effort and can lead to emotional exhaustion over time. 

National culture significantly influences the ease with which employees perform emotional labour during service encounters. Cultural differences in values, norms, and expectations around emotional expression lead some national cultures to have greater comfort and skill with emotional labour. The culture of the company and expectations around service quality also shape emotional labour requirements. This essay examines how national culture impacts emotional labour by comparing Disney theme park employees in the United States and France.

The United States is typically characterized as a low-context culture that values assertiveness, friendliness, and positive emotional displays. American culture expects service employees like those at Disney theme parks to exhibit positive emotions and high enthusiasm during interactions with customers. Disney’s corporate culture also emphasizes extreme friendliness, cheerfulness and making personal connections with guests. These cultural and company expectations mean that emotional labour is an integral part of the job for Disney employees in the US. 

In contrast, France has a high-context culture that expects more restraint in emotional expressions. French culture values politeness, formality, and respecting others’ personal space. Open displays of emotions, especially very positive ones, are viewed as inauthentic or even rude. Given these cultural norms, French customers expect friendly and courteous service but not overly cheerful or intimate interactions. Disneyland Paris aims to provide excellent service to match expectations for French hospitality, but emotional labour requirements are less intensive relative to the US. 

A study of Disney employees in Orlando and Paris found that American employees described their work as “magical” or “bringing happiness to guests” and viewed emotional displays as a core part of their job. French employees focused more on technical aspects of their roles and viewed emotional regulation as secondary. American employees reported higher rates of emotional exhaustion due to constant emotional demands. French employees reported less emotional strain and a clearer separation between their private and professional selves.

In summary, national culture has a significant impact on the ease and effects of emotional labour in service roles. The level of emotional expressiveness expected in a culture strongly determines companies’ emotional labour requirements. Employees from low-context cultures like the United States that emphasize positivity and friendliness likely experience greater emotional exhaustion from high emotional labour roles compared to employees from high-context cultures where emotional restraint is the norm. Service organizations need to consider how cultural values influence customer expectations and adjust emotional labour requirements accordingly for optimal employee well-being and service quality. Overall, recognizing the role of culture is key to understanding emotional labour in the global service economy.
