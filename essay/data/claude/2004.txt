The pedogenesis, or soil formation, of the British Isles from the Neolithic to the Iron Age was shaped by both natural factors as well as human activity and land use. During this time period, spanning roughly 4500 BCE to 800 CE, the climate was temperate, with forests dominating the landscape. However, human settlement and the rise of agriculture led to deforestation and the development of grasslands and heathlands. These changes in vegetation and land cover drove changes in soil formation and development.  

In the lowland regions of southern Britain, natural forests of oak, elm, lime, and hazel dominated during the Neolithic, covering over 90% of the land. The soils were largely poorly drained gleys and stagnosols. With the rise of agriculture starting around 4000 BCE, forests were cleared for crop production and pasture, leading to the development of better-drained cambisols and luvisols. However, over-cultivation and the use of shallow-rooted crops caused widespread soil erosion, resulting in thinner topsoils. Around 2000 BCE, population growth led to further forest clearance and the expansion of pasture, resulting in the spread of grasslands and heathlands. The soils transitioned to podzols, characterized by the movement of organic matter and minerals from the topsoil to the subsurface, as well as histosols, or peat soils, in wetter areas. 

In the upland regions of northern and western Britain, natural coniferous forests dominated in the Neolithic, with soils similar to the lowlands. However, the uplands were less suitable for agriculture, so they remained forested longer. Major forest clearance did not occur until the Bronze Age around 2000 BCE, leading to the spread of blanket bogs and peat in waterlogged areas as well as acid grasslands and heathlands on better-drained slopes. The soils became peaty podzols and peaty gleys, with impeded drainage and accumulation of organic matter. Unlike the lowlands, upland soils were rarely cultivated and mostly used for summer grazing, so they were less prone to erosion.

In conclusion, the pedogenesis of the British Isles between the Neolithic and Iron Age was significantly impacted by human activity, especially the rise of agriculture and deforestation. Natural forests were cleared over time for crop production and pasture, leading to the spread of open grasslands, heathlands, and bogs. The soils transitioned from forest soils like cambisols and gleys to anthropic soils like podzols and peat in response to changes in vegetation and land use. While human impacts were most pronounced in the lowlands, the uplands also saw major shifts in soils and vegetation, though at a slower rate. Overall, humans shaped the development of the soils and landscapes of the British Isles during this time period through their use of the land.
