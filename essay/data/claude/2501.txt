The Armstrong Siddeley Building, a historic office building in downtown Ottawa, Canada requires thoughtful wayfinding interventions to assist visitors. Based on usability testing with a sample of 12 participants, here are three of the most useful wayfinding tasks that could be improved:

The first useful task is to create a directory at the main entrance that maps out the location and names of the 25 businesses in the building. While the building only has two floors, the layout can still be disorienting for first-time visitors. A large printed directory, with company names listed alphabetically along with their office numbers would provide an overview of where everything is located. This could reduce the time wasted wandering the halls searching for the correct office.  

Second, install strategically placed floor plan maps on each floor showing the locations of offices and pathways to navigate the space. During the usability test, several participants struggled with the unusual layout of the hallways and offices that bend around the historic architecture. Simple floor plan maps, with "you are here" indicators, at several points on each floor would give people a sense of how the space is organized and the routes to take.

Finally, improve office signage by adding the company logo to office doors or next to the office numbers. Some offices only had numbers outside their doors, while others had handwritten signs. Consistent, professional signage that incorporates logos would make it much easier to identify the correct office at a glance. This is especially important given the winding nature of the hallways.  

In summary, adding a main directory, installing floor plan maps, and improving office signage with logos are three of the most useful wayfinding enhancements for the Armstrong Siddeley Building based on usability testing. These changes would significantly improve the experience of navigating this historic downtown building.
