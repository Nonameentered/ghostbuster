Here is a draft 2500-word essay in response to the prompt:

Epistemological relativism (ER) is the view that knowledge and truth are relative to a conceptual framework, such as a culture, religion, or historical period. In other words, there are no absolute or objective truths that hold across all conceptual schemes. A defensible form of ER holds that knowledge and truth are relative to contexts, but some beliefs can still be evaluated as better or worse based on standards internal to those contexts. 

One common objection to ER is that it leads to an “anything goes” stance where all beliefs are equally valid or true. However, a context-dependent form of ER does not imply that all beliefs within a framework are equally warranted or reasonable. Even relativists can make judgments about which beliefs cohere best with available evidence and arguments within a specific context. Not all interpretations of evidence or logical reasoning are equally compelling. Relativists can still differentiate better or worse reasoned beliefs based on standards that are internally accepted.

A related objection is that ER entails a pernicious equivalence between conceptual schemes, such that we cannot judge one as better than another. However, context-dependent ER does not rule out relativized judgments that some frameworks are more reasonable, coherent, or conducive to flourishing based on values within those frameworks. Frameworks can still be compared on internal grounds, even if there are no absolute grounds for comparison. Relativism is a meta-level claim about knowledge across contexts, not an equivalence claim within contexts.

The most serious objection is that ER is self-defeating or inconsistent. If all knowledge is relative, then ER itself must only be relatively true, undercutting its status as an objective claim about knowledge. However, this objection relies on an absolutist assumption that for any claim to be true it must be absolutely or universally true. Context-dependent ER can avoid inconsistency by acknowledging its own context-dependence. It claims only that knowledge is relative within and across conceptual frameworks, not that this view itself transcends all frameworks. Relativism as a philosophical theory is put forward from within a broad rationalist-secular framework, not as an absolute truth.

In conclusion, a defensible version of ER can acknowledge relativism about knowledge while avoiding the objections of “anything goes” permissiveness, pernicious equivalence, and inconsistency. Knowledge and truth are relative to contexts, but some beliefs can be judged as better or worse based on shared standards internal to those contexts. Conceptual frameworks themselves can also be compared in a relativized fashion. Relativism itself is a theory put forward within a broad philosophical tradition, not as an absolute claim about knowledge across all possible frameworks. With these considerations in mind, ER can be formulated in a modest and coherent fashion.
