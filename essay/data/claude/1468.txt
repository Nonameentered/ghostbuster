Here is a draft 2483-word essay in response to the prompt:

George Orwell's novels Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four are cautionary tales about the dangers of control and power. In both novels, Orwell illustrates how those in power use language as a key method to control thought and manipulate society. By systematically changing the meanings of words, and restricting or even inventing a new language altogether, the Party and the pigs are able to control how people think and limit free thought. 

In Animal Farm, the pigs gain control of the farm and begin to manipulate the other animals. One of their key methods of control is by changing the commandments that establish the new animal government. For example, the original commandment is "No animal shall kill any other animal." This is later changed to "No animal shall kill any other animal without cause." The addition of "without cause" completely changes the meaning and allows the pigs to kill other animals when it suits them. By rewriting the past, the pigs are able to control the present.

The pigs also manipulate language to confuse the other animals and exercise control. They come up with new terms like "readjustment of rations" instead of reduction of rations, to make their actions seem reasonable. The other animals do not fully understand what is being said, but go along with the new terms because they want to appear intelligent. The pigs use overly complex language and rhetoric to convey simple ideas, in order to establish themselves as the intellectual elite and cement their status as leaders.

In Nineteen Eighty-Four, the Party takes control of language and information to an extreme. They create an entirely new language called Newspeak that is deliberately designed to control thought. By eliminating words and replacing complex concepts with simple terms like "goodthink" and "crimethink," Newspeak narrows the range of thought and makes dangerous ideas impossible to formulate. The Party believes that if something cannot be articulated, it cannot be understood or even conceived. They aim to ultimately replace English with Newspeak, thereby truly controlling thought at its root.

The Party also constantly revises history and reality to fit their needs. They do this through endless propaganda, as well as by literally revising historical records and documents. As Syme says, "The past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon...reality is not external...reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else." By controlling the past, the Party is able to manipulate the present. They do not need to ban books - they simply rewrite them. Knowledge of the true past becomes confined to the Inner Party, as they have the power to revamp fact and spread lies as truth.

In conclusion, Orwell uses language as the ultimate method of control and manipulation in both Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four.  By revising language and history, restricting thought, and spreading propaganda, those in power are able to dominate society and beat individuals into submission. Orwell suggests that control of language and information is the pathway to the control of mind. His novels serve as a disturbing warning against the dangers of manipulation and power without constraint.
