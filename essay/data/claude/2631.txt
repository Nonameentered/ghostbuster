Viking ships played a crucial role in enabling the Viking age between the 8th and 11th centuries AD. The Vikings, seafaring Norse explorers and traders from Scandinavia, used their iconic ships for both raiding and trading across wide areas of Europe, as well as exploring into the North Atlantic. Their ships allowed the Vikings to discover and settle new lands, raid coastal settlements, and establish trade networks that spanned from the Byzantine Empire to North America.

Archaeological evidence gives us insight into the design and construction of Viking ships. They were clinker-built, meaning the hull planks overlapped each other and were secured with iron rivets. This made their ships lightweight, flexible, and able to withstand the rough waters of the North Atlantic. The most well-known type of Viking ship was the longship, ranging from 15 to 30 meters in length. Longships were powered by a single square sail and multiple oars, and could reach speeds of up to 15 knots. They were shallow-draft, allowing navigation in rivers and coastal waters.

Viking ships enabled their raiding activities, allowing them to launch surprise attacks on undefended coastal settlements, monasteries and villages. Their speed and mobility meant that Vikings could strike quickly and escape before opponents had time to organize defenses. The shallow draft of their ships meant they could penetrate far inland via rivers. Archaeology provides evidence of Viking raids, including churches and monasteries that were burned and looted. Coins, jewelry, and other artifacts provide evidence of the types of goods the Vikings plundered.

At the same time, Viking ships facilitated trade and exchange over long distances. They established and controlled trade routes across the North Sea and Baltic Sea, trading goods like furs, amber, slaves, and silver. Coins from the Islamic world and Byzantium provide evidence of the vast trade networks the Vikings accessed. Major trade centers included Hedeby, Birka, and York. Treaties like the Treaty of Stralsund in 970 provided terms for peaceful trade between Vikings and other groups.

In sum, Viking ships were instrumental to the Viking age, enabling exploration, raiding, and trading across Europe and into the North Atlantic. Their shipbuilding skills produced seaworthy ships that gave the Vikings superiority at sea and allowed them to prey on coastal and inland settlements across wide areas. At the same time, their ships connected trade networks between the Black Sea, North Sea, and North America, facilitating the exchange of goods, cultures, and ideas over vast distances. Archaeology gives us a glimpse into their ship construction, as well as evidence of their raiding and trading activities, illuminating the crucial role that Viking ships played in their dominance during this period.
