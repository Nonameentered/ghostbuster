Here is a 1500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Political culture refers to the attitudes, beliefs, and values that people in a society hold regarding the political system and its various components. The political culture of a society has a significant impact on the stability and sustainability of a political regime. A political regime is sustainable when it is able to maintain its authority and effectively govern over time. There are a few ways in which political culture influences regime stability and sustainability.

First, a political culture that is congruent and supportive of the fundamental values and institutions of a regime helps legitimize that regime and enhances its stability. When citizens broadly share and endorse the principles that underlie their political system, they are more likely to accept that system as legitimate and authoritative. For example, the American political culture, with its emphasis on liberty, equality, democracy, and constitutionalism, has been highly congruent with the democratic values of the US political system. This has bolstered the legitimacy and stability of the American regime. In contrast, in societies with a culture at odds with regime values, citizens are more prone to protest and unrest, undermining stability. 

Second, political culture shapes how citizens and leaders behave within a political system in ways that can either strengthen or weaken it. A culture that fosters civic participation, moderation, compromise, and loyalty to the system helps sustain a regime. For example, the culture of civic republicanism in the early American republic emphasized citizens' participation and sacrifice for the common good, which supported the fledgling democratic system. In contrast, a culture of extreme partisan divisiveness or apathy can corrode a regime's foundations over time. 

Finally, political culture has an influence on a regime's relationships with other states in the international sphere. A political culture that promotes liberal democratic values of pluralism, peace, and cooperation often leads regimes to build alliances and partnerships abroad that reinforce those values. For example, the democratic culture of the US and Western Europe during the Cold War led those nations to ally under NATO against the threat of Soviet authoritarianism. In contrast, a culture that glorifies aggression, violence, or imperial ambition may lead regimes into adversarial or destabilizing relationships with neighbors.  

In conclusion, political culture and regime stability have a reciprocal relationship. A stable regime fosters the spread of a supportive political culture, but that culture, in turn, strengthens the regime's sustainability. Political culture is shaped by history, religion, education, and media, among other influences. Leaders who wish to build a sustainable regime would do well to consider how to shape a political culture that provides legitimacy and support for the system they aim to build. Overall, the congruence between political culture and regime values, the effect of culture on citizen and elite behavior, and the impact of culture on foreign relations all tie culture closely to the stability of any political system.
