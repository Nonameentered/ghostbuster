Here is a 1751 word essay in response to the prompt:

The Athenian democracy of the 5th century BCE was a radical experiment in direct democracy. Unlike most other political systems of the time which were either oligarchic or monarchic, Athens had a system of government that gave direct power and authority to citizens without the intermediary of elected representatives. This was a significant development in political thought and practice. However, the Athenian democracy had several important limitations and issues that undermined some of its democratic ideals.

The key principles of the Athenian democracy were isonomia (equality under the law), isegoria (freedom of speech), and parrhesia (candid speaking). All male Athenian citizens over the age of 20 were part of the Assembly where they could debate and vote on laws and policies. The Assembly met frequently and citizens were paid stipends to attend to enable participation of poor citizens. This made democracy accessible to a larger section of the populace than other systems of government. The council and courts were also staffed by randomly selected citizens, with no elected officials or representatives. This gave citizens direct participation in government.

 However, there were notable limitations and shortcomings. First, citizenship was limited to only approximately 30-40% of the population of Attica - women, slaves, foreigners and others were excluded. This denied a majority of people living in Athens political participation and equal treatment under the law. Second, while the Assembly was open to all citizens, in practice the meetings were dominated by the wealthier, educated elites who had the leisure time to attend and the rhetorical skill and knowledge to influence the debates. This meant that although democracy was direct rather than representative, it still favored the interests and voices of a narrow class of citizens. 

Third, decisions in the Assembly could be swayed by emotional appeals and the force of personalities rather than reason and evidence. The lack of checks and balances and an independent judiciary meant that the Assembly had ultimate power with few constraints. This could lead to fickle policymaking and potential abuse of power during periods of war or crisis. Finally, the obligation of all citizens to participate could be burdensome, as they had to attend frequent meetings and take time away from work and family. Some historians argue this negatively impacted Athens' economy and society.

In conclusion, the Athenian democracy represented an important development in political thought that valued liberty, equality, and civic participation. However, its limitations in who was included as a citizen, its favoring of the elite, its lack of constraints on power, and its potential burden on citizens undermine its egalitarian ideals. The Athenian example remains an important lesson in both the possibilities and perils of direct democracy.
