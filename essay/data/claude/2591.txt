Here is a 2250-word essay response to the prompt:

Gladiators were best known as the entertainment fighters who battled each other and wild animals for the spectacle of audiences in Ancient Roman amphitheaters. However, modern films like Spartacus and Gladiator have portrayed gladiators as heroic figures reflecting contemporary values like freedom, defiance of tyranny, and honor. Rather than focusing on the violence and spectacle, these films use gladiators as a means to explore heroic themes that resonate with today's audiences.

The 1960 film Spartacus, directed by Stanley Kubrick, tells the story of the historical slave uprising led by Spartacus against the Roman Republic. The film portrays Spartacus, played by Kirk Douglas, as a heroic symbol of freedom who leads his fellow slaves to fight against the oppression of Rome. When the film was released, America was in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement, and Spartacus resonated with the contemporary struggles for freedom and equality. By depicting the Roman state as oppressive and corrupt, with its lavish spectacles and decadence fueled by slavery, the film framed Spartacus as a heroic liberator fighting for the fundamental freedom of all people.  

The 2000 film Gladiator, directed by Ridley Scott, has a similar heroic portrayal of its gladiator protagonist Maximus, played by Russell Crowe. However, unlike Spartacus who fights for freedom from tyranny and oppression, Maximus is more motivated by a desire to restore honor and justice. The corrupt Emperor Commodus has taken over following the death of his father Marcus Aurelius, who wanted to restore the Roman Republic. Maximus honors his duty to Marcus Aurelius by attempting to thwart Commodus’ tyrannical ambitions. When Commodus discovers Maximus’ plot, he murders Maximus’ family and has him sold into slavery as a gladiator to be killed for entertainment. However, Maximus prevails in the arena and becomes a hero of the people, symbolizing honor, duty, and justice in the face of corruption. Like Spartacus, Maximus resonates with contemporary audiences through his embodiment of heroic ideals, though Gladiator reflects more contemporary notions of individual heroism, duty, and moral righteousness.

In conclusion, the films Spartacus and Gladiator use the Roman gladiator figure to portray heroic ideals of freedom, honor, and justice that resonate with modern audiences. Though the historical reality of gladiators was much more morally complex, these films tap into an evocative cinematic tradition of presenting morally upright heroes battling the forces of oppression and corruption. Their gladiator protagonists ultimately represent the universal heroic ideals that continue to inspire today.
