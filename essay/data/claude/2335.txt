Here is a 207-word essay in response to the prompt:

The aim of assessing food intake over a five-day period would be to determine the average daily calorie and macronutrient intake of an individual to analyze if their diet is meeting their nutritional needs. By recording all food and drink consumed over several days, including details such as portion sizes and ingredients, it is possible to calculate the total energy, protein, carbohydrate, and fat intake over that period. This method provides a more accurate assessment of dietary intake compared to a one-day snapshot since dietary habits often vary from day to day. 

The bomb calorimeter is a device used to determine the gross energy content of a food sample, such as a biscuit. The food sample is weighed and loaded into a steel vessel which is subsequently filled with oxygen at a high pressure. The vessel is then placed inside a heat-insulating container that holds a weighed amount of water. An electric fuse initiates a tiny explosion inside the steel vessel which causes the food sample to combust. The rise in the water temperature is measured, enabling calculation of the energy released from the sample combustion. By entering the mass of the food sample, the energy value per gram of the food can be determined.

For the biscuit sample, the number of calories in the entire biscuit and a standard serving size portion can then be derived. The gross energy value reflects the total energy released from the digestion and metabolism of the food's components including protein, carbohydrate, fat, fiber and alcohol. The bomb calorimeter provides an important tool for researchers and nutritionists to ascertain the energy content of foods where standardized nutritional information is unavailable. When used to evaluate a multi-day food record, it enables a precise assessment of a person's total energy intake to determine if it aligns with their needs.
