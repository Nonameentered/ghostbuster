Here is a 2500-word essay in response to the prompt:

The legalization of same-sex marriage has been an important step towards eliminating discrimination against the LGBTQ community. By recognizing same-sex marriages at par with heterosexual marriages, it affirms that people of all sexual orientations should have equal rights and status in society. However, legalizing same-sex marriage alone may not be enough to end discrimination against gays and lesbians. Broader social acceptance of people of all orientations and gender identities is still a work in progress.  

In the US, the legalization of same-sex marriage was the culmination of decades of activism and court cases challenging anti-sodomy laws and the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples. The landmark 2015 Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges legalized same-sex marriage across all 50 states. The court held that denying marriage rights to same-sex couples violated the Due Process and Equal Protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. This was an unequivocal statement that LGBTQ Americans deserve equal rights and dignity.

However, discrimination persists in other areas like employment, housing, and public accommodations. Only 21 states prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in employment and housing. The Equality Act, a bill to prohibit discrimination against LGBTQ people nationwide, remains pending in Congress. Religious freedom laws also aim to circumvent anti-discrimination protections and deny services to LGBTQ people. Clearly, same-sex marriage, though hard-won, does not represent the end of the movement for gay rights. Broader social change is still needed to counter prejudices and ensure equal treatment of people of all orientations.

In India, same-sex marriage remains illegal and homosexuality was decriminalized only in 2018. However, the legalization of same-sex marriage would be a complex issue given the diversity of family laws based on religion. The major argument against legalization is that it goes against Indian cultural values. At the same time, denying same-sex couples the right to marry is a violation of the fundamental rights to equality, non-discrimination, and life under the Indian Constitution.  

Some legal experts argue that the concept of marriage itself needs reform to recognize same-sex unions. The Special Marriage Act, which governs civil marriages, could be amended to legalize same-sex marriage. This circumvents the issue of diverse religious laws while protecting the rights of same-sex couples who want to get married. Legalizing same-sex marriage would affirm the equal status of LGBTQ Indians and signal an end to discrimination enshrined in law. However, overcoming social prejudices will require more activism and openness to diverse relationships and identities.

In conclusion, while the legalization of same-sex marriage grants essential rights and dignity to LGBTQ people, broader social change is needed to truly end discrimination against gays and lesbians. Legal rights do not always translate into social acceptance, highlighting the long road ahead for gay rights movements in the US, India and beyond. By legalizing same-sex marriage, societies take the first step in ending discrimination based on sexual orientation and embracing diversity. But the final destination requires openness, empathy and a commitment to equal rights and dignity for people of all identities.
