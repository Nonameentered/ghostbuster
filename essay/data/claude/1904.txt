Here is a 1000 word essay in response to the prompt:

The Riesling grape has several characteristics that make it well suited for producing high quality wines in certain areas of the world. Riesling thrives in cooler climate regions where it can develop its distinctive aromatic and flavor profile. The grape demands significant sunlight and warmth but also abundant acidity to balance its natural sugars. It requires well-drained soils with minerals such as slate that impart complex flavors. 

Riesling wines exhibit floral notes of honey, citrus, and stone fruit. They tend to be light to medium bodied with high acidity. Riesling's characteristics vary based on regional climate and soil. In cooler areas like Germany, Alsace, and Austria, Riesling produces crisp, fruity wines with pronounced minerality. The soils in these areas contain slate and quartz which lend flavors of wet stones. The warmer Wachau region of Austria produces fuller-bodied Rieslings with tones of apricot and peach. 

Some of the world's finest sweet Rieslings come from Germany, especially the Mosel and Rheingau regions. These wines have a perfect balance of sugar and acid and age for decades while maintaining freshness. They offer flavors of honeysuckle, ripe apricot, and lemon curd. The cooler climate prevents over-ripening so the wines retain bright acidity. The mineral-rich slate soils provide an ideal counterpart to the ripe fruit flavors.  

In contrast, Riesling grown in warmer New World regions like Australia tend to produce simpler wines lacking in complexity. Without abundant acidity and minerality, the wines end up flabby and one-dimensional. They rely primarily on grapefruit, lime, and generic tropical fruit notes. These wines lack the finesse, elegance, and longevity of their Old World counterparts.

In summary, the Riesling grape has characteristics that suit it ideally to certain cool climate, mineral-rich regions where it can produce wines of unmatched quality, complexity, and longevity. Soil type, climate, and regional variation have a substantial effect on Riesling's aromatic and flavor profile as well as a wine's ability to age gracefully. When these factors are optimized, Riesling can yield some of the finest sweet and dry white wines in the world.
