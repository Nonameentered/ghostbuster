What factors contributed to the slow economic progress of East Asia compared to Europe during the early modern period? 

During the early modern period from the 15th to 18th centuries, Europe experienced massive economic growth and development that led to the rise of global European empires. In contrast, East Asian economies like China and Japan grew at a much slower pace during the same period. There were several key factors that contributed to the divergent economic trajectories of Europe and East Asia in the early modern era:

Political Fragmentation vs. Centralization. Europe in the early modern period was highly politically fragmented, with many small independent states and principalities. This fragmentation encouraged competition between states, loosened the constraints on merchants and traders, and accelerated the diffusion of new ideas. In contrast, East Asian states like the Ming and Qing dynasties in China and the Tokugawa shogunate in Japan were highly centralized. While political stability enabled long periods of peace, the centralized control also placed greater restrictions on trade and commerce.  The state monopolized key industries and strictly controlled domestic and foreign merchants. This stifled incentives for innovation and economic risk-taking.

Scientific Revolution vs. Intellectual Stagnation. The Scientific Revolution in Europe led to new theories and discoveries in fields like physics, astronomy, and chemistry. This spirit of open intellectual inquiry and empiricism promoted an experimental mindset that spurred new inventions and technologies. In contrast, the prevailing Neo-Confucian ideologies in Ming China and Tokugawa Japan were more dogmatic and anti-scientific. They emphasized tradition, hierarchy, and the importance of canonical texts over empiricism. This intellectual conservatism hindered the development and diffusion of new scientific knowledge and technologies that could drive economic growth.

Colonialism and Global Trade vs Isolationism. European colonization of the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa led to the accumulation of wealth through plunder and the development of new global trade networks. The influx of gold and silver from the colonies also spurred inflation in Europe, which encouraged the growth of banking and finance. In contrast, the Ming and Tokugawa governments adopted isolationist foreign policies that restricted overseas trade and colonization. While limiting some social disruptions, these policies also prevented East Asian merchants and states from tapping into the expanding global trade networks and accumulating capital through colonial activities. 

In summary, the political fragmentation, scientific progress, and colonial expansion in Europe created conditions ripe for rapid economic change. In contrast, the political centralization, intellectual conservatism, and isolationism of major East Asian states like China and Japan hindered economic dynamism and caused their economies to stagnate relative to the massive leaps in Europe during the early modern era. The three factors I highlighted were key in contributing to the slow economic progress of East Asia vis-Ã -vis the economic ascendance of Europe from 1500 to 1800.
