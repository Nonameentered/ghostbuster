The railroad was instrumental in transforming Atlantic City into a popular tourist destination in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Prior to the railroad, Atlantic City was a small coastal town with an economy based primarily on fishing and beachgoing for local visitors. The arrival of the railroad in 1854 connected Atlantic City to Philadelphia and New York, opening it up to many more potential visitors. Atlantic City quickly became a fashionable beach resort, attracting wealthy urbanites looking to escape the summer heat.

The ease of rail travel and inexpensive fares allowed middle-class families to also flock to Atlantic City's beach and boardwalk. Special excursion trains and discounted travel packages made trips to the shore affordable and accessible. The railroad companies heavily promoted Atlantic City as a desirable summer destination, emphasizing its beach, hotels, and amusements. They marketed the town as an exotic escape from city life, despite its proximity to major urban centers.

The railroad was transformative for Atlantic City's economy and development. Mass tourism spurred a hotel boom, with lavish resorts like the Marlborough-Blenheim attracting guests. Amusement piers with rollercoasters, Ferris wheels, and games were built to keep visitors entertained. Retailers, restaurants, and entertainment venues sprouted up along the bustling boardwalk. Atlantic City became known as "The World's Playground" due to the range of attractions and leisure activities. For decades, the resort town thrived thanks to the streams of tourists arriving by rail.

More broadly, the railroad revolutionized American culture in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It enabled faster travel over longer distances, connecting people in new ways. The railroad gave rise to new towns and cities across the country, as the paths of rail lines shaped patterns of settlement and commerce. Migrants could now easily move out West in search of economic opportunity.

The railroad also fostered the spread of cultural influences between cities and regions. Musical styles, fashions, foods, and slang were transported up and down rail lines, spread by travelers and popular culture. The Chautauqua movement used rail circuits to bring educational and cultural programs to rural audiences.

Travelling by train became deeply embedded in American life, reflected in music, art, film, and literature. The power, speed, and sweeping vistas of long-distance rail travel inspired a sense of technological wonder, freedom of movement, and a fast-changing landscape. The golden age of rail travel in the U.S. was a formative experience for generations of Americans, shaping both national identity and personal memories.

In conclusion, the railroad was the driving force behind Atlantic City's rise as a quintessential American beach resort. More broadly, the railroad transformed patterns of settlement, commerce, and culture in the U.S. in the 19th and 20th centuries. The widespread access to travel it afforded connected Americans in new ways and spread cultural influences between cities and regions. For many, train travel represented the excitement and adventure of a fast-changing nation. The legacy of the railroad lives on in the growth and character of cities like Atlantic City, and in the nostalgia for a golden age of rail travel that shaped America.
