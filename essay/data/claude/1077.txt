Here is a 1500 word essay in response to the prompt:

The Private Language Argument poses significant difficulties for Descartes' philosophy and his conception of the mind. In his Meditations, Descartes argues that we have privileged access to our own minds through introspection. We have a clear and distinct understanding of our own internal mental states and ideas. However, the Private Language Argument, as put forth by Ludwig Wittgenstein, challenges this notion. 

Wittgenstein argues that a private language, a language that refers to private internal sensations that only the individual can understand, is incoherent. For a language and the concepts it expresses to have meaning, there must be some way to determine correctness - some way to test whether a word is being used properly. However, for a sensation that is utterly private and internal, there is no way to test or verify whether a word refers to that sensation. The individual could be mistaken or confused, and no one would ever know.

For Descartes, our knowledge of our own minds through introspection is clear and distinct. But Wittgenstein argues this is not possible with a private, inner sensation or experience. We have no way of knowing whether we are using words correctly to refer to our own inner mental states. We can be mistaken, and since no one else has access, no one can verify or confirm. This undermines Descartes' claim that we have a kind of perfect, clear knowledge of our own minds just through introspection. Our access to our own minds is not necessarily transparent or incorrigible.

The Private Language Argument also undercuts Descartes' argument for dualism - the existence of an immaterial mind or soul separate from the physical body. Descartes believes we know we have a non-physical mind through introspection, as we perceive clearly and distinctly that our thoughts, sensations, and consciousness are completely different from physical objects. But if we have no way to verify that we are using mental concepts correctly or accurately identifying inner experiences, then we cannot come to clear and distinct understandings of the nature of the mind through introspection alone. Our knowledge of our own mental states would be subject to the same uncertainties and possibilities of error as our knowledge of anything else.

In conclusion, the Private Language Argument poses major problems for Descartes' philosophy that relies so heavily on transparency of mind and the ability to gain a perfect, clear and distinct understanding of the inner self through introspection alone. If Wittgenstein is right that a private language and private sensations are incoherent, then Descartes' claims about knowledge of our own minds are seriously undermined. Our access to our own minds is not as perfect or transparent as Descartes believes, and this threatens his arguments for dualism as well as his broader conception of the mind and knowledge. The Private Language Argument essentially closes the door to the inner chamber of our minds that Descartes believes we have a clear view into through introspection.
