The period from 200,000 years ago to 30,000 years ago, encompassing part of the Pleistocene epoch, experienced significant fluctuations in the climate. This period saw multiple glacial-interglacial cycles that had major impacts on landscapes and sea levels, as well as the flora and fauna. To understand the climate during this period, scientists rely on multiple proxies like ice cores, marine sediments, speleothems, and terrestrial paleoecological records. 

Around 200,000 years ago, the Earth was in an interglacial period called the Late Pleistocene Warm Stage. The climate was relatively warm and sea levels were high. However, between 190,000 to 130,000 years ago, there were multiple phases of glaciation, termed as the Late Saalian glaciation in Europe, with the expansion of ice sheets and a drop in sea levels. The warmest interglacial period after that was the Eemian interglacial from 130,000 to 115,000 years ago. The climate was a few degrees warmer than today, and hippopotamuses and water buffalos inhabited London.

 From 115,000 to 12,000 years ago, there were multiple phases of glaciation in the Weichselian Ice Age or last glacial period in Europe. The glacial phases like the Early, Middle, and Late Weichselian saw the growth of massive ice sheets, especially the Eurasian ice sheet over northern Europe, and the Laurentide ice sheet over Canada and parts of the northern U.S. Sea levels dropped by up to 120 meters. The landscape was tundra-like, and inhabitants included woolly mammoths, saber-toothed cats, cave bears, etc. The interstadial periods within Weichselian, like the Bølling-Allerød, saw warmer climate and the expansion of forests. 

Within this period, Homo sapiens and Neanderthals inhabited parts of Europe and western Asia. Neanderthals were physically adapted to survive the harsh glacial climate. They had stocky and muscular bodies, which helped in keeping warm. The large nose and nasal passages also helped humidify and warm the cold air. Neanderthals may have hunted large mammals like bison, reindeer, deer, etc. for their meat, fur, and skins. The intermittent interstadial periods and climate warming could have provided opportunities for cultural and technological development. However, Neanderthals eventually went extinct around 40,000 years ago due to environmental changes and competition from modern humans.

In summary, the period from 200,000 to 30,000 years ago saw major shifts between colder glacial and warmer interglacial climates. Glacial periods saw the growth of massive ice sheets, drops in sea level, and spread of tundra-like environments, while interglacials were characterized by warmer climate and forest expansion. Neanderthals were physiologically adapted to survive the cold glacial climate, though ultimately went extinct likely due to environmental and competitive factors. Climate reconstruction for this period depends on proxies like ice cores, marine sediments, cave deposits, tree rings, etc. Overall, this period witnessed substantial changes in climate and environments in Europe and western Asia.
