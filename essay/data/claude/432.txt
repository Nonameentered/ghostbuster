Influenza A viruses are a group of viruses that comprise the Influenza A genus in the Orthomyxoviridae virus family. These viruses are extremely contagious and can cause severe respiratory illness in both humans and animals. Influenza A viruses have several characteristics that make them dangerous pathogens:

First, Influenza A viruses have a segmented genome consisting of 8 separate RNA strands that encode for 11 known proteins. This segmented genome allows for genetic reassortment when multiple Influenza A subtypes infect the same host cell. Such reassortment can lead to the emergence of new viral strains for which humans may have little pre-existing immunity. This process, known as antigenic shift, enables Influenza A viruses to cause influenza pandemics with high mortality.

Second, Influenza A viruses are prone to frequent mutations due to the lack of proofreading activity of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This leads to the accumulation of minor mutations from year to year, a process known as antigenic drift. Antigenic drift causes small changes to the virus's surface antigens, named hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), enabling the virus to evade the human immune system and re-infect people who were infected with prior strains. Due to antigenic drift, Influenza A viruses cause annual seasonal influenza epidemics that contribute to severe disease and death. 

Laboratory assays are essential for characterizing Influenza A viruses and monitoring their evolution.  Methods such as isolation, propagation and serotyping of viral isolates allow for identification and classification of new viral strains. Genetic sequencing of the virus's HA and NA genes can identify mutations indicative of antigenic drift and the emergence of antigenically distinct strains. Hemagglutination inhibition assays measure the ability of antibodies to prevent viral isolates from binding red blood cells, enabling determination of the antigenic relatedness between viral strains. Such analyses inform annual selection of influenza vaccine strains to ensure vaccines will be optimally effective against circulating viruses.

In summary, Influenza A viruses are highly contagious respiratory pathogens with a unique capacity for rapid evolution and generation of novel strains. Their segmented genome and lack of proofreading activity lead to frequent genetic reassortment and drift, enabling both periodic pandemics and seasonal epidemics of influenza disease. Laboratory characterization of Influenza A viruses through isolation, antigenic typing, genetic sequencing and hemagglutination inhibition assays is critical for monitoring viral evolution and selection of optimal vaccine candidates. These properties combined make Influenza A viruses a persistent and significant threat to human health.
