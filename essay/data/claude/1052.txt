Learning a foreign language is challenging and requires dedication, persistence, and the right approach. My attempts to learn Persian were largely unsuccessful due to the lack of key factors that facilitate language learning: motivation, comprehensible input, and negotiated output.

Motivation is essential for learning a new language. Without a strong motivation to learn the language, it is difficult to maintain consistency and put in the necessary effort. My motivation to learn Persian was primarily academic and superficial. I was not deeply interested in Persian culture, history or connecting with Persian speakers. This lack of genuine motivation and passion for the language made it hard to stay committed to learning during times of difficulty or frustration. To improve, finding ways to spark a personal interest and connection with the language and culture could have helped strengthen my motivation.

Comprehensible input refers to language input that is slightly beyond one's current level of understanding but is made understandable through context and extra linguistic information. My Persian learning experience lacked comprehensible input. The materials and resources I used, primarily textbooks, were not engaging and contained inauthentic language that was detached from real meaning. Without input that captures one's interest and is conveyed in a comprehensible, meaningful way, learning is ineffective. Accessing more compelling and culturally rich input, such as music, movies, stories and podcasts, could have enhanced my learning. 

Negotiated output refers to language production that is meaningful and conveys an actual message. It involves trial and error and adjusting one's speech based on feedback. I had little opportunity to engage in negotiated output while learning Persian. I focused mostly on grammar drills and memorization, rather than speaking and writing. Speaking with others, either face to face or online, and keeping a written journal are ways I could have incorporated more negotiated output into my learning process.

In summary, my attempts to learn Persian were unsuccessful primarily due to lack of motivation, comprehensible input, and negotiated output. Approaching the learning experience with a deeper personal interest, accessing more compelling and culturally meaningful input, and increasing opportunities for authentic speaking and writing could have significantly improved my learning process and progress. With the right approach and resources, learning a new language is achievable.
