Sensory profiling is a technique used to assess the sensory properties of a product through descriptive analysis by a trained panel of evaluators. The goal of sensory profiling is to obtain a comprehensive and quantitative description of a product based on the perceptions and experiences of human senses. 

In a study to compare four brands of milk chocolate, sensory profiling was used to evaluate and compare the sensory characteristics of each product. The four brands included Brand A, a premium Swiss chocolate; Brand B, a mainstream chocolate; and two store brand chocolates, Brand C and Brand D.

The first step in the process was to recruit evaluators for the sensory panel. A group of 30 evaluators with an interest in chocolate sensory analysis were selected. These evaluators went through intensive training to become familiar with the attributes and scale to be used in the evaluation. The evaluators learned to focus on the aroma, taste, texture, and aftertaste when analyzing the chocolates.

A list of 19 attributes was developed to describe the sensory properties of the chocolates. Some of the attributes included: chocolate aroma, sweet aroma, cocoa flavor, sweetness, bitterness, smoothness, hardness, and aftertaste duration. For each attribute, a rating scale was provided for the evaluators, ranging from 0 (none) to 100 (prominent). 

For the evaluation, each evaluator received samples of the four brands of milk chocolate at the same time but with codes to avoid bias. They rated the intensity of each of the 19 attributes for each chocolate sample based on their perceptions. The evaluators also provided an overall rating for each chocolate to indicate how well they liked the sample. 

The results of the sensory profiling revealed distinctive profiles for each of the four brands of chocolate. In general, the premium Brand A was characterized by strong cocoa and chocolate aromas and flavors. It received high ratings for bitterness and aftertaste. In contrast, the mainstream Brand B had mild aromas and was perceived as overly sweet with little bitterness. The two store brands, Brand C and Brand D, lacked strong defining characteristics and were quite variable in their ratings.

Based on the sensory profiles and hedonic ratings, Brand A was perceived as a rich, flavorful chocolate targeted for those preferring a dark, bitter chocolate. Brand B was a mild, sweet chocolate for the general consumer market. Brand C and Brand D lacked a consistent product and quality. Sensory profiling provided insights into the attributes driving consumer preferences and perceptions of quality for the chocolates. With this information, manufacturers could determine appropriate marketing strategies or make improvements to their products.

In summary, sensory profiling uses a trained panel of evaluators to systematically characterize and quantify the sensory properties of a product. By evaluating multiple attributes and providing a sensory profile for different product samples, sensory profiling achieves an in-depth understanding of how the products are perceived and differ based on sensory characteristics. For the milk chocolate study, it revealed distinct profiles for four brands and useful information on consumer preferences. Sensory profiling is a valuable tool for product developers, market researchers, and manufacturers.
