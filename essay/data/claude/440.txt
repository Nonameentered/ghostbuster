The extent to which Britain's commercial empire depended on slavery in the eighteenth century was the subject of considerable debate among historians. Early historians such as Eric Williams argued that slavery and the slave trade were crucial to Britain's economic development and industrialization. However, more recent historians such as Kenneth Morgan have challenged this view, arguing that slavery was not essential and that its contribution was marginal relative to other factors.

Eric Williams' seminal 1944 work Capitalism and Slavery argued that profits from the slave trade and slavery directly contributed to Britain's industrialization by providing capital for investment in industry. The slave trade triangle between Britain, West Africa, and the Caribbean generated economic activity and profits in British ports that were then invested in industrial enterprises. Additionally, raw materials from slave plantations such as cotton, tobacco, and sugar fueled British industry. Williams claimed that "slavery was not a sideshow in the growth of capitalism but was a crucial factor." His argument implied Britain was heavily dependent on slavery for commercial and economic expansion.

Subsequent historians challenged Williams' thesis. They argued that the profits from slavery and the slave trade, while substantial, were not unique and that other trades also generated profits for investment. Kenneth Morgan estimated the slave trade contributed less than 5% of Britain's national income, showing its marginal economic impact. Critics also noted Britain had alternative sources for raw materials and that the slave trade was not essential for the growth of ports or commerce. The industrial revolution, they argued, would have proceeded without the contributions from slavery. 

More recent studies have adopted a more balanced view, acknowledging the role of slavery in British commerce but also recognizing Britain was not wholly dependent on it. Slavery and the slave trade were important parts of transatlantic trade networks that fostered economic activity, but Britain had a diversified, global trading empire. British merchants were adept at shifting between different trades to generate profits. While industries like cotton manufacturing relied on raw materials from slave plantations, Britain also imported cotton from other sources. Profits from slavery contributed to investment pools, but so did other maritime and commercial enterprises.

In conclusion, while slavery and the slave trade were integral to Britain's commercial empire and economic interests in the eighteenth century, Britain was not wholly dependent on them. Other trades and raw material sources contributed substantially to British commerce and industrialization. Recent historical interpretations recognize that while slavery was important, its role has sometimes been exaggerated relative to other factors that drove British economic ascent. A balanced analysis shows how profits from slavery contributed to and reinforced Britain's expanding global trade and economic development without constituting the sole or primary factor responsible for its commercial and industrial rise. Overall, Britain benefitted greatly from slavery and the slave trade, but its commercial empire did not fundamentally depend on them.
