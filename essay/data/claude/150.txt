Political power is one of the most debated and contested concepts in political science. There are many theories that attempt to explain the nature and distribution of power in society, ranging from pluralist theories that envision power as widely dispersed to elitist theories that see power as concentrated in the hands of a few. According to Stoker and Marsh, the general consensus is that there is no single theory that can fully capture the complexity of political power. Instead, most modern analyses incorporate elements of both pluralism and elitism.

Pluralist theories, advocated by scholars like Robert Dahl, argue that power is distributed widely in western democracies instead of concentrated in the hands of a ruling elite. Dahl proposes that a multiplicity of groups and interests compete in the policy process, and politicians must be responsive to citizens and interest groups to get elected and stay in office. Power is therefore dispersed and fluid. Dahl's analysis has been criticized, however, for painting too optimistic a picture of power distribution and overlooking instances of "non-decision making" where issues are kept off the political agenda. Bachrach and Baratz argue that power also involves influencing what is not discussed or decided. If certain interests are able to control what issues make it onto the political agenda, that is also an exercise of power. The pluralist conception cannot account for these hidden mechanisms of power.  

In contrast, elitist theories like those of Mosca and Mills argue that power is concentrated within a relatively small ruling elite in society. The elite are able to dominate politics through their control of scare resources, wealth, connections, and information. While electoral democracy gives citizens the opportunity to vote, real power lies in the hands of business executives, military leaders, and other elites. These theories have been criticized for portraying power in simplistic terms and failing to recognize that elites also rely on popular support to exercise power. Most modern analyses argue that power is neither fully concentrated nor fully dispersed, but held by shifting coalitions of elites and counter-elites, with influence that depends on a variety of institutional and social factors.

In conclusion, as Stoker and Marsh point out, the general consensus is that power is a complex social phenomenon that cannot be reduced to a single theory. Pluralist theories correctly identify that power is in some ways dispersed in democracies, while elitist theories also rightly point out that powerful elites are able to exert considerable control over politics behind the scenes. A full understanding of political power requires synthesizing these perspectives and examining how power operates in society through both visible and hidden mechanisms. Power travels in multiple directions - not just from top to bottom or bottom to top, but also horizontally and diagonally across networks. It is a dynamic, rather than static concept that political scientists will continue exploring and contesting. Overall, political power depends on a variety of contextual factors, and there will never be a "one-size-fits-all" theory that defines it.
