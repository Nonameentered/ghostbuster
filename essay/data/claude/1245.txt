The objective of a laboratory session involving tensile testing of biomaterials using a materials testing machine is to determine the mechanical properties of the materials, such as yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, elastic modulus, and ductility. These properties are measured through the application of an increasing tensile load to the material and recording the resulting deformation or strain.  

The tensile testing process begins with sample preparation. The material is cut into dog-bone shaped samples with uniform cross-sectional area. The samples are then mounted in grips that hold them securely in the tensile testing machine while allowing unrestricted longitudinal deformation. An initial applied tensile load is recorded using a load cell. As the load increases at a constant strain rate, the change in gauge length of the sample is recorded using an extensometer to determine the stress-strain curve.

The stress-strain curve reflects the material's mechanical response to the applied tensile stress. The slope of the initial linear portion of the curve gives the elastic modulus. The point of deviation from linearity indicates the yield point, and the maximum point on the curve represents the ultimate tensile strength. The area under the curve represents the energy absorbed by the material up to failure. The total elongation at failure represents the ductility of the material.  

Several factors can affect the nature and properties of the stress-strain curve. Heat treatment such as annealing can alter the microstructure and produce a ductile curve with a high elongation at failure for metallic materials. Prior plastic deformation causes work hardening which increases the strength but decreases ductility. Faster strain rates produce higher strength but less elongation due to less time for material deformation. Testing at higher temperatures typically decreases strength and increases ductility. These factors must be considered when interpreting and comparing stress-strain curves for different materials.

Some limitations include sample preparation which can introduce defects, improper alignment in the machine which can cause non-uniform deformation, and equipment compliance which can lead to inaccurate strain measurements at high stresses. Operator errors and data acquisition issues can also compromise the results. Standards for sample geometry, testing procedures, and calibration help minimize errors, but perfection is hard to achieve in practice. Statistical analysis of repeat tests provides an estimate of the margin of error.

In summary, tensile testing of biomaterials provides crucial insights into their mechanical performance by measuring key properties obtained from their stress-strain curves. An understanding of how various factors affect these curves enables thorough analysis and comparison of different materials for their potential applications. However, the testing process has certain limitations that must be considered when interpreting the results.
