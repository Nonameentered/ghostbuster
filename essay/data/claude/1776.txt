Compare and Contrast Language Use and Exploration of Understanding/ Power in Texts 

Language is a powerful tool that shapes how we understand the world and interact with one another. Two texts that explore how language is linked to understanding and power in interesting ways are a dialogue between inhabitants of Earth and Mercury by the philosopher Gottfried Leibniz and the poem "Listen Mr Oxford don" by John Agard. While the genres and contexts of these texts differ, they both use language in thought-provoking ways to examine themes of understanding, power, and cross-cultural communication.

The dialogue between the Earth and Mercury inhabitants, written in 1710, takes the form of a philosophical thought experiment. Leibniz imagines how language might differ between humans and inhabitants of Mercury, and how this could impact mutual understanding and power dynamics. Because the Mercurians live in a world where everything moves swiftly, Leibniz hypothesizes their language would reflect this by lacking grammatical features like nouns and consist mainly of verbs. The dialogue shows how this could create misunderstandings between Earthians and Mercurians. For example, when the Earthian says "We spirits...govern the world," the Mercurian thinks the Earthian is claiming to control the physical movement of the world, not spiritually or metaphorically govern. However, Leibniz suggests that with patience and open-mindedness, the vast differences in language and cognition between the inhabitants could be overcome through a "universal characteristic" that links ideas. Overall, Leibniz uses this imaginary dialogue to propose that understanding between very different beings is possible if they can grasp the connection between language and thought. 

In contrast, Agard's poem "Listen Mr Oxford don" examines how language can be used to exclude and diminish understanding between groups of humans. The poem adopts a defiant stance against the prescriptive authority of "Mr Oxford don" - a metaphor for institutional gatekeepers of language and culture. Agard incorporates Creole and rhythmic elements into standard English to celebrate the ability of language to evolve based on how people actually use it. For example, he writes "I building language / I tuning tongue" to assert the value of linguistic innovation over rigid rules. By dismissing dictionary-defined English and reclaiming language as an expressive tool, Agard challenges the power dynamics that favor certain forms of English over others. However, his mixing of registers and rhythms also allows for new understandings between groups, showing how language can be emancipatory when freed from strict conventions.

In conclusion, while the Leibniz dialogue focuses on imagined cross-cultural communication across a vast difference and Agard's poem tackles divisions between human groups, both texts highlight how language can be intertwined with understanding and power. They suggest that inflexible language conventions can diminish understanding and reinforce unequal power structures, but that an open and adaptable approach to language has liberating potential to foster new connections between beings - whether human or not. Overall, these thought-provoking texts show language as a pivotal tool that shapes realities and relationships in profound ways.
