Here is a draft 1500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Observational studies and survey research are two of the most common methods used in the social sciences to gather data about human behaviors, opinions, and characteristics. However, there are some key differences in the ethical concerns and validity of the information provided by these two approaches. 

Observational studies involve observing human subjects in their natural environments and recording data about their behaviors and interactions. The key ethical concern with observational studies is that they are conducted without the explicit consent of the participants. The subjects are unaware that they are being observed and studied. This covert nature of observational studies raises concerns about privacy and consent. The researchers are gathering personal data about individuals without their permission. Some argue this violates the basic ethical principles of respect for persons and informed consent.

On the other hand, survey research relies on self-reported data from subjects who knowingly consent to participate in the research study. Researchers gather information from subjects through questionnaires, interviews, or other survey instruments. While this addresses the ethical concerns of privacy and consent that apply to observational studies, survey research introduces other validity issues. Self-reported data from surveys may be inaccurate due to poor recall, misunderstanding of questions, or a desire to present oneself in a particular light. Respondents may feel compelled to provide socially desirable responses rather than honest ones. 

In terms of validity, observational studies allow researchers to gather data on actual behaviors as they occur naturally, rather than relying on subjects’ potentially inaccurate accounts of their behaviors and thoughts. Observational studies maximize ecological validity, capturing human subjects acting spontaneously in their usual environments. However, the Hawthorne effect suggests that subjects may behave differently simply due to the awareness of being observed, which can undermine validity.

On the other hand, survey research relies entirely on the responses and accounts provided by the subjects themselves. While researchers can increase validity by carefully crafting questions, controlling for various biases, and triangulating data from multiple sources, there is no way to determine if the self-reported data accurately reflects the subjects’ true behaviors, experiences or opinions. Subjects may feel compelled to respond in ways they feel are more socially desirable or that make them seem more “normal.”

In conclusion, while observational studies and survey research are two of the most useful tools in the social sciences, they each have their own unique set of ethical concerns and threats to validity. Observational studies raise issues of privacy but provide data on actual behaviors, while surveys rely on self-reported data that may or may not accurately reflect the truth. Researchers must carefully weigh these factors and take appropriate steps to minimize ethical and validity issues regardless of their chosen method. Overall, a multi-method approach that combines these tools may provide the most robust results.
