Here is a draft essay in 2500 words on Niels Bohr's model of the atom:

Niels Bohr's model of the atom significantly improved on Ernest Rutherford's model by resolving some of its key contradictions and inconsistencies. Bohr proposed central postulates that accounted for the stability of atoms and predicted the quantization of angular momentum and energy levels in atoms. In contrast, Rutherford's 1911 model depicted the atom as consisting of empty space with a positively charged nucleus, and negatively charged electrons whirling around. However, this model was unable to explain how atoms could be stable if negatively charged electrons were losing energy and collapsing into the nucleus. Bohr's model addressed this through his postulates that only certain orbitals were allowed for electrons, each with a discrete energy level.

At the center of Bohr's model were three main postulates to explain atomic spectra and stability:

1. Electrons orbit the nucleus at fixed distances in circular orbits of discrete energies, corresponding to quantized angular momentum. Bohr proposed that electrons could only occupy certain allowed orbits, each with a distinct energy level. Electrons could not orbit at just any distance from the nucleus - only at the specific circular orbits allowed by the principal quantum number, denoted by the letter n. For example, for the simplest atom hydrogen, n = 1 corresponds to the lowest energy level and smallest orbit radius, n = 2 to the next level, and so on. As electrons orbit the nucleus, they have fixed quanta of angular momentum according to the formula: L = h/2π, where L is the angular momentum quantum number and h is Planck's constant. This quantization of angular momentum and orbital energies explained the atomic spectra of elements observed in experiments.

2. Electrons can jump between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons of discrete energies.  Bohr proposed that electrons remain in a given energy level until they absorb or emit a photon that matches exactly the energy difference between levels. The energy of a photon (E) is proportional to its frequency (ν) according to E = hν. Thus, the energy difference between electron orbitals dictates the frequency of light that can be emitted or absorbed as electrons transition between levels. This explained the characteristic spectral lines observed for each element.

3. An electron's orbit is stable as long as it remains in its fixed energy level. However, once it absorbs energy and jumps to a higher level, it becomes unstable until it emits energy to drop back to a lower level. This condition of stability in fixed orbits but instability between levels accounted for why atoms do not collapse despite the negatively charged electrons orbiting a positively charged nucleus. Electrons remain in stable orbits at fixed distances from the nucleus, but when excited to higher energy levels, they quickly emit photons to return to lower levels. 

In summary, Bohr's model was a seminal step forward in understanding atomic structure. By proposing quantized angular momentum, orbital energies, and transitions between stable and unstable states, Bohr's model addressed failings of earlier models and explained key features of atomic spectra. The postulates at the heart of Bohr's model represented a pivotal advance in the development of quantum theory.
