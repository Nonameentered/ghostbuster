There has been a steady decline in voter turnout in Britain at all levels of government over the last several decades. Voter turnout for general elections in Britain reached a post-war low of 59% in 2001, and local election turnout in some areas has dipped below 30% in recent years. This declining voter participation is indicative of a changing nature of democracy in Britain that is leading to a "democratic deficit." 

Several factors have contributed to declining voter turnout in Britain. One of the most significant factors is growing voter apathy and cynicism towards politics and politicians. There is a perception that politicians are out of touch with average citizens and their day to day concerns. Scandals and expenses controversies involving Members of Parliament have exacerbated this cynicism. Many voters feel that politics has become too consumed by spin and image, rather than substantive policy debates. This has turned many voters off from participating in the process.

A second factor is the increasing complexity and technocratic nature of policy issues. Many policy areas like the economy, the environment, and foreign affairs have become quite complex. This makes it difficult for average citizens to understand policy choices and the implications of issues. When voters do not feel well-informed about issues or choices, they are less inclined to vote. There is a sense that many policy decisions are being made by technocratic elites, rather than average citizens. This contributes to the "democratic deficit."

Another significant factor is the decline of class-based voting in Britain. Traditionally, social class was a strong determinant of voting behavior, with working class voters supporting Labour and middle/upper class voters supporting the Conservatives. However, class allegiances have weakened in recent decades. This has made voter choice more complex and unpredictable. Without the cue of social class, some voters struggle to determine which party or policies align best with their interests. This additional effort required to make a choice may discourage some from voting altogether.

In conclusion, declining voter turnout in Britain is a result of a combination of factors including growing voter apathy and cynicism, increasing policy complexity, and the decline of class-based voting. Together, these factors indicate that democracy in Britain is changing, with average citizens becoming more disconnected and disaffected from the political process. Rebuilding connections between politicians and citizens will be crucial to reversing the trend of declining political participation and addressing Britain's "democratic deficit." Overall, greater effort will be needed to make politics and policy choices more accessible, relevant and meaningful to citizens in order to encourage more widespread democratic participation.
