The two central theories of price determination are mark-up pricing and bargaining theory. Mark-up pricing focuses on firms setting prices as a fixed margin or ‘mark-up’ over marginal costs. In this theory, import prices are seen as exogenous factors that affect marginal costs and are thus passed through to consumer prices. In contrast, bargaining theory sees prices as the outcome of negotiations between firms and workers over wages and firms and consumers over product prices. Here, import prices can directly influence the bargaining power and negotiated outcomes of various parties. 

Bargaining coordination refers to the degree of organization and cooperation between parties in price and wage negotiations. Higher coordination can lead to higher mark-ups and wages, as it enhances the bargaining power of firms and workers. Theoretically, coordination should be included as an explanatory variable in mark-up equations because it represents an important institutional factor that shapes pricing power beyond simply market structure or competitive conditions.

Nunziata’s findings suggest that collective bargaining and wage-setting institutions are major determinants of labor costs and wages in OECD countries. Countries with highly coordinated wage bargaining tend to have higher wages, as coordination counterbalances the competitive pressures that would otherwise lead to lower wages. These results highlight the importance of bargaining power and institutions in the price and wage formation process.

Ashworth’s analysis of 13 OECD countries from 1970 to 1990 provides evidence that mark-ups are pro-cyclical, rising during economic expansions. This contradicts the traditional assumption that mark-ups remain stable or even decline during upswings due to competitive pressures. The pro-cyclical nature suggests that rising demand during expansions strengthens firms’ pricing power and mark-ups.

Finally, Chevalier’s research calls into question the conventional view that mark-ups decline during recessions as demand falls. Studying mark-up dynamics across 56 manufacturing industries in the U.S. from 1972 to 1986, Chevalier finds that average mark-ups actually rose during cyclical downturns. This can be explained by ‘deep pocket’ theories, whereby large firms with greater financial slack and resources gain market power during recessions as smaller competitors struggle, enabling higher mark-ups. Overall, these findings suggest mark-up dynamics may be more complex than traditionally assumed.
