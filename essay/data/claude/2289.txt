Building a new software package comes with numerous potential risks that organizations must consider. There are substantial costs involved in software development that may not be recouped if the product fails or does not gain market traction. Organizations must invest in market research to identify customer needs and ensure demand for the software. Technical challenges in the development process can also lead to cost overruns and schedule delays. Close oversight of development teams and code review processes help minimize risks. Another key risk is security vulnerabilities that could expose customer data or enable system breaches. Rigorous testing and auditing of software before release is critical. 

To succeed, organizations must have a clear product vision and roadmap. They need to assemble teams with the necessary technical and domain expertise. Agile development methodologies with iterative releases can reduce waste and adapt to changes. Building in metrics to measure software adoption and customer usage helps guide improvements. Integration with existing organizational systems and data is also important for productivity and business insights.

Unethical consultancies should be avoided to prevent reputational harm and legal issues. However, if already engaged, organizations must closely monitor their work and have strict oversight procedures in place. All external party work should be reviewed internally before being used or implemented. It may also be necessary to re-do or re-check aspects of their work to validate it. In some cases, it may be best to end the relationship if unethical practices are uncovered and cannot be remedied.

The emergence of e-commerce has reduced the importance of the postal rule in contracts as electronic communications have become dominant. The postal rule stated that acceptance of an offer takes effect when a letter is posted, not received. For e-commerce, acceptance takes effect when the electronic message is received by the offeror according to an electronic equivalent of the postal rule. The time of acceptance, and completion of the contract, is when the acceptance is available to access or read by the offeror.

To identify disruptive technologies, organizations can monitor research and innovation in their industry and adjacent fields. Regular technology scans, attending industry conferences, and setting up meetings with researchers and startups help with environmental scanning. Internal ideation workshops, hackathons, and innovation contests also spur new ideas. Once potential disruptions are spotted, organizations analyze them to determine the likelihood of impact and how long they may take to materialize. This influences how resources are allocated to developing new innovations vs preparing for the disruption.
