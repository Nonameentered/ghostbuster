The professionalization of medicine in the 19th century, with the rise of scientific biomedicine, led to the exclusion of women as medical practitioners, especially in the field of midwifery. As medicine established itself as a legitimate, scientific profession dominated by male physicians, traditional female healers such as midwives were marginalized and pushed out. This exclusion of women was justified and reinforced by the dominant ideology of the time, which held that women were intellectually and physically inferior to men. 

 With the rise of scientific medicine and the establishment of regulatory bodies such as the American Medical Association, the medical field transformed into an elite profession.  The new medical profession aimed to apply scientific methods to heal the human body and cure disease. Medical schools opened and male physicians secured their status through education, apprenticeship, and licensing or certification. As medicine became increasingly prestigious and lucrative, male physicians sought to differentiate themselves from female healers and close ranks against competition.       

Midwifery in particular provided an opportunity for male physicians to take over an area of health care traditionally dominated by women. Midwives were portrayed as ignorant and unclean, and blamed for high maternal mortality rates, despite their long history of successfully attending births. Male obstetricians claimed that new science and technology, such as forceps, made them better suited to manage childbirth. They lobbied for laws to restrict or ban midwifery. The campaign against midwives in the U.S. succeeded, as midwives were pushed to the margins of medicine and made subservient to physicians.  

The dominant ideology of the time, which espoused the inferiority of women compared to men, especially in intellectual and leadership roles, aided the exclusion of women from medicine. In the Victorian era, a woman's proper sphere was thought to be the private domestic space of home and family. Women were believed to be physically and mentally weaker, yet morally purer, than men. These beliefs made the public sphere of medicine an unsuitable and even unseemly place for women. Legally and politically, women lacked rights and autonomyâ€”they could not vote or own property. This subordinate status supported the claim that women should not be physicians or participate equally in medicine.

In conclusion, the rise of a professional, scientific medicine in the 19th century, coupled with the prevailing ideology of female inferiority, led to the systematic exclusion of women as healers and the demotion of midwifery. As medicine became a prestigious, male-dominated profession, women were barred from gaining the education, experience, and authority men obtained as physicians.  Midwifery in particular suffered from an organized campaign against it, as male obstetricians took control over childbirth. Though injustice and bias were at the root of women's exclusion, the medical establishment justified it through arguments about science, progress, and notions of proper gender roles. The marginalization of women in medicine would last for over a century before advancements in science and society enabled their return as physicians.
