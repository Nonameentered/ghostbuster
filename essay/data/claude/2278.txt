Matlab and Simulink provide a powerful platform for developing and testing digital communication systems. They enable modeling and simulation of various digital modulation schemes to compare their relative performance in a controlled experimental setup. The choice of modulation method significantly impacts both the ease of implementation as well as the noise tolerance of the communication system.

Some of the key digital modulation schemes that can be modeled and tested in Matlab and Simulink include:

1. Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK): It is the simplest digital modulation technique where the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied according to the digital data. It is easy to implement but has poor noise immunity as any noise or interference can alter the amplitude and corrupt the data. 

2. Frequency Shift Keying (FSK): Here, the frequency of the carrier signal is varied according to the digital data. It has better noise immunity than ASK but requires more bandwidth and is more complex to implement.

3. Phase Shift Keying (PSK): In this method, the phase of the carrier signal is varied according to the digital data. Binary PSK (BPSK) and Quadrature PSK (QPSK) are common PSK schemes. PSK has good noise immunity and bandwidth efficiency but requires complex hardware for implementation.

4. Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM): It combines ASK and PSK by varying both the amplitude and phase of the carrier signal. QAM schemes like 16-QAM and 64-QAM are commonly used. They provide high data rate but are the most complex to implement and have moderate noise immunity.

5. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM): It is a multi-carrier modulation scheme where the available bandwidth is split into many narrow-band sub-channels that are transmitted in parallel. OFDM has high spectral efficiency, immunity to selective fading, and low implementation complexity but requires tight control of frequency and timing to maintain orthogonality between sub-carriers.

The various modeling schemes and modulation techniques can be implemented and their bit error rate (BER) performance compared in Matlab and Simulink. The results can be analyzed to evaluate the trade-offs between data rate, complexity, power, bandwidth, and noise tolerance for different practical applications. OFDM in particular provides an interesting case study for further investigation into the issues around maintaining orthogonality and peak-to-average power ratio in its implementation.

In summary, Matlab and Simulink provide a powerful platform to model, simulate, and compare different digital communication systems based on the modulation schemes, channel models, and system parameters, helping analyze their relative merits and practical applications. The choice of an appropriate modulation method depends on finding the right balance between speed, reliability, power, complexity, and other requirements of the communication system.
