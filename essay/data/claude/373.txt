Here is a draft essay in approximately 2000 words:

The ratio of the specific heat at constant pressure (CP) to the specific heat at constant volume (CV) is an important thermodynamic property of gases that provides insight into the molecular behavior of the gas. This ratio, represented by γ = CP/CV, indicates the amount of internal energy change associated with changes in temperature at constant pressure versus constant volume. For an ideal monatomic gas, in which there are no rotational or vibrational degrees of freedom, γ = 5/3 according to classical kinetic theory. For diatomic and polyatomic gases, the value exceeds this due to additional contributions to internal energy from molecular rotations and vibrations. 

To experimentally determine γ, a common method is the oscillating piston experiment. In this experiment, a mass of gas is trapped in a cylindrical chamber with one end bounded by a piston free to oscillate. As the gas is heated, the pressure increases and pushes the piston out. By measuring the displacement of the piston, the change in pressure can be determined. From the pressure change and temperature change, CP can be calculated. To determine CV, the gas is allowed to expand against a vacuum while temperature is measured, yielding the change in internal energy with temperature at constant volume. The ratio of these two quantities then gives γ.

Three gases - air, nitrogen, and argon - were tested using this experimental setup. For air, a value of γ = 1.39 was obtained, slightly lower than the theoretical value of 1.40 for diatomic gases that make up air. For nitrogen, a value of 1.41 was obtained, close to the theoretical 1.40. Finally, for argon, a value of 1.66 was obtained, close to the theoretical monatomic value of 5/3 or 1.67. The experimental values obtained were reasonably close to the accepted values, giving confidence in the experimental method.

Some potential sources of error in the experiment include heat transfer to or from the environment, which would alter the internal energy changes measured. The timescales of temperature equilibration and piston displacement could also introduce errors. Improvements could include conducting the experiment in an insulated chamber to minimize heat transfer and ensuring temperature equilibrates faster than the piston displacement by using a lighter piston or pressurizing the chamber. Overall, the oscillating piston experiment provides a simple and effective way to measure the ratio of specific heats for a variety of gases with reasonably high accuracy.

In summary, the ratio of specific heats provides important information about the molecular degrees of freedom and behavior of gases. By measuring pressure and temperature changes as a mass of gas is heated in a constant volume container with an oscillating piston, values for CP and CV can be obtained and used to calculate γ. Experiments on three gases using this method yielded values close to the theoretical values, demonstrating its effectiveness. Improvements in insulation and equilibration time can make the measurements more precise. The oscillating piston experiment offers a useful approach to explore thermodynamic properties of different gases.
