The Egyptian goddess Isis underwent a remarkable transformation over time, evolving from an important deity in the Egyptian pantheon to a pan-Mediterranean goddess worshipped across the Greek and Roman worlds. However, despite her widespread worship, Isis retained core aspects of her identity that were fundamentally Egyptian. She cannot be categorized strictly as an Egyptian, Greek, or Roman goddess. Rather, she represents a fusion of religious beliefs across Mediterranean cultures.

In Egypt, Isis first appeared during the Old Kingdom period (c. 2613-2181 BCE) as an important goddess, though not among the most prominent deities. She was the wife of Osiris and the mother of Horus. As a female deity, she represented ideas of queenship, motherhood, and marital devotion. Her most recognizable attributes were her throne and crown as symbols of her royal status. During the New Kingdom (c. 1550-1077 BCE), the Osiris myth became widely popular, and Isisâ€™s role grew more significant. She resurrected Osiris after his murder by Set and protected her son Horus. This era saw her gain prominence throughout Egypt. 

The spread of Egyptian religion during the Late Period (c. 664-332 BCE) led to Isis gaining fame across the Mediterranean. In Greece, she was first mentioned around 575 BCE and a temple to Isis and Sarapis opened in Athens in 333 BCE. The Greeks identified Isis with agricultural goddesses like Demeter, using her to represent similar ideas of fertility and motherhood. However, the Greeks also adopted the entire Osiris myth and viewed Isis as a devoted wife and mother. Her worship spread widely, especially to port cities.

The Hellenistic period (323-30 BCE) marked the apex of her fame. The Ptolemaic Kings promoted her cult and built temples to Isis throughout Egypt and the Aegean. In this era, her iconography incorporated more Hellenistic details, like her depiction as a woman in a Greek chiton. However, her core attributes and mythology remained Egyptian. The spread of her cult coincided with a desire for a universal deity that could unify Egyptians and Greeks.

In conclusion, while Isis was Egyptian in origin, her cult was exported widely across the Mediterranean. Her mythology and attributes retained fundamental Egyptian elements, even as her image incorporated Greek and Roman details. She cannot be categorized as strictly Egyptian, Greek or Roman, but rather a fusion figure indicating the cultural exchanges across the ancient world. Her widespread appeal and endurance as a deity suggests her cult addressed fundamental human needs that transcended any single culture.
