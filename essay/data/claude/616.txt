The goals of investigating the rate of a chemical reaction are to determine how fast the reaction proceeds and what factors affect the speed of the reaction. The main methods for measuring the rate of a reaction are: 1) observing the disappearance of a reactant or the appearance of a product over time; 2) monitoring the change in concentration of a reactant or product over time; or 3) measuring the rate of formation or consumption of a product using an analytical technique. 

For the oxidation of benzyl alcohol in acid permanganate, the rate can be measured by monitoring the decrease in permanganate (MnO4-) concentration over time using colorimetry. The overall rate equation shows how the rate depends on the concentrations of reactants, written as Rate = k[Benzyl alcohol]x[MnO4-]y, where k is the rate constant, and x and y are the orders of reaction with respect to the alcohol and permanganate, respectively. The mechanism for this reaction involves three steps: 1) protonation of the alcohol and loss of water; 2) Reduction of MnO4- to MnO42-; 3) Oxidation of the carbocation intermediate. Based on the stoichiometry, the rate equation is expected to be Rate = k[Benzyl alcohol][MnO4-].

The activation energy (Ea) is the minimum amount of energy required for the reaction to proceed, and it determines the sensitivity of the reaction rate to temperature. The Arrhenius equation shows the relationship: Rate = A e^(-Ea/RT), where A is the pre-exponential factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature. By measuring the rate at different temperatures and plotting ln(Rate) vs. 1/T, Ea can be calculated from the slope, and A from the intercept. 

There are some limitations to this method. The Arrhenius equation assumes that the mechanism and rate-determining step remain the same over the temperature range, which may not always be the case. It also does not account for any changes in heat capacity or entropy during activation. In addition, the activation energy calculated only relates to the transition state of the rate-determining step, so it does not necessarily represent the overall reaction. However, the Arrhenius method is very useful for gaining a basic understanding of how temperature affects reaction rates and the relative influence of activation energy.

In summary, the rate equation and Arrhenius equation provide crucial insights into the kinetics and mechanism of a chemical reaction. For the oxidation of benzyl alcohol, we can determine the orders of reaction, rate constant, activation energy and pre-exponential factor, which indicate the number of steps, speed of the reaction and temperature dependence. By understanding these kinetic parameters, chemists can optimize the conditions to improve reaction efficiency and control.
