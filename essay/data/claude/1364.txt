Amnesty International’s Stop Violence Against Women campaign aims to bring awareness to and prevent many forms of violence that disproportionately impact women. From a feminist perspective, the campaign makes important contributions to addressing violence against women, but it also has some shortcomings and room for improvement in fully engaging with feminist debates on this issue. 

Amnesty International defines violence against women as “any harmful act directed at a woman because of her gender,” including physical, sexual, psychological, economic, and institutional violence and abuse. This broad definition aligns with a feminist understanding that recognizes violence against women as a systemic issue, not just isolated physical or sexual acts of harm. However, Amnesty’s writings tend to focus more on individual acts of violence rather than addressing violence against women as an instrument of patriarchal power and control. The campaign acknowledges that violence against women is a “human rights abuse” and a “consequence of discrimination and inequality,” but more robustly taking on patriarchal social structures as the root cause of violence against women would strengthen the campaign’s engagement with feminist theory.

The campaign also addresses the widespread acceptance and normalization of violence against women in society through its focus on blame culture, the invisibility of violence, and the public/private divide—all issues that feminist literature also highlights. However, the campaign faces criticism for implying that violence against women is an issue primarily for “developing” nations and certain cultures, rather than acknowledging it as a universal problem, including in Western societies. Amnesty’s campaign would benefit from more consistently framing violence against women as a product of global patriarchal values and power imbalances, not limited to certain groups.

Amnesty’s writings provide comprehensive statistics on the prevalence of violence against women and call for legal and policy changes to prevent and address abuse, but the organization historically has not approached the issue through an intersectional feminist lens. Campaign materials mention how certain groups of women may face compounded barriers, but intersectional feminism demands more than an “add and stir” approach. Truly understanding how interlocking systems of oppression create the conditions for heightened violence against women requires addressing how violence impacts women differently based on their social locations and lived experiences—including ethnicity, indigeneity, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, migration status, and economic class. The campaign’s analysis would benefit from centering the experiences of minority women and addressing how the violence they face relates to larger structures of oppression.  

In conclusion, Amnesty International’s Stop Violence Against Women campaign brings valuable awareness and advocacy to an important human rights issue. However, adopting a more thoroughly intersectional feminist approach—including addressing patriarchy and structural inequality as root causes, highlighting how violence against women is normalized and accepted in all societies, and centering the experiences of minority women—would strengthen the campaign. Overall though, Amnesty plays an important role in tackling injustice, and this campaign contributes to the global movement against gender-based violence. With its enormous platform and influence, Amnesty has the opportunity to be a leader on this issue if it further engages with feminist debates and adopts an intersectional, decolonial feminist approach.
