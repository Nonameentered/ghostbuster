How Consumer Behaviour Models Can Be Applied to Tourism Marketing 

Consumer behaviour models, which aim to understand how individuals make choices about purchasing goods or services, have important applications for tourism marketing. Specifically, consumer behaviour models can be used by marketing managers within destination organizations to better understand the needs and preferences of potential tourists in order to effectively attract them to a destination. This essay will explore how tourism consumer behaviour models can specifically benefit the destination marketing of Oxford, United Kingdom, for two important tourist segments: senior citizens and young couples. Several suggestions will also be provided for how Oxford's marketing managers could leverage these models to improve their understanding of these segments' behaviours.

Seniors represent an important and growing market for the tourism industry overall, including for the city of Oxford. As humans continue to live longer and healthier lives, many older individuals seek leisure and recreational travel opportunities for their free time after retirement. However, this group has unique needs and motivations that differentiate them as tourists. According to theories like the travel career ladder, where tourists "progress" to more complex types of holidays as they age, mature individuals typically look for more enriching and educational tours that allow them to learn, experience culture, and pursue long-developed interests (Pearce and Lee 2005). Oxford, with its abundance of historic attractions, museums, educational opportunities and cultural experiences along with strong tourism infrastructure, appeals directly to these motivations and interests, especially for North American and European seniors with connections to British heritage.

Young couples also present an important segment for Oxford's tourism market. For this demographic, especially those without children, theory around novelty seeking and thrill seeking is relevant. Younger tourists are more inclined to seek unique destinations and activities that provide excitement and adventure (Pizam et al. 2004). While Oxford may not immediately stand out as an adventurous thrill destination, its romantic appeal, picturesque scenery, dining options and opportunities for short excursions to surrounding areas of natural beauty and outdoor activities attract young couples looking for a novel getaway. The youthful energy and novelty also appeal to younger tourists' social motivations, such as posting holiday photos on social media to generate likes and shares from peers.

Understanding these distinct consumer behaviours and motivations can greatly benefit Oxford's tourism marketing aimed at seniors and young couples. For seniors, marketing content should emphasize the educational and cultural attractions, highlight links to British history and heritage, and convey Oxford as an epistemic destination, catering to curiosity and learning. Package tours, events and itineraries that facilitate deeper understanding of attractions will also appeal. For young couples, marketing should focus on the destination's romantic atmosphere, charming scenery and culinary experiences with an element of adventure. Social media campaigns and hashtag challenges prompting photo sharing and peer engagement will tap into key motivations.  Overall, appealing to the unique factors that motivate these segments to travel by translating them into marketing messages and tourism products will help managers boost the effectiveness of their efforts. 

In conclusion, understanding and translating theories of tourist behaviour and motivation into destination marketing strategies is key for tourism managers seeking to attract certain segments. For the city of Oxford, recognizing the distinct characteristics, needs and interests of senior citizens and young couples will allow marketing managers to tailor promotions, products and messaging to more effectively tap into these groups. By closely aligning marketing with what motivates these tourists to travel, visit and explore Oxford, tourism managers can gain a competitive advantage in an increasingly crowded tourism marketplace.
