Social research aims to generate knowledge about human society and social life. However, researchers face many ethical dilemmas in conducting research given that it often involves studying human subjects. There are no easy answers or solutions to these dilemmas as they involve balancing the interests of the researchers, research participants and the wider society. 

One key dilemma is around informed consent and voluntary participation. Researchers need to ensure that participants provide their informed consent to participate in the research after understanding the purpose and nature of the study. This is challenging as participants may not fully grasp the implications of their participation, especially for longitudinal studies. They may feel coerced to participate due to the power dynamics with the researcher. Researchers have to be extremely sensitive to these issues and avoid being overly persuasive in recruiting participants.

Another dilemma centers around privacy and confidentiality. Researchers collect personal information from participants, who share details about their lives in interviews, surveys, observations, etc. Researchers must keep these details private and confidential, only using the data for the stated research purposes. However, in practice, it can be difficult to ensure confidentiality and anonymity, especially in studies with vulnerable groups or on sensitive topics. Researchers may face pressures to disclose information to authorities or may not be able to sufficiently hide the identities of participants in published reports.

There are also dilemmas around deception and covert research methods. Some research questions can only be answered by concealing the true purpose of the study from participants or through covert observation. However, deceiving participants or studying them without consent violates their trust and autonomy. Researchers have to weigh the potential knowledge gains of such studies versus the ethical costs, and look for alternative methodologies whenever possible.

To illustrate these dilemmas, we can consider the famous Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE) conducted by Philip Zimbardo. The SPE studied the psychological effects of perceived power by assigning male students to the role of either prisoner or guard in a mock prison scenario. However, Zimbardo failed to consider the psychological harm and coercion involved, and the experiment spiraled out of control. The guards became abusive towards prisoners, and prisoners experienced distress. The study had to be ended early, highlighting the difficulty of gaining true voluntary informed consent and the researcher's conflict of interest.

In conclusion, there are no easy answers to the ethical dilemmas in social research. Researchers must carefully consider the ethics of their methodologies and work to minimize potential harm to participants. They need to be fully transparent in gaining informed consent, protecting privacy and avoiding coercion. At the same time, they have to balance these interests against the value that can be gained from the research. Tough judgment calls have to be made, but ethical considerations should be prioritized in all decisions. Overall, integrity, empathy and responsibility are key ethical values that researchers must uphold to conduct morally sound social research.
