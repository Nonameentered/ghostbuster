Here is a 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

The coarse graining technique reduces the level of detail in a molecular model by grouping together atoms into single interaction sites to enable simulations of larger length and time scales. In lipid bilayer modelling, coarse graining allows simulations of vesicles and their dynamics by reducing the number of degrees of freedom. A popular coarse grained model for lipids is the MARTINI model, where on average 4 heavy atoms are represented by a single interaction site. 

This reduction in detail improves the accuracy and fidelity of results compared to previous all-atom simulations in several ways. Firstly, much larger system sizes can bemodelled, up to the scale of vesicles, enabling the observation of emergent phenomena arising from interactions between many lipids that would be impossible in smaller all-atom systems. Secondly, much longer timescales can be accessed, up to milliseconds, allowing the observation of slow dynamics such as vesicle formation, fusion and fission. Finally, by averaging out high frequency atomic fluctuations, the coarse grained model can reproduce structural and thermodynamic properties that agree well with experimental results.

Several stages of vesicle formation from initially random lipids have been observed in coarse grained simulations. First, small lipid aggregates form through self-assembly. These then coalesce and fuse into larger aggregates and then vesicular structures. During this process, the lipids reorganize to form single and double lipid bilayers. The simulations show that vesicle formation is nucleated around a few larger lipid aggregates that then grow by incorporating smaller aggregates and excess lipids from solution. This growth process agrees well with experimental observations. 

The coarse grained MARTINI model has been shown to reproduce the area per lipid, bilayer thickness, lateral diffusion constant and other properties of lipid bilayers that match experiments. The model also agrees with the critical vesicle concentration and size distribution of vesicles formed from self-assembly simulations. Despite its simplicity, the MARTINI coarse grained lipid model is able to capture the essential physical properties of lipids and their assemblies.

In summary, the coarse graining technique applied to lipid bilayer modelling with the MARTINI forcefield allows access to length and timescales required to model complex phenomena such as vesicle formation and dynamics. By reducing high frequency atomic fluctuations, the model produces results that agree closely with a range of experimental properties of lipid bilayers and vesicles. The MARTINI coarse grained model provides a useful computational tool for studying biomembrane processes that would otherwise be very challenging using all-atom simulations.
