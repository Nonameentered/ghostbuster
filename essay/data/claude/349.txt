Here is a draft essay in 1500 words:

The European Council formally plays a significant role in European Union decision making through its leadership of the Council and contributes to the direction and priorities of the EU. However, it is not hierarchically superior to the EU institutions established by the Treaties. The statement that “The European Council does not play a formal role in the Community decision-making and does not constitute an institution hierarchically superior to the Community Institutions” is an oversimplification that ignores the European Council’s de facto influence and leadership in the EU.  

According to Article 15(1) TEU, the European Council “shall provide the Union with the necessary impetus for its development” and “shall define the general political directions and priorities thereof.” This indicates that the European Council has a leadership role in determining the strategic direction and priorities of the EU. The European Council also has the power to adopt conclusions that guide the work of the Council and Commission. For example, in March 2018, the European Council adopted conclusions on “Developing the African Peace and Security Architecture” that set out priorities to strengthen cooperation on peace and security with the African Union. These conclusions then guide the Council and Commission’s actions and policies in this area.

However, while the European Council contributes to political leadership, it does not have a hierarchical superiority over the Council, Commission and Parliament which are the central law-making institutions of the EU. Legally binding EU rules can only be adopted through the ‘community method’ involving the Council, Commission, and Parliament. The European Council’s role is to provide political direction to these institutions but it does not have the power to impose laws. For example, in policy areas subject to the ‘community method’ such as the environment, the Council can only adopt legislation with the proposal of the Commission and consent of the Parliament. The European Council cannot compel the other institutions to propose, adopt or approve certain legislation.  

In practice, the European Council exerts considerable influence over decision making due to its political leadership. It comprises the heads of state or government of the member states, has responsibility for defining the EU’s overall political direction and priorities, and meets frequently to address key issues. However, its role remains advisory and it depends on the other institutions to implement decisions. There have been calls to formally recognize the European Council’s de facto role, for example by giving it power to set strategic agendas for the EU or appoint certain high-level EU officials. However, reform also risks upsetting the institutional balance of powers established by the Treaties.

In conclusion, while the statement that the “European Council does not play a formal role in Community decision-making and does not constitute an institution hierarchically superior to the Community Institutions” is legally correct, it fails to capture the European Council’s far-reaching influence and leadership in EU decision making. The European Council formally guides the direction and priorities of the EU within the limits of the Treaties. Whether its role should be reformed to match political realities while maintaining institutional balance of power remains an open debate. Overall, the European Council is a crucial yet complex component of the EU institutional framework.
