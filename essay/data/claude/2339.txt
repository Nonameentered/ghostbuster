Is Tense a Matter of Syntax in the English Language System?

Tense refers to the grammatical expression of time in language. In the English language system, tense is primarily conveyed through the use of inflections on verbs, indicating location in past, present or future time. At its core, tense seems to be a matter of morphology and syntax in English. 

However, the relationship between tense and syntax is complex. Although tense is structurally expressed through verbal inflections, it also interacts with other syntactic elements like temporal adverbs and clauses. Tense also has a semantic dimension, being used to locate situations in time and sequence events. While tense appears on the surface to be a simple matter of subject-verb agreement and inflection, a deeper analysis shows it is linked to broader structures and meanings in language.

Verbs in English are marked for tense through the addition of inflections like ‘-ed’ for the past and ‘-s’ for the present. For example, ‘walk’ becomes ‘walked’ in the past tense and ‘walks’ in the present. The bare verb form ‘walk’ is used for the infinitive and future. These inflections are matters of verb morphology, the study of word structure and form. At a syntactic level, tense is also signaled through the combination of the verb inflection with the subject, as in ‘he walks’ versus ‘he walked’. In this sense, tense is a function of sentence structure and grammar.

However, tense interacts with other elements of syntax. Temporal adverbs like ‘yesterday’ or ‘now’ work with verb tense to give a more precise time indicator, as in ‘he walked yesterday’ versus ‘he walks now’. Tense also co-occurs with temporal clauses, like ‘when I arrived, he left’ which uses the past tense ‘arrived’ and ‘left’ to connect two events in a sequence. In these examples, tense is not simply a property of the verb but depends on its syntax in the sentence and utterance.

Semantically, tense conveys meaning related to locating situations in time and sequencing events. The choice of tense in an utterance represents the speaker’s view of the time when an event took place, whether in the past, present or future. The sequence of tenses can also represent the order in which events occurred, as with ‘he walked’ followed by ‘he has left’, showing one past event preceding another. Temporal adverbs and clauses provide additional cues to help the listener understand the timing and relationships between events.

In conclusion, while tense appears on the surface to be primarily a matter of morphology and syntax in English, as evidenced in basic subject-verb agreement and verb inflections, it has deeper connections to semantics and utterance meaning. Tense interacts with other elements like adverbs and clauses that together situate events in time and provide temporal context. So tense could be considered more broadly as a matter of temporal meaning expressed through the morphology, syntax and semantics of the English language system. Its role is both structural and meaningful. Tense is indeed more than just a simple matter of syntax.
