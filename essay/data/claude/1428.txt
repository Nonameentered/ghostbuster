There is a well-established bidirectional relationship between health and economic development. On the one hand, improved health outcomes, such as lower mortality and morbidity rates, increase life expectancy, and enhance human capabilities, which drive long-term economic growth by making the workforce more productive and expanding the tax base. On the other hand, increased income and economic development lead to improved access to healthcare, nutrition, education, and technological innovation, all of which enhance health outcomes. 

The determinants of health are complex and multifactorial but can be broadly categorized into social, environmental, and economic drivers. Income and education are two of the most significant economic determinants of health. Higher income allows for greater spending on essential health inputs such as food, shelter, healthcare, and a clean environment. Education also has a strong positive impact on health for several reasons. First, educated individuals tend to have higher health literacy and awareness, allowing them to make better nutrition, hygiene, and healthcare consumption choices. Second, education improves access to health-related resources and the ability to navigate healthcare systems. Finally, education leads to higher-paying job opportunities that provide essential benefits like healthcare access and insurance.

Cross-national data analysis provides compelling evidence for the relationship between income, education, and health. Life expectancy is strongly correlated with GDP per capita, indicating that those living in higher-income countries, on average, live longer and healthier lives. Infant and maternal mortality rates as well as the incidence of communicable diseases are significantly lower in higher-income countries. Within countries, those with higher levels of education and income also exhibit better health outcomes on average. For example, in the U.S., college-educated individuals have lower obesity and smoking rates and live, on average, five years longer than those without a high school degree.

To maximize health and economic development, governments can implement policies that invest in human capabilities and provide equal opportunities across current and future generations. Access to high-quality healthcare, nutrition, and education should be guaranteed to all citizens regardless of their ability to pay. Healthcare policy should emphasize preventative care and management of chronic diseases, which pose a substantial health and economic burden. Public health initiatives, especially those targeting maternal and child health, vaccination, and health promotion, have very high returns on investment. Governments also need to foster economic policies that promote growth and shared prosperity, reducing poverty and income inequality.

In conclusion, health and economic development have a cyclical and mutually reinforcing relationship. By investing in human capabilities through healthcare, education, and economic opportunity, governments can improve population health, increase life expectancy, and accelerate economic growth over generations. With targeted policy interventions that provide access to essential health and social services for all citizens regardless of their socioeconomic status, governments can cultivate sustainable progress in health, education, and income. Overall, a nation's health and wealth go hand in hand; one cannot thrive without the other.
