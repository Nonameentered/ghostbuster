There are several factors contributing to the rising obesity epidemic. First, an imbalance in energy balance, with more calories consumed than expended, causes weight gain and obesity. The energy balance is the difference between the energy (measured in calories) a person takes in through eating and drinking, and the energy expended through physical activity and metabolic processes. When an individual consistently consumes more calories than they burn, the excess energy is stored in the body as fat, resulting in weight gain and eventually obesity.

Second, obesity rates have risen in part due to an 'obesogenic environment' - surroundings that promote obesity. Today, people are surrounded by cheap, readily available high-calorie, low-nutrient foods and beverages. Fast food is ubiquitous, and huge portion sizes have become the norm. At the same time, physical activity has been "engineered out" of people's daily lives with the rise of labour-saving devices and sedentary activities like watching TV, using computers and playing video games. These environmental factors make it very easy to overeat and gain weight.

People's diets have also changed significantly over the past 25 years. There has been a substantial increase in the consumption of high-calorie and low-nutrient foods and drinks, especially fast food, processed snacks, and sugary beverages. These calorie-dense foods are often high in saturated fat, sugar and salt but low in nutrients, and their increased consumption has contributed to obesity rates. In contrast, consumption of more nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins has declined. 

Physical activity plays an important role in weight maintenance and loss. The recommended levels are at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week for adults, and 60 minutes per day for children. Unfortunately, most adults and youth do not meet these recommendations. Engaging in regular physical activity helps build muscle, speed up metabolism, and burn calories, all of which aid weight loss and maintenance. It also provides numerous other health benefits like improving stamina, endurance, bone health, and mood.

In England, about 63% of adults and 30% of children are overweight or obese. Obesity increases the risk of developing health conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer and osteoarthritis. However, individuals can take steps to improve their health and reduce disease risks. Following a balanced nutritious diet, reducing calorie intake, increasing physical activity, limiting sedentary activities and getting enough sleep are some of the key things people can do to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.
