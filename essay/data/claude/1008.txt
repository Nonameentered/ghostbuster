Quine's paradox and the Liar paradox are two well-known semantic paradoxes that have intrigued philosophers for centuries. Both paradoxes relate to problems that arise from self-reference and circular reasoning. However, the paradoxes differ in their exact construction and have evolved differently in terms of proposed solutions over time.  

Quine's paradox, developed by philosopher W.V.Quine, considers the scenario of a native tribe whose language contains a truth predicate, a logical device to attribute truth. The tribe has a sentence that says "yields a true sentence when concatenated onto its own quotation" when concatenated onto its own quotation. This leads to a contradiction because if the sentence is true, then it must be false, and vice versa. The paradox arises from the self-reference of a sentence that talks about its own truth value.

The Liar paradox is older and considers the sentence "This sentence is false." If the sentence is true, then it is false, and if it is false, then it is true, leading to a contradiction. Like Quine's paradox, the Liar paradox arises from a sentence that refers to its own truth value in a circular way. However, the Liar paradox does this more explicitly by directly claiming its own falsehood.

Proposed solutions to the paradoxes have evolved over time. Early solutions to the Liar paradox tried to avoid self-reference by declaring such sentences as meaningless or illogical. However, this was unsatisfactory as the paradox still arises even when self-reference is subtly embedded. Other proposals suggested that such sentences lack a truth value altogether, an approach known as "dialetheism." However, this solution is objectionable to some as it allows for true contradictions.

A popular modern solution to both paradoxes is the hierarchical approach, where sentences are assessed relative to a hierarchy of "languages." A sentence in a lower "language" may be meaningful but lack a truth value from the perspective of a higher "language." For example, in the Liar paradox, "This sentence is false" is meaningful in the object language but lacks a truth value in the meta-language. This approach resolves the paradoxes while keeping the sentences meaningful.

In summary, while Quine's paradox and the Liar paradox are both semantic paradoxes relating to self-reference, they differ in their construction and specifics. The Liar paradox is simpler in its formulation but has been discussed for much longer. Proposed solutions have evolved from declaring the sentences meaningless to more sophisticated approaches that keep the sentences meaningful while resolving the contradictions through a hierarchical, multi-linguistic framework. These solutions apply similarly to both Quine's paradox and the Liar paradox, though open questions remain.
