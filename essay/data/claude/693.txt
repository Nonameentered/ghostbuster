My initial understanding of strategy was rather superficial and limited. I saw strategy primarily as a matter of pursuing some clearly defined goals and objectives. Successful strategies involved identifying obstacles and challenges, offering solutions to overcome them, and organizing resources and efforts to achieve a set of goals. At the core, strategy seemed to be mostly about thinking ahead, planning, and preparation.  

As I studied strategy in more depth, my perspective evolved and expanded significantly. I came to appreciate strategy as an emerging and adaptive process, not just a fixed plan. Successful strategies evolve based on continuous learning and adaptation. As the strategy unfolds, new challenges arise, the environment changes, and key assumptions prove wrong. The ability to sense changes, learn quickly, and adapt the strategy accordingly is what allows some strategies to succeed where others fail. 

Strategy is also intensely human, not just a rational or analytical exercise. Strategies depend on the people formulating and implementing them. The key strategists mold the strategy based on their own judgments, intuitions, experiences, and biases. Strategies reflect the complex mix of psychological factors that shape human decision making. Understanding these human elements—cognitive biases, risk preferences, interpersonal dynamics—is key to crafting and executing effective strategies.

Further, I gained an appreciation for strategy as an interactive and competitive process. Strategies do not unfold in a vacuum; they involve a dynamic interplay between multiple actors. As one organization crafts and deploys a strategy, competitors respond with counterstrategies, and the cycle repeats. Success is relative, not absolute, determined by how well a strategy enables an organization to outmaneuver and outlearn its rivals. The competitive back-and-forth continually reshapes the strategic landscape in which organizations operate.

In sum, my studies have given me a much richer perspective on strategy. I now see strategy as a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. It involves adaptive processes, not just fixed plans. It depends profoundly on human factors like judgment, intuition, and organizational dynamics. And it unfolds through a constant interactive process in a competitive environment with multiple strategic actors. This multidimensional view provides a deeper understanding of what really constitutes strategic thinking and success. My journey to understand strategy has only begun, but I feel I now have a more sophisticated aperture through which to view this fascinating topic.
