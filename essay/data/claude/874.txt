The global food system has been transformed dramatically in recent decades by the forces of globalization, including increased trade, the liberalization of agricultural markets, and the rise of transnational food corporations and supply chains. There are undoubtedly many benefits that have come from a more globally connected food system, including a greater diversity of foods, lower food prices for consumers in developed nations, and economic opportunity for food exporters. However, globalization has also exacerbated inequalities in the global food system and intensified the vulnerability of marginalized groups to lack of access to affordable and nutritious food.   

The key mechanisms by which the food system has globalized - trade liberalization, the growth of food aid, and corporate control of the food supply - have created clear winners and losers. The push to liberalize global agricultural trade beginning in the 1990s with the WTO and trade deals like NAFTA opened up new export opportunities for large food-producing nations and their agribusinesses. However, by pitting small subsistence farmers in developing countries against highly subsidized producers from the US and Europe, liberalization often undercut domestic food production in poor countries. Liberalization benefited transnational corporations by allowing them to source agricultural goods cheaply around the world, but hurt small farmers who could not compete on price.  

The growth of food aid, while beneficial for addressing acute hunger, has also seriously undermined local food producers and distorted agricultural markets in recipient countries. When free or subsidized food aid from the US and other nations floods into markets during times outside of emergency situations, it depresses food prices and makes it difficult for local farmers to earn a living. While food aid is undoubtedly humanitarian, it is often tied to agricultural interests in donor countries and does little to build long-term food security. The interests of donors and their domestic agricultural lobbies take priority over the needs and agricultural capacities of recipients.   

The rise of transnational agribusinesses and their global supply chains has also contributed to inequality in the food system. Giant corporations dominate global markets in grains, meat production and processing, and snacks, and prioritize large-scale industrial agriculture focused on mass distribution and maximizing shareholder profits. While they bring lower consumer prices and highly efficient production through their size and scale, large food corporations squeeze out smaller producers, overlook environmental and health externalities, and gain an unequal amount of power and control over the global food supply. They represent the interests of the affluent consumers they serve globally but ignore the poor and marginalized.  

Those who have lost out in the globalized food system are the poor subsistence farmers, agricultural laborers, and the urban poor in developing countries who cannot afford the cheap calories provided by big food corporations and instead rely on local agricultural markets. With their livelihoods undercut by food aid and trade policies that preference Western agribusinesses, many small farmers can no longer support themselves and migrate to urban slums, while others face increased poverty and malnutrition due to lack of access to affordable nutritious foods that globalization has overlooked. Women often bear the brunt of these inequalities as key agricultural workers and caregivers responsible for household food security.  

The globalization of the world's food supply has brought economic opportunity and a greater abundance of low-cost calories to affluent populations. But it has failed to address the root causes of hunger for the most vulnerable groups and instead intensified existing inequalities. Achieving a sustainable, equitable and just global food system will require policies, technologies and business models that protect and empower local small-scale farmers and make nutritious, culturally-appropriate foods accessible to all people regardless of their socioeconomic status. By supporting communities in feeding themselves through their own agricultural development and economic growth, the global food system can distribute the benefits of globalization far more evenly than at present.
