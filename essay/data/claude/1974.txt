The four-step conservation research programme involves identifying conservation priorities, determining threats, developing practical solutions, and measuring success. Genetic analysis plays a crucial role in identifying conservation priorities and determining threats  to species.

The first step is identifying species and populations that are a high priority for conservation. Genetic analysis can help determine the level of genetic diversity and uncover unique evolutionary lineages that should be prioritised for protection. For example, Table 2 shows that chimpanzees in Gabon and western gorillas in the Congo have high genetic distinctiveness, indicating they should be conservation priorities. 

The second step is investigating potential threats to these priority species and populations. Genetic analysis can detect signs of inbreeding depression or loss of genetic diversity that may threaten the health of small populations. For instance, endangered mountain gorillas in the Virunga volcanic mountains showed loss of diversity and inbreeding, highlighting threats to their long term survival. Genetic analysis can also identify populations that hybridise with other species, threatening species integrity.

The third step develops solutions for mitigating threats, including habitat protection, controlling diseases, and maintaining connectivity between populations to enable gene flow. For some species, managed breeding programmes may need to be established to maintain genetic diversity.

The final step monitors the success of conservation solutions over time using genetic analysis. Regular genetic sampling can detect if genetic diversity is stabilising or increasing, ensuring populations are sufficiently large and connected, and proper gene flow is occurring between isolated populations. For example, genetic analysis can determine if breeding programmes and reintroductions of species have been successful in maintaining genetically healthy populations.

In summary, genetic analysis is a vital tool at multiple stages of the conservation research programme. By detecting genetic threats, identifying unique lineages, and monitoring success of conservation solutions, genetic analysis helps ensure the effective preservation of endangered species.
