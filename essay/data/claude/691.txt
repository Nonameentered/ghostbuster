Apple experienced a dramatic fall from grace in the 1990s but was able to successfully bounce back in the following decade through strategic changes to its business. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Apple dominated the personal computer market with its Macintosh line of computers. However, a series of missteps caused the company to lose significant market share to IBM and Microsoft's Windows operating system by the mid-1990s. 

A key reason for Apple's initial success was its vertically integrated business model. Apple designed and manufactured both the Macintosh hardware and the Macintosh operating system, allowing for a high degree of integration and quality control. However, this model also made Apple slow to adapt to changes in the market. When graphical user interfaces and mouse input gained widespread adoption in the late 1980s, Apple failed to make the Macintosh operating system compatible with non-Apple hardware. Instead, Apple stuck to the vertically integrated model and did not license the Macintosh operating system to other computer manufacturers. This allowed Windows and Intel-based PC clones to dominate the market.

Apple's unwillingness to allow Macintosh clones was a strategic mistake that significantly hurt the company in the 1990s. Macintosh computers remained a niche product, comprising only about 5-10% of the personal computer market share during this time. Apple did not enjoy the same economies of scale as the PC market, resulting in higher prices for less powerful Macintosh computers. Many software developers focused their efforts on the much larger Windows market, limiting the availability of software for the Mac ecosystem. 

 weaknesses in product development also plagued Apple during this period. The company took too long to release the Power Macintosh line, falling behind competitors in the performance of its machines. The 1996 acquisition of NeXT brought Steve Jobs back to Apple as interim CEO and paved the way for more innovative products. However, products like the Newton personal digital assistant and PowerBook laptop computers were commercial failures, in part due to their high prices and underwhelming performance.

To revive its fortunes, Apple made dramatic changes to its strategy under Steve Jobs' leadership. It discontinued licensing of the Macintosh operating system, built innovative products like the iMac and iPod, opened its own retail stores to control the customer experience, and developed a digital hub strategy around the Mac computer. These moves allowed Apple to turn its fortunes around in the late 1990s and 2000s.

In summary, Apple's fall in the 1990s can be attributed to its failure to adapt to industry changes due to weaknesses in its vertically integrated model, unwillingness to license its operating system, lack of product innovation, and less competitive pricing. By addressing these strategic issues, revising its business model, and releasing innovative products starting in the late 1990s, Apple was able to regain its dominant position in the technology industry. Overall, Apple's experience during this time period shows how companies need to continually evaluate their key resources and capabilities to identify potential weaknesses and make necessary changes to succeed in a dynamic marketplace.
