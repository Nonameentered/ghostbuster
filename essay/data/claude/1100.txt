Here is a draft 3000-word essay response to the prompt:

There are several factors that contribute to the conductivity or, conversely, the resistivity of a material. Conductivity, which is the inverse of resistivity, refers to how well an electric current can flow through a material. Materials with high conductivity allow current to flow easily, while materials with low conductivity hinder the flow of current and are more resistive.

The first factor that determines a material's conductivity is the availability and mobility of charged carriers, such as electrons and ions. In metals, electrons are delocalized and free to move, giving metals high conductivity. In ionic compounds, ions are mobile and can carry charge, also resulting in high conductivity when molten or in solution. In insulators, there are no free charges available, so they have low conductivity. Semiconductors like silicon can have their conductivity manipulated by adding impurities, called dopants, which provide extra free charges.

The second factor is the chemical bonding in the material. Strongly bonded materials where electrons are tightly bound to atoms tend to be insulators with low conductivity. Metals with delocalized electrons that are not bound to any particular atom are highly conductive. Ionic materials with mobile ions held together by electrostatic forces are also conductive when molten or in solution. The strength and configuration of chemical bonding impacts how much charge is available for conduction and how mobile those charges can be.  

A third factor is the atomic or molecular structure of the material. Highly ordered crystalline materials have low conductivity because there are few defects in the lattice for charges to flow through. Less ordered or amorphous materials with more defects often show higher conductivity. The geometry and spacing of atoms or molecules also impacts how much empty space is available for charges to move through. Materials with open structures and large gaps or channels tend to be more conductive.

The final factor that determines a material's conductivity is its temperature. As temperature increases, the thermal energy provides charges more kinetic energy so they can move more freely. This means conductivity generally increases with increasing temperature. Measuring a material's resistivity over a range of temperatures can provide useful insights into how strongly the material's structure and bonding restrict charge mobility.

For a particular application, these factors can be considered to select the material with the most suitable conductivity. A high-temperature device may require a material with strong temperature-dependent conductivity. An optical device may need a transparent material with conductivity in a specific range. By measuring candidate materials' conductivity and how it changes with temperature, chemical composition, and microstructure, the optimal material can be identified for a given task.

In summary, the availability and mobility of charge carriers, the chemical bonding, the structural order, and the temperature all contribute to a material's conductivity and resistivity. Careful measurement of these properties can inform the selection of materials for applications where specific conductivity requirements must be met.
