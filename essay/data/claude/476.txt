Rousseau's Fundamental Problem and Proposed Solution

Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the 18th-century Genevan philosopher, identified a fundamental problem of society and politics in his works such as The Social Contract. For Rousseau, the root problem was inequality and oppression that arose from the unnatural development of civilization. As society evolved from a state of nature to a civil society organized around private property, notions of inequality and corrupt power structures emerged. Those who were able to accumulate more property were able to dominate others, and this domination was antithetical to freedom.

Rousseau's solution to this problem was the establishment of the "general will" through a social contract. By entering into a social contract, individuals within a society could join together to promote the common good and overall will of the society. The general will represented the collective well-being of citizens and the society. Leaders and laws would aim to represent and uphold the general will, rather than particular wills of individuals or factions. The general will could remedy inequality and promote freedom, creating conditions where "the individual finds his freedom in submitting to the community."

The relevance and practicality of Rousseau's general will, however, are debatable. There is an appeal to the notion that leaders and governments should aim to represent the common good of citizens and society as a whole. Protecting the overall well-being of a community seems noble and worthwhile. However, in practice, determining the "will" of an entire community and gaining consensus is extremely difficult. There will inevitably be disagreement over what constitutes the common good. Rousseau himself argued that certain criteria like freedom and equality needed to be met for the general will to be valid. But individuals and groups within a society may have very different views of what freedom, equality, and justice really mean. 

Rousseau argued for strict conditions on voting and democracy to generate the general will, but in reality, there are inescapable challenges in gaining universal consensus and totally uncorrupted representation. There is a tendency for particular interests and inequalities to emerge even within a seemingly democratic system. The general will, while appealing in theory, is difficult to apply without controversy or conflict in actual politics. At the same time, its ideals of consensus, representation, equality, and freedom should still aim to inform any democratic system and help mitigate the influence of domineering particular wills.

In conclusion, while Rousseau identified a fundamental problem of inequality and domination in society, his proposed solution of the general will faces substantial obstacles in practical application and implementation. The ideals behind the general will—especially aims of consensus, representation, and equality—remain highly relevant, but actually determining and following the "will" of an entire community is wrought with challenges. Politically, a diversity of wills and interests are unavoidable, and the general will is difficult to achieve in any absolute sense. However, as a regulative ideal in politics, the general will still highlights what any democratic system should strive for: governance in the common interest of all citizens and for the good of society as a whole. Overall, Rousseau's solution warrants critical examination, but his articulation of the ideals behind it suggest their enduring and unrealized worth.
