Linear and non-linear models are two broad approaches used to analyze data obtained from road tyre characteristics. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses that must be considered based on the type of data and analysis required. 

Linear models are simple models where the response variable, y, has a linear relationship with the input variable, x. They are easy to calculate, visualize and interpret. Common examples of linear models for tyre data analysis include linear regression and principal component analysis. Linear regression can be used to model the relationship between tyre load and deflection or tyre speed and temperature. The coefficients provide information on how y changes with x, enabling predictions and extrapolations. Principal component analysis reduces the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variation, making it easier to visualize and analyze high-dimensional data.

However, linear models have significant limitations when modeling tyre data which exhibits nonlinear behavior. They cannot capture complex relationships that commonly arise from interactions of multiple tyre variables. They also fail when the data contains distinct regimes of tyre response at high and low values of the input variables. Non-linear models do not have these restrictions and can model a wider range of tyre performance relationships.

Common non-linear models for tyre analysis include polynomial regression, exponential and logarithmic functions. MATLAB has a Curve Fitting Toolbox with an app that can be used to select an appropriate non-linear model based on the data. The selected model equation can then be used to visualize the data, make predictions and gain insights into tyre behavior. For example, an exponential model may be suitable to model the relationship between tyre speed and power. The model coefficients provide information on how tyre power changes at low and high speeds. 

In conclusion, a combination of linear and non-linear models should be used to fully analyze tyre test data. Linear models provide a simple initial analysis but non-linear models are required to capture the complex behavior of tyres. MATLAB is a useful tool for analyzing tyre data as it has functionality for selecting, fitting and visualizing both linear and non-linear models. By comparing these models, conclusions can be drawn about the mechanics of tyre behavior under different operating conditions.
