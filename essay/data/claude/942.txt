Here is a 245-word essay response to the prompt:

For a First Order Plus Dead Time (FOPDT) system, the most effective type of discrete controller to use is a PID controller with proper tuning. PID controllers are able to adjust the proportional, integral and derivative gains to optimize the response of a system. This allows for improved accuracy and efficiency over proportional-only or Dahlin controllers. 

Theoretically, a proportional-only controller could be used for a FOPDT system, however, its response may be slow or produce large overshoots. The proportional gain would have to be very low to avoid instability, but this results in a slow response. The Dahlin controller improves on the proportional-only controller by adding a derivative term to increase system stability. However, the derivative term may amplify measurement noise and the controller still cannot eliminate overshoot or shorten rise time.

A PID controller is able to overcome the limitations of the other controllers through tuning its three parameters. The proportional gain can be increased to speed up the response without instability. The integral gain helps to eliminate overshoot and achieve the desired setpoint. The derivative gain can be optimized to dampen the system without amplifying noise. Tuning the PID gains through simulated testing allows the controller to produce the fastest and most accurate response for a FOPDT system.

In summary, while proportional, Dahlin and PID controllers can all theoretically control a FOPDT system, the PID controller is able to achieve superior performance through tuning. By adjusting its gains to the unique parameters of the system, a PID controller can achieve the fastest rise time, minimize overshoot, reduce steady-state error, and optimize stability. This results in the most accurate and efficient control of a FOPDT system. Overall, a tuned PID controller would produce the simulated outputs closest to the ideal response.
