The patient, a 72-year-old female, was referred for a swallowing disorder known as dysphagia. During her initial physical exam, several observations were made that warranted further investigation into her condition. Firstly, the patient complained of difficulty swallowing solid foods over the past few months. She noted that certain foods seemed to get 'stuck' in her throat, especially bread, meats, and pills. She had lost 10 pounds unintentionally over the past 3 months due to avoiding many foods. 

Secondly, the patient exhibited signs of dehydration, including dry mouth, fatigue, and dizziness. She mentioned only being able to drink thin liquids, as anything slightly thick immediately caused choking and coughing. Her skin turgor was poor, indicating possible dehydration. She was advised to increase fluid intake and referred to a dietitian to discuss safe food options and supplements to avoid further weight loss and dehydration in the interim before her swallowing assessment.

Next, the patient's voice quality was breathy and raspy, and she had a wet-sounding cough suggestive of possible aspiration of solids/liquids into her airway. Her breathing also seemed slightly labored while talking and eating. A chest x-ray was ordered to check for signs of aspiration pneumonia before proceeding with a swallowing test. 

Finally, the patient demonstrated difficulty controlling saliva and had noticeable spillage from her mouth while talking. She frequently had to wipe her mouth and chin, indicating possible dysphagia for liquids in addition to solids. An assessment of oral motor control and a clinical swallow exam were required to determine if true dysphagia of multiple textures was present. 

In summary, unintentional weight loss, dehydration, coughing/choking during meals, voice changes, difficulty controlling saliva, and other observations evidenced during the initial physical exam supported the referral for dysphagia investigation and warranted speech language pathology assessment and possibly imaging or scopes to properly diagnose and treat the patient's swallowing difficulties. The next steps will be to determine the severity and exact nature of the patient's dysphagia in order to recommend appropriate interventions to manage symptoms and promote safe and adequate nutrition.
