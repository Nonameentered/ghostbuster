Here is a draft 1250 word essay in response to the prompt:

Plutarch uses the end of the Life of Pericles to highlight the virtues of Pericles and defend him against charges of being a demagogue by demonstrating Pericles' steady leadership, dignity, and care for the people of Athens. Throughout his biography, Plutarch makes it clear that Pericles was a cautious and principled statesman, not a rash demagogue catering to the whims of the crowd. 

In the final chapters of the Life, Athens is struck by a devastating plague. Plutarch shows how Pericles responded with calm determination, refusing to pander to fear or superstition. When law and order began to break down, Pericles issued a proclamation forbidding unlawful burials and staying indoors, demonstrating his commitment to stability. While others blamed the gods, Pericles comforted the citizens with rational words about the natural course of diseases. Plutarch says "he was commeided for the mildness and calmness of his behavior" in contrast with others who were "seized with a violent passion for insubordination and anarchy."

Even after Pericles lost friends and family to the plague, Plutarch shows his unflinching leadership. When the people turned against him in anger and grief, Pericles stood before them undaunted and persuaded them again with another speech. Plutarch says "his firmness and confidence...settled their minds once more into a state of renewed equanimity and self-possession." This steadiness and dedication to the greater good demonstrate Pericles' virtue and concern for citizens over himself.

Finally, on his deathbed, Plutarch shows how Pericles proved himself no demagogue by refusing to flatter the people in his final moments or make empty promises to gain their favor. Instead, Pericles spent his last breath urging his friends to uphold virtue and not give in to the people's desire for imperial greed. Plutarch says Pericles "expired in the arms of those who loved him, honored by all good men and regretted by his country." The respect and admiration surrounding Pericles' death show he did not pander to the crowd but acted with dignity and principle.

In conclusion, Plutarch uses the end of Pericles' life to respond to charges of demagoguery by highlighting his rational and judicious leadership during crisis, his steadfast dedication to the common good over his own self-interest, and his principled and dignified death. Through these events, Plutarch shows Pericles was no demagogue, but rather an honorable statesman who acted for the benefit of all citizens. His courage, virtue, and care for Athens shine through even in his final days.
