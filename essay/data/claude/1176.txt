British Steel operated in a challenging macro and industrial environment in the decades leading up to its merger with Hoogovens in 2001 to form Corus. Several factors in the external environment posed major difficulties for the company and impacted its strategic decisions during this time period. 

On the macro level, British Steel faced a declining domestic steel market in the UK due to a weakening manufacturing sector and increasing foreign competition. The UK joined the European Economic Community in 1973, opening up the British market to steel imports from other European producers with competitive advantages. At the same time, the British economy was shifting away from traditional heavy industries like steelmaking toward a service-based economy. This led to falling demand for British Steel's products in its home market.

In the global steel industry, there were also significant challenges. Overcapacity and price wars led to a flood of cheap steel imports into the UK market, undercutting British Steel. There were rapid technological changes in the industry reducing costs, particularly the rise of mini-mills and electric arc furnaces using scrap metal to produce steel at lower cost. British Steel had to invest heavily to upgrade equipment and restructure to remain competitive. They also faced more stringent environmental regulations, increasing costs.

To respond to these environmental challenges, British Steel embarked on a series of strategic initiatives. They pursued mergers and acquisitions to gain economies of scale, acquiring other UK and European steel producers. They also invested in new technologies like continuous casting to reduce costs, improve quality, and meet environmental standards. British Steel expanded into global markets to reduce dependence on the UK market, setting up joint ventures and partnerships in China, Thailand, and elsewhere. They diversified into related products like piping and railway tracks. However, these strategies were not enough, and the company struggled with periods of major financial losses and job cuts.

The merger with Hoogovens to form Corus in 2001 was aimed at achieving greater economies of scale and cost savings to remain competitive. However, Corus continued to face the same challenging environment. Key stakeholders like employees, shareholders, customers, and the British government were all concerned with Corus's viability and performance.
