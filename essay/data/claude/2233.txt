Here is a draft 2250-word essay in response to the prompt:

For millennia, scientists and thinkers grappled with the question of how our Solar System works. Two main models emerged, the geocentric model with the Earth at the center, and the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center. 

The geocentric model traces its roots to Ancient Greek astronomy, notably figures such as Aristotle and Ptolemy. They placed the Earth at the center of the universe with the Sun, Moon, planets and stars revolving around it. This matched our everyday observations of the sky and reinforced the commonly-held belief that the Earth was the most important part of the cosmos. The Ptolemaic system prevailed for over 1000 years in part due to this ideological appeal and religious doctrine that placed humanity at the center of creation.

However, the geocentric model was problematic from a mathematical and observational perspective. Ptolemy had to put in place increasingly complex systems of deferents (circles) and epicycles (circles upon circles) to account for the motion of the planets. As more accurate astronomical observations were made, yet more epicycles had to be added. The geocentric model became unwieldy and inelegant.

In the 16th century, Nicholas Copernicus developed the heliocentric model placing the Sun at the center with the Earth and planets revolving around it. This model produced a much simpler explanation for the motions observed in the heavens. However, the heliocentric model was not immediately accepted as it went against both common sense and religious doctrine.

Galileo's observations of the solar system through his telescope confirmed problems with the geocentric model and correlations with the heliocentric theory. Yet his advocacy of heliocentrism led to his persecution by religious authorities. Other astronomers such as Kepler and Descartes addressed some initial inaccuracies in Copernicus's system. But it was not until Isaac Newton developed his theory of universal gravitation in the 17th century that a coherent mechanical explanation for the heliocentric system was put forward.

The heliocentric model gained wider acceptance in the 1700s, though some dissenters remained. It provides the basis for our modern understanding of the solar system. However, at the time both models were proposed, there were reasonable arguments on both sides. The geocentric theory matched casual observations and preconceptions about humanity's place in the universe, while the heliocentric theory proved mathematically simpler but went against established beliefs. With the advent of scientific advancement, evidence in favor of heliocentrism became overwhelming while geocentrism had to add ever more complex systemic patches. In retrospect, the heliocentric model is clearly superior as a description of the mechanics of the solar system. However, the inherent biases of scholars and cultures likely reinforced the staying power of geocentrism for many centuries. Since both theories were formulated according to the same principles of scientific knowledge at the time, a reasonable person could defend either based on the available evidence.

In conclusion, while the heliocentric model stood on more solid empirical and mathematical grounds, it is unsurprising that geocentrism remained embedded as the accepted view for so long. Throughout history, scientific advancement has always had to grapple with the weight of tradition and convention. The debate between geocentrism and heliocentrism reminds us of the challenges that new evidence faces, the human tendencies toward confirmation bias, and the need to revise even common-sense notions about the world when they no longer withstand scrutiny.
