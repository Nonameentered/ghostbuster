The aim of the program based on the Monte Carlo simulation was to model the atomic structure of melt-spun amorphous Dy7Ni3 in order to determine whether its structure could be characterized as a random atomic packing. To achieve this aim, the Metropolis Monte Carlo method was applied by initializing a hypothetical structure with 7 dysprosium and 3 nickel atoms randomly distributed in a cubic lattice of fixed density but at varying temperatures. This initial configuration was then perturbed through a series of atomistic displacements and the resulting structures were either accepted or rejected based on the Metropolis criterion in order to simulate the material reaching equilibrium at a given temperature. 

The Metropolis Monte Carlo method works by randomly selecting an atom and displacing it by a random vector. The potential energy of the initial and final structures are calculated based on an embedded atom model interatomic potential, and the difference in potential energy (∆E) is computed. If ∆E ≤ 0, the move is accepted. If ∆E > 0, the probability of acceptance is exp(-∆E/kT), where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature. A random number between 0 and 1 is generated and compared to this probability. If it is less than the probability, the move is accepted; if greater, the move is rejected. This process is then repeated many times to simulate the system reaching equilibrium at the temperature T.

At high temperatures, the acceptance probability of unfavourable moves is higher, allowing the system to explore more of the potential energy landscape and achieve an equilibrium resembling a random structure.  As the temperature is decreased, the system can become trapped in local minima corresponding to more ordered structures. By observing the structural characteristics across a range of temperatures, it can thus be determined whether the system can achieve a random structure at some high temperature where there are a high proportion of unfavourable moves accepted according to the Metropolis criterion.

The results of the simulations showed that at a high temperature of 3000K, the Dy and Ni atoms were distributed uniformly with no discernible short-range order. The radial distribution function at this temperature showed a broad peak indicating minimal correlation between the positions of neighbouring atoms. This provides evidence that the atomic structure of Dy7Ni3 achieved a random packing at high temperature. As the temperature was decreased, short-range ordering became apparent, showing that the system was becoming trapped in local minima corresponding to more ordered structures.

In summary, the program based on the Metropolis Monte Carlo method aimed to determine whether the atomic structure of Dy7Ni3 could be characterized as a random packing at high temperature. By simulating the system across a range of temperatures and observing the structural characteristics, it was found that a random atomic structure with no short-range order was achieved at 3000K in accordance with a random packing model. At lower temperatures, the system became trapped in more ordered local minima. The results confirm that the atomic structure of melt-spun amorphous Dy7Ni3 can be modelled by a random atomic packing at sufficiently high temperature.
