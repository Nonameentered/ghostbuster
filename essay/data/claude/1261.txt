Micromorphology is the study of microscopic sediments and structures in soils and archaeological materials. It provides insights into site formation processes and human activities that may not be obvious from macroscopic analysis alone. By examining soil sediments and floors at a microscopic scale, micromorphology can identify microartefacts, microscopic traces of human activity, that shed light on how spaces were used and the activities that were conducted in a building.

For example, the examination of floor sediments from a kitchen area may reveal the presence of microscopic food remains such as starch granules, phytoliths from vegetables and cereals, and charred organic remains. The types of microartefacts present could indicate specific foods that were prepared and cooked in the space, suggesting the area functioned as a kitchen. The concentrations and distributions of these materials across the floor can also provide clues to the locations of work surfaces, hearths, and activity areas in the room.  

Microscopic soil components are also influenced by the ways soils and floors were constructed, maintained, and altered over time. High amounts of burnt remains, ash, and charcoal fragments may point to repeated burning of the floor, whether for construction, cleaning, or other purposes. Disturbance features such as cracks, aggregates of flooring material, or highly compacted and sorted areas can indicate paths, work surfaces, or other features of human use and occupation. For example, compacted earth with few inclusions may represent a well-used path across a floor, while a highly disturbed and mixed area with varied microartefacts may have functioned as a surface for food preparation or craft production.

The types of minerals, rock fragments, and clasts present in the floor sediment provide information on the source of raw construction materials and how they were deposited and finished. For example, layers of clay or plant temper may indicate maintenance of an earthen floor. Sandy or silty inclusions point to the application of other materials, whether for insulation, drainage, or to harden the floor surface. Differences in the materials and microstructures present can also distinguish occupation surfaces from construction layers or demolition debris.  

In summary, micromorphology provides a microscopic window into human activity through the analysis of floor sediments and microartefacts. By identifying and interpreting microremains of plants, animals, minerals, and anthropogenic materials, as well as disturbance features and soil structures, insights can be gained into the construction, use, and modification of buildings. Micromorphology offers a valuable approach for understanding spaces that may be difficult to interpret from macroscopic evidence alone. With careful sampling, the microscopic clues hidden within the floors of archaeological structures can be uncovered and revealed.
