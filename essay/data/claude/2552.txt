Here is a draft 2500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Horses are large animals with high dietary requirements, and as such can face several nutritional difficulties if not properly managed. Three key areas where horses can face challenges in meeting their nutritional needs include:

1. Insufficient Forage: Grass and hay (collectively known as forage) should make up the majority of a horse's diet. Most experts recommend that at least 50-75% of a horse's diet by weight should be forage. Forage provides not just calories but also essential fiber that keeps the digestive system working properly. Without sufficient forage, horses can face issues like ulcers, colic, and behavioral problems. To prevent this, stable managers should ensure that hay is available free choice for horses, and pasture time is provided when possible. Hay should be tested periodically to ensure it meets nutritional requirements. 

2. Inadequate Calories: For some horses, especially those that are young, old, or engaged in heavy work or performance, a diet of just forage may not provide enough calories to maintain body weight.  In these cases, the addition of grain and supplements is needed. However, too many calories can also be an issue, leading to obesity. Stable managers must carefully monitor each horse's body weight and condition score, and make adjustments to the amount and type of concentrate feed as needed to keep horses at an ideal weight. Regular weighing and body scoring are key tools that should be utilized.

3. Imbalanced Nutrition: A horse's diet must provide the correct amounts of protein, vitamins, and minerals to support all essential bodily functions. Diets lacking in certain nutrients can cause issues like developmental orthopedic disease in young horses, anemia, and poor hoof quality. To maintain balanced nutrition, high-quality forage and grain should be paired with a well-formulated vitamin/mineral supplement. Stable managers should follow feeding directions carefully and have hay and grain analyzed if any issues arise. 

In summary, meeting the nutritional needs of horses requires diligent stable management. Providing constant access to fresh, high-quality forage, monitoring body weight and condition, adjusting concentrate feeds as needed, and supplying a balanced vitamin/mineral supplement are all key practices that should be implemented to promote health and wellness in horses. With proper nutrition and management, stable managers can head off many potential difficulties horses may face.
