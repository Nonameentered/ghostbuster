Here is a draft essay of 2925 words in response to the prompt on differences between male and female speech and theories to explain them:

There are several noteworthy differences in the speech patterns and communication styles between men and women. These differences have been studied extensively by linguists, sociologists, and psychologists. In general, men's speech tends to be more direct and linear, focused on exchanging information, while women's speech tends to be more rapport-building and collaborative. Of course, there is much variation among individuals, so these are broad generalizations. But overall, several key differences in male vs. female speech have been identified.

One key difference is that women tend to use more words than men in speech. Studies show women speak, on average, about 6,000 to 8,000 words per day, while men speak about 2,000 to 4,000 words per day. Women also tend to use more elaborate and complex grammar, and employ a larger vocabulary. In multi-party conversations, men tend to talk more than women. However, in one-on-one conversations, women talk more than men, and also interrupt men more often. Several reasons are suggested for why women produce more words than men: women may have stronger verbal fluency and memory, may be more comfortable expressing thoughts and feelings verbally, and may feel more rapport can be built through more expansive conversations. 

Women also tend to use more questions than men and employ an interrogative style of speech. They ask more questions, especially "tag questions" like “isn't it?” or “don't you think?”, and use a rising intonation to turn statements into questions. This may reflect women's tendency to be more collaborative in conversation and seek connections. Men, on the other hand, tend to make more declarative statements and use an authoritative tone. 

Another difference is that women frequently use more intensive adjectives and qualifiers like "so", "very", and "really" to strengthen their statements. They also use more emotional language and expressive speech. Men, conversely, tend to use more blunt and direct speech. They are more likely to issue commands and make definitive judgments. This may reflect differences in showing emotion and building rapport.

 Other differences relate to turn-taking in conversations. Women are more likely to use responsive back-channeling, like saying "uh-huh" or "mm-hmm" while others talk to show they are listening. Women also use more polite interrupting, apologizing while interrupting the speaker. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to directly interrupt the speaker or remain silent while listening. These tendencies show women's preference for collaborative and supportive conversational styles.
