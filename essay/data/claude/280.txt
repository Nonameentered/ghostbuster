Here is a draft 1500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Journalists and political scientists approach reporting on political events in very different ways. Journalists necessarily focus on the story or issue of the day, conveying news to citizens and aiming to cover events in an engaging, thought-provoking way. Political scientists, on the other hand, apply a more academic, analytical lens. They seek to understand the workings of political systems and events in a comprehensive, objective manner. These differences in approach and purpose mean that journalists can often integrate personal opinions and biases into their reporting, whereas political scientists are expected to remain neutral and objective.

An example that illustrates these differences in approach is the media treatment of the Labour government's proposed extension of parental leave in 2005. At the time, the government proposed extending paid parental leave from 6 months to 9 months. Journalistic coverage of this policy proposal varied in terms of the perspectives and biases on display. Some journalists supported the extended leave, arguing it would benefit families and children. Others argued that it would be too costly for businesses or lead to workplace disruption. Many journalists also debated the merits of the proposal based on their own ideological views about the role of government and the balance between public assistance and business flexibility.

Political scientists, on the other hand, aimed to analyze the parental leave proposal through an objective, evidenced-based lens. They studied the potential costs and benefits of the policy based on academic research. They considered how similar policies had impacted other nations and evaluated if the government's proposal was an appropriate, well-considered policy response to the issue of supporting new parents. The goal was to understand the rationales and dimensions of the policy irrespective of any individual's ideological or partisan views. Neutral, fact-based analysis—not the expression of opinions—was the standard political scientists adhered to.

In conclusion, while journalists and political scientists overlap in their interest in politics and public policy, there are crucial differences in how they approach reporting on political events. Journalists naturally integrate their own perspectives and opinions into their coverage, seeking to craft engaging stories and debate issues, whereas political scientists aim for objective analysis based on evidence and research. Comparing media and academic treatments of the extended parental leave proposal in 2005 highlights how these differences in standards and approach manifest in practice. Overall, the complementary nature of journalism and political science provides citizens with both partisan debate and neutral analysis on the politics that shape democracies and societies.
