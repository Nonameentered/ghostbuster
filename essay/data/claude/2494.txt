The recent dietary survey conducted on 500 students at Despite University revealed some interesting findings about the nutrition and wholesomeness of the students' diets. Overall, the survey found that while students are consuming calories that could sustain them, the sources of those calories are not optimal and could lead to various nutritional deficiencies or other health issues if continued long-term.  

The survey found that a majority of students, over 60%, eat at fast food restaurants several times a week. Fast food is high in calories, fat, and sugar but low in nutrients. Students who regularly eat fast food tended to consume more calories but fewer servings of fruits and vegetables, and less dietary fiber than recommended. They also consumed higher amounts of saturated fat and added sugar. Eating too much fast food and not enough nutritious foods like fruits and vegetables can lead to weight gain and increase the risk of health issues like type 2 diabetes or heart disease over time.

Another finding was that college students tend to snack frequently but the types of snacks chosen are often highly processed or pre-made snacks like chips, cookies, or granola bars rather than fresh fruit, nuts, or yogurt. These pre-made snacks are high in calories, salt, fat, and sugar but low in nutrients. Snacking on nutritious food in moderation can absolutely be part of a healthy diet, but students would benefit from relying less on premade, packaged snacks and instead choosing minimally processed, nutritious snack options.  

Finally, the survey found that over 80% of students skip at least 2 meals per week, most often breakfast. Breakfast is touted as the most important meal of the day, and studies show that eating breakfast regularly leads to lower body weight and improved concentration. Students would benefit from establishing a routine where they enjoy a healthy, balanced breakfast before starting their day.

In summary, while the students at Despite University are consuming enough calories to meet their basic energy needs, the sources of those calories—heavy reliance on fast food, pre-made snacks, and skipping nutritious meals—do not constitute a wholesome or healthy diet. Making small improvements, like cooking more meals at home, choosing more nutritious snack options, and never skipping breakfast could go a long way toward improving students' health, nutrition, and overall well-being. The dietary survey reveals opportunities for nutritional education to help students develop better habits and a healthier relationship with food as they navigate the fast-paced college lifestyle.
