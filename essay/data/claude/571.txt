Pluto Telecommunications faces several significant problems that threaten the viability of the company if left unaddressed. In the short term, the company's cash flow issues and high debt levels are problematic. Pluto Telecommunications has seen declining revenue and profits over the last few quarters leading to concerns about its ability to service its $2 billion in debt. The high interest payments on the debt are also reducing available cash for investment in updated infrastructure and new products. 

To address these short-term issues, Pluto Telecommunications should look to cut costs through reducing operating expenses and staffing levels. The company should also look to sell non-essential assets to raise cash and pay down some portion of its debt. Interest payments can also be lowered by renegotiating with lenders to lower interest rates or extend payment timelines. These short-term moves can stabilize the company's finances and buy some time.

In the longer term, Pluto Telecommunications needs to overhaul its business strategy and operating model to adapt to changes in the telecommunications industry. Transitioning from a traditional landline phone and internet provider to providing mobile, data, and entertainment services is critical for future growth. Investing in high-speed broadband infrastructure to support new digital services should be a priority. Merging with or acquiring other companies to gain new capabilities and reach new customers could also be part of a longer-term solution.   

The problems Pluto Telecommunications faces are significant but surmountable. Through a combination of short-term cost cutting and financial restructuring along with a longer-term strategy shift to new digital services and offerings, the company can turn itself around. The short-term solutions provide financial breathing room while the long-term changes reinvent the company for the modern era. Executing on this dual approach will require resolve and a willingness to make difficult decisions, but is the only way forward for Pluto Telecommunications given the scale of the challenges it faces. With a concerted effort across the whole company, Pluto Telecommunications can overcome its current problems and work to rebuild a successful and sustainable business.
