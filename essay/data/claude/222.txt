Quine's naturalized epistemology urges us to abandon traditional epistemological questions about justification of knowledge in favor of empirical investigation into the workings of science and cognition. Quine argues that traditional epistemology centered around justification is misguided. Its questions cannot be answered satisfactorily and it does not provide much insight into how knowledge is actually achieved or the workings of science. 

According to Quine, epistemology should not focus on normative questions about what makes beliefs justified or knowledge. Rather, it should focus on naturalistic questions about how beliefs and knowledge emerge from natural psychological and physical processes. Epistemology should be continuous with natural science, studying knowledge and belief as natural phenomena in the world, not something normative. Quine suggests epistemology should study how sensory stimulation, psychology, and scientific method interact to produce knowledge and beliefs. This naturalized epistemology would be empirical, based on observation and scientific method, rather than a priori conceptual analysis.

Quine argues traditional epistemology is problematic for several reasons. First, the concepts of evidence and justification it relies on are unclear and disputable. There are many competing theories of justification but no consensus on which is correct. Second, traditional epistemology seeks a foundation for knowledge, but Quine argues no certain foundation exists. All beliefs depend on other beliefs, so we end up with coherence rather than foundations. Finally, the normative questions of traditional epistemology, like what we ought to believe or what makes a belief justified, do not connect clearly with descriptive facts and the actual progress of science. Naturalized epistemology avoids these problems by focusing on how beliefs are formed and justified in practice.

Quine's naturalized epistemology has significant philosophical implications. It rejects notions like epistemic norms or "epistemic duty," as well as foundationalism. It is also consistent with Quine's broader naturalism and empiricism across philosophy. However, some argue normative epistemology still has value and should not be abandoned. For example, it could still aim at ideals of rationality and help evaluate or improve belief formation. Others argue naturalized epistemology cannot replace traditional epistemology because philosophy has a normative element. Despite Quine's arguments, questions about what we should believe remain philosophically important and distinct from purely descriptive questions.

In conclusion, Quine makes a strong case for naturalizing epistemology, but normative epistemology likely still has value despite his criticisms. Naturalized epistemology provides important insights into how knowledge arises naturally from psychology and science, insights normative epistemology misses. However, ideal rationality and normative questions seem inescapable in epistemology, even if they are difficult to connect clearly with natural facts. Both naturalized and traditional epistemology satisfy intellectual curiosity and likely will advance our understanding in tandem rather than requiring us to embrace one instead of the other. Ultimately, a combination of normative and naturalized approaches may yield the most comprehensive epistemology.
