Here is a 735-word essay in response to the prompt:

Connectionism is an approach to modeling learning in the mind and brain. It emphasizes the interconnected nature  of neural networks in the brain and how those connections change over time based on experience. In connectionism, learning emerges from the interactions of these neural networks, rather than being driven by preexisting rules. Connectionism has been influential in developing our modern understanding of how children acquire language. 

In language acquisition, connectionism suggests that children are not born with a predetermined set of linguistic rules or structures in their brain. Instead, language ability emerges from neural connections that form through exposure to language input. As children hear more language, the connections between neurons representing language elements like sounds, word forms, and semantic concepts become stronger. These connection strengths determine a child's language knowledge and ability.

Several key principles of connectionism are relevant for language teaching. First, connectionism emphasizes the importance of substantial input. The neural connections that underlie language ability are formed through exposure to language, so providing large amounts of comprehensible input is critical. The more input students receive, the more connections will form and strengthen.

Second, connectionism suggests that grammar is acquired implicitly through input, rather than through direct instruction. Exposing students to proper examples of language forms and structures, in context, helps them develop internalized grammatical knowledge. Overtly teaching grammar rules may be less useful, as these abstract rules must still be mapped onto the connections formed from experience. However, grammar instruction could help students notice forms in input, facilitating the connection-forming process.

Finally, in connectionism, the meaning of language is represented by the connections between forms and concepts. Therefore, assisting students in making connections between the language they are exposed to and personal experiences or situations helps to strengthen the semantic connections that give language meaning. Using visual aids, gestures, situational cues, and personalized examples are techniques that can help forge these meaning-based connections.  

In summary, the connectionist perspective suggests that language acquisition is an emergent process that arises from experience. Substantial input, implicit learning of grammar, and facilitation of meaning connections are key principles that can guide effective language teaching. By applying these principles, we can create learning environments that align with the natural processes through which the mind and brain acquire language ability over time through use and experience.
