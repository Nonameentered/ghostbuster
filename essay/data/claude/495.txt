How HIV/AIDS Impacts Economic Development in Non-OECD Countries 

HIV/AIDS has had a devastating impact on economic growth and development in non-OECD countries over the past several decades. This essay examines how HIV prevalence levels and primary school completion rates relate to average annual economic growth rates across 50 non-OECD countries. The analysis finds that higher HIV prevalence and lower primary school completion are associated with slower economic growth on average.

The sample of 50 non-OECD countries shows a wide range of HIV prevalence levels, from 0.1% in some Asian and Middle Eastern countries up to 25-30% in some sub-Saharan African countries. The average HIV prevalence across all 50 countries is 3.8%. However, the 22 "faster-growing" countries, with average annual GDP growth over 3% per year, have an average HIV prevalence of just 1.9%. The 28 "slower-growing" countries, with average growth under 3%, have an average HIV prevalence of 5.7%. This suggests HIV/AIDS has placed a substantial drag on economic growth and development.

Primary school completion rates also vary widely, from under 50% in some African countries to over 95% in parts of Asia. The overall average is 78% across the 50 countries. The faster-growing group of countries averages 84% primary school completion, while the slower-growing group averages just 73%. This indicates that lack of access to basic education, especially for girls and women, contributes to higher HIV transmission and slower economic growth.

Further analysis of the frequency distributions of HIV prevalence levels and primary school completion rates shows that the majority of faster-growing countries have HIV prevalence under 3% and primary school completion over 80%. In contrast, the majority of slower-growing countries have HIV prevalence over 3% and primary school completion under 80%. This provides further evidence that countries with lower HIV and higher schooling tend to achieve faster economic growth.

In summary, higher HIV prevalence and lower primary school completion are strongly associated with slower economic growth and development across these 50 non-OECD countries. Tackling HIV/AIDS through improved access to education and healthcare is thus vital not only for public health reasons but to enable developing countries to achieve their full economic potential. Investing in the health and education of citizens pays economic dividends and is fundamental to growth and prosperity.
