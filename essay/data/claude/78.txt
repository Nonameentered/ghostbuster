Here is a draft essay in 2000 words:

The Catholic Church on the eve of the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century faced a number of criticisms that contributed to a changing climate of opinion against it. These included criticisms of the clergy, the papacy, certain doctrines and practices of the Church. The Church at the time exercised significant political and social influence in Europe, but these criticisms served to undermine its legitimacy and authority.

One major criticism was directed at the corruption and abuses committed by the clergy. The clergy were often criticized for being more focused on enjoying lavish lifestyles and accumulating power and wealth, rather than pious devotion or spiritual leadership. They held political positions and gained wealth through pluralism, benefices, and collection of ecclesiastical dues. They were also criticized for failing to educate laypeople and set good moral examples. These criticisms called their spiritual authority into questions, especially since they claimed exemptions from taxes and legal prosecution. 

The papacy itself was criticized for its worldliness and political machinations. The popes, especially during the Renaissance, were ambitious secular rulers who waged wars, sponsored the arts, and lived extravagant lives like temporal monarchs. They were accused of neglecting spiritual duties for political gains. The papacy's politicking and nepotism were seen as contradicting Christ's teachings. The reputation and credibility of the papacy were seriously damaged, especially after events like the Western Schism and era of multiple popes.

Some Catholic doctrines and practices were criticized as lacking scriptural justification. The sale of indulgences, for instance, was seen as merely a money-making scheme that allowed people to buy forgiveness and salvation. Prayers for the dead were seen as useless. Vatican bureaucracy and Canon law were viewed as artificial and legalistic accretions. Clerical celibacy was criticized as unnatural. Laypeople resented not being allowed to read the Bible in their own languages. 

In conclusion, the rising tide of criticisms concerning the clergy, papacy, doctrines and practices proved hugely damaging to the functioning and reputation of the Catholic Church in the early 16th century. They contributed to a climate of demands for reform and set the stage for the Protestant Reformation that was to follow. The Church's moral authority and dominance were clearly weakened, as people questioned its institutions, leadership and theology like never before.
