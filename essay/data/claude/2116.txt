Here is a draft essay in 1500 words on the prompt:

Is Medea a figure of male nightmares or is she more than that? Analyze the character in terms of a literary creation and as a statement on the roles and treatment of women in Athens during the 5th century.

Medea is one of the most complex and intriguing characters in all of Greek mythology. As depicted in Euripides' famous play Medea, she is a figure that inspires fear and fascination. On the one hand, Medea embodies many of the anxieties that Greek men, and Athenian men in particular, had about powerful, clever women. She uses her intelligence and magic to manipulate and harm others, making her a nightmare figure. 

However, Medea is more than just a one-dimensional villain. She is a layered and sympathetic character who acts out of deep pain, anger, and the desire for justice and revenge. While her actions are cruel and morally questionable, Euripides makes her motives and emotions understandable to the audience. Medea is a woman wronged by a man's betrayal and is left powerless and alone due to her social position. As a woman in 5th-century Athens, she has no political or legal power to protect herself. She only has her intelligence and magic to turn to for justice.

Medea's pursuit of vengeance through the brutal murders of Creon, Glauce, and her own children is horrific and cast her as a fearsome monster. However, her inhuman actions come about because of a human frailty that any member of the audience could understand: the desire to avenge one's wounded heart. By showing that even a powerful female figure like Medea is driven by the deepest human emotions and vulnerabilities, Euripides adds a layer of humanity and empathy to her character. While she is a nightmare, she is one shaped by the all-too-human dream of love and revenge.

At the same time, Medea's character provides social commentary on the status and treatment of women in 5th-century Athens. As a foreign "barbarian" woman in a male-dominated society, Medea has almost no agency or power over her own life and fate. Her only value comes through her relationship to a man, first as a daughter and then as a wife. When Jason abandons her to marry another, Medea loses her only source of status and security. She is a woman alone, which leaves her completely vulnerable in the eyes of society. Her desire for justice stems from this lack of power and control over her life that all women in Athens experienced.

In the end, Medea is a complex and rich character that represents both a patriarchal nightmare of female power and a commentary on the disenfranchisement of women. While her actions are violent and vengeful, they arise from the deepest pains that any human, regardless of gender, can experience: heartbreak, betrayal, loneliness, and powerlessness. Medea becomes a monster, but she is one of our own making, built from familiar human frailties and desires in an unfamiliar form. She haunts us still because in her we see shadows of ourselves.
