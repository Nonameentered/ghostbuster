Here is a 1751-word essay in response to the prompt:

Antidumping policies within the GATT/WTO framework, especially as applied to agricultural products, have been controversial and subject to varying opinions. On the one hand, antidumping duties are seen as a legitimate tool by governments to protect domestic industries from unfair foreign competition and predatory pricing practices.  However, others argue that antidumping policies are often misused as a cover for protectionism and undermine free trade principles. This essay will explore the history and evolution of antidumping policies within the GATT/WTO system, analyze criticisms and proposed reforms of current policies, consider the proliferation of antidumping legislation among WTO members, and discuss the particular vulnerability of agricultural exports to antidumping actions.  

Antidumping policies have been incorporated into the international trading system since the early 20th century. The first antidumping code was established in the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The WTO Antidumping Agreement emerged from the Uruguay Round negotiations and replaced the earlier GATT code, expanding and clarifying rules surrounding the use of antidumping duties. The stated objective was to condemn predatory pricing practices while also ensuring fair competition and trade liberalization. However, in practice, the usage of antidumping policies has accelerated rapidly, especially since the 1990s. As of 2018, all but one WTO member had an active antidumping law, and over 5,000 antidumping measures were in effect worldwide.  

Critics argue that the majority of modern antidumping cases amount to disguised protectionism rather than legitimate responses to unfair trade practices. Duties are frequently imposed without clear evidence that dumped imports caused injury or that there was predatory intent. The convoluted rules around price comparisons and impact assessments are prone to manipulation. Antidumping has also become an increasingly politicized issue, rather than a purely economic one. Some analysts propose tighter disciplines and higher standards of evidence within WTO rules to curb abuse. Others suggest limiting the use of antidumping in sectors, like agriculture, that receive high levels of government support. 

Agricultural goods have been an area of active debate because they are frequently subjected to antidumping duties despite also receiving domestic subsidies and protection. Agricultural exports from developing countries are especially vulnerable. The "value-to-weight" ratio of many agricultural goods means that even small duties can make a product uncompetitive. At the same time, developing country exporters rarely have the capacity to mount challenges against unfair antidumping rulings. Many analysts argue that agricultural sectors should be exempt from antidumping laws altogether, or subject to more flexible rules of application.

In conclusion, antidumping policies have a complex and controversial history within the GATT/WTO system, especially relating to agricultural trade. There are reasonable arguments on both sides of this issue, but many experts suggest that antidumping rules require reform to uphold principles of fair competition and free trade. Limiting the use of duties in politically sensitive sectors like agriculture could help curb protectionism while still allowing governments to take action against genuinely predatory practices. Overall, more nuanced and disciplined application of antidumping laws will be needed to balance trade and economic interests as the global economy becomes increasingly integrated.
