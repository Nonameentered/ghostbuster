Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is a type of cancer that affects the lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Lymphocytes are an important part of the immune system and help fight infections in the body. In CLL, the lymphocytes grow in an uncontrolled way and accumulate in the bone marrow, blood, and lymph nodes. This prevents the normal and healthy production of new lymphocytes. CLL is the most common form of leukaemia diagnosed in adults in Western countries.

CLL often causes no symptoms early on and is usually detected during routine blood tests. As it progresses, common symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, and loss of appetite. Swollen lymph nodes, especially in the neck, underarms, and groin area, are also frequently seen. If the bone marrow is infiltrated by cancerous lymphocytes, it may lead to a drop in red blood cell and platelet counts, resulting in anaemia and increased bleeding or bruising. Infection also becomes more likely due to depleted healthy white blood cells. However, CLL often has a slow progression over many years with periods of remission where symptoms improve or disappear. 

To diagnose CLL, blood tests, bone marrow biopsies, imaging tests, and immunophenotyping are commonly used. A complete blood count often shows an increase in white blood cell count and a drop in red blood cell and platelet levels. Examining a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy under the microscope will reveal infiltrated lymphocytes that are morphologically small and mature-appearing. Flow cytometry, a type of immunophenotyping, helps confirm the monoclonal origin of these malignant B-lymphocytes. Imaging such as computed tomography (CT) scans check for any swollen lymph nodes in the body. These tests together can conclusively determine a CLL diagnosis.

There is currently no cure for CLL, but it can often be well managed to relieve symptoms and slow down progression. Treatment options depend on the stage of the cancer based on physical examination, blood tests, and imaging. Patients with early stage cancer and no symptoms may not require immediate treatment and are monitored regularly. Chemotherapy, which uses cytotoxic drugs to destroy cancer cells, is a common treatment for moderate and advanced stage CLL. Common drugs for CLL include fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. Radiation therapy may be used to shrink enlarged lymph nodes. Biological therapy such as monoclonal antibodies can be used alone or with chemotherapy. Targeted drugs such as ibrutinib that attack specific vulnerabilities of CLL cells are also increasingly used for CLL treatment. For patients in good health with aggressive CLL, stem cell transplantation may potentially provide long term remission.

In summary, CLL is a type of chronic leukaemia characterised by the accumulation of small, mature-appearing lymphocytes. It is usually detected through routine blood testing before the onset of significant symptoms. To confirm the diagnosis, blood tests, bone marrow biopsies, imaging, and immunophenotyping are performed. Although CLL remains incurable, it can often be well managed for many years with regular monitoring and treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted drugs, and stem cell transplants in selected patients. With ongoing research, new treatment options continue to improve remission rates and survival for this chronic cancer.
