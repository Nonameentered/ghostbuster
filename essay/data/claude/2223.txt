The theory that the universe is expanding has been supported by numerous observations and discoveries over the past century. The first evidence for expansion came from observations by the astronomer Edwin Hubble in the 1920s. Using the world's largest telescope at the time, the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, Hubble was able to observe individual stars in distant galaxies. He noticed that the light from most galaxies was redshifted, meaning that the wavelength of the light was stretched towards the red end of the spectrum. This redshift could be explained by the Doppler effect if galaxies were moving away from us. Hubble plotted the distances and redshifts of galaxies and found a clear relationship - the more distant a galaxy was, the more its light was redshifted. This relationship, now known as Hubble's law, supported the idea that the universe is expanding with galaxies moving away from each other. 

Further evidence for an expanding universe came from the discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation in 1964. This radio signal coming from all directions in space corresponds to the leftover radiation from the hot early universe. The CMB is nearly uniform in all directions but shows very small temperature variations. These tiny fluctuations correspond to density variations in the early universe that gave rise to all the structure we see today - galaxies, stars, planets, etc. For the CMB to exist, the early universe must have been hot and dense, and then gradually cooled and expanded as the universe aged. The CMB confirms a key prediction of the Big Bang theory, that the universe began extremely hot and dense and has been expanding and cooling ever since.

While we have significant evidence for an expanding universe, our knowledge is still limited by the finite speed of light and the amount of time we have been able to observe the universe. We can only see light from regions of space that has had time to reach us, so we are limited to observing objects up to about 46 billion light years away. However, the actual size of the universe is far greater than the observable universe. We are also limited to observing the universe over the short timescale of a human lifetime. If dark energy causes the expansion of the universe to accelerate over cosmic time, there are likely future events and phenomena beyond our current comprehension. With improved tools and technology, astronomers will continue to gain new insights into the expansion of the universe and its ultimate fate. But we remain hampered by the finite capabilities of humanity relative to the immense scale of the cosmos.
