The Reward System in the Mammalian Brain 

The concept of a reward system in the mammalian nervous system has been studied for decades and is commonly understood as consisting of a network of sites in the brain that govern reward processing and motivated behavior. Research into the neuroscientific underpinnings of reward has implicated several neurotransmitters, especially dopamine, as well as specific brain regions like the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex as key nodes in the reward process. However, emerging evidence suggests the existence of complex interacting systems with distinct but overlapping functions tied to reward generation, calling into question the notion of a single centralized reward system.

Dopamine has been termed the primary neurotransmitter of reward due to its role in signaling reward prediction and processing rewards. Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area project to the nucleus accumbens, a region in the ventral striatum, and release dopamine in response to rewards or cues predicting rewards. This phasic dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens is associated with feelings of pleasure and reinforcement learning. However, while dopamine is necessary for normal reward processing, it alone is not sufficient, and other neurotransmitters such as endocannabinoids, opioids, and GABA also modulate reward circuitry and rewarding experiences.

Two of the most well-studied reward-related brain regions are the ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens, and the orbitofrontal cortex. The ventral striatum has been shown using fMRI and electrode stimulation studies in humans and animals to activate in response to rewards, reward-predicting cues, and pleasant stimuli. The orbitofrontal cortex also plays an important role in assigning value to rewards and reward predictors and using this information to guide motivated behavior and decision making. Intracranial stimulation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, including the orbitofrontal cortex, in humans elicits feelings of pleasure, mirth, relaxation, and reward, indicating its role in generating conscious rewards sensations and affect.

However, characterizing reward processing as a single system centered on the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex fails to capture the diversity and nuance of rewards and the mechanisms underlying them in the brain. For example, different rewards like food, money, and social interaction are processed in partially distinct circuits with different neurotransmitter involvement. The psychological components of reward like pleasure, motivation, and desire also involve differing neural substrates and are dissociable at the behavioral and neural levels. Pleasure seems most closely tied to activity in the nucleus accumbens and opioid system, while motivation and desire follow dopamine signaling in the ventral tegmental area and ventral striatum.

In conclusion, while certain neurotransmitters like dopamine and brain regions including the ventral striatum are clearly necessary for normal reward functioning, the notion of a single reward system in the mammalian brain is an oversimplification that fails to reflect the diversity of rewards and psychological components of the reward process. A more accurate perspective recognizes interacting yet distinguishable circuits for different classes of rewards as well as pleasure, motivation, and desire. Intracranial stimulation and other research has been integral to unraveling this complexity, but continued study is still needed to fully understand the generation of reward in the mammalian nervous system.
