Law's Gender Neutrality: A Fictional Construct

The legal system operates under the pretense that the law is gender neutral - that legal rules and doctrine treat men and women equally. However, this notion of law's gender neutrality is a fictional construct that masks the ways in which law has historically discriminated against and continues to disadvantage women in a number of areas. Feminist legal theory has emerged to expose the false assumptions underlying law's supposed gender neutrality and argue for reforms to remedy the harms that the legal system inflicts upon women.  

One area in which the supposedly gender neutral law has failed women is in its treatment of violence against women, particularly domestic violence and sexual assault. Historically, the law did not recognize domestic violence or marital rape, and reflected the view that the male head of household had a right to physically discipline his wife. Although laws have changed, there are still problems with enforcement. Police often do not take domestic violence seriously, prosecutors undercharge these crimes, and judges hand down lenient sentences, reflecting a culture that is more tolerant of violence against women. Laws on sexual assault also reflect problematic societal views, with requirements for "utmost" resistance, and defenses like she was dressed provocatively. Feminists argue laws and enforcement must change to take these violent crimes seriously.

Law's treatment of reproductive rights and healthcare has also disproportionately negatively impacted women. Women have historically had little legal control over their reproductive health, with limited access to birth control and abortion. And healthcare systems focus on the needs of males, often denying agency and control to women over their own bodies and medical care. Feminists argue for women's rights to make their own reproductive health decisions and for healthcare institutions that are responsive to women's specific needs. 

Women have also faced discrimination in the workplace, from unequal pay and opportunities for career advancement to sexual harassment. While laws aim to remedy workplace inequities such as Title VII and the Equal Pay Act, enforcement has been lacking. And doctrines like the "reasonable woman" standard in harassment law reflect the fact that male standards dominate law. Feminists argue for stronger enforcement and a recognition that women's experiences merit legal protection.

In the family sphere as well, law has privileged men's interests over women's. For example, historically men had sole control over family property and custody of children. Even today, women face discrimination in child custody disputes. And the ideal worker paradigm that promotes long work hours reflects a male model of work, making it difficult for women to progress in their careers while also acting as the primary caretakers for home and family. Feminists push for law to recognize the challenges women face in balancing work and family and for more egalitarian rules regarding child custody and family responsibilities.

In conclusion, while law aims to be gender neutral, in reality it has reflected and reinforced the unequal treatment of women. Through exposing the harms that law and policy have inflicted on women and advocating for laws and enforcement practices that protect against discrimination, promote women's control over their lives and health, and balance work and family responsibilities, feminist legal theory challenges law to better fulfill the promise of equality and justice for all. Overall, feminist legal theory's impact has moved the legal system in a more equitable direction, but further progress is still needed to remedy discrimination and disadvantage.
