Chimpanzees, as our closest living relatives, share many cognitive and social characteristics with humans. However, humans are unique in our ability to acquire and utilize complex language systems. While chimpanzees can demonstrate some basic linguistic abilities, human language far outstrips that of chimps in several key areas. 

One key property of human language is duality, the ability to combine smaller meaningful parts like morphemes and phonemes into larger meaningful units like words and sentences. Chimpanzee communication lacks this generative, rule-governed quality. Their calls and gestures, while sophisticated, do not combine according to complex rules to create novel meaning. Humans, on the other hand, have an open-ended set of words and a grammar that allows infinite new sentence combinations.

A second key feature of human language is displacement, the ability to communicate about things and events that are removed in space and time. While chimps can communicate about immediate stimuli or events in the present environment, they struggle with communicating about past or future events removed from the here and now. Human language, on the other hand, allows us to discuss complex hypothetical scenarios, tell detailed stories about past events, and make elaborate plans for the future. This gives humans a level of mental "time travel" that chimps do not demonstrate.

Human language also demonstrates open-endedness, the quality of having a potentially infinite set of possible utterances. The lexicon and syntax of human language allows for the continuous creation of new words, concepts, metaphors, and sentence forms. Chimpanzee communication, while complex, consists of a fixed, closed set of calls, gestures, and combinations. They do not demonstrate the open-ended generativity of human language that allows for constant innovation. 

Finally, human language exhibits a high degree of stimulus freedom, meaning that the form or content of an utterance does not have to be directly prompted by the immediate environment or circumstance. Humans can talk or sign about anything at any time, unprompted by external stimuli. Chimp communication, on the other hand, tends to be highly context-dependent and elicited by environmental or social prompts. They do not spontaneously discuss abstract topics or communicate for the sheer social joy of it like humans do.

In conclusion, while chimpanzees exhibit some basic linguistic capacities, human language far outstrips chimp communication in its open-endedness, duality, displacement, and stimulus freedom. The uniqueness of human language underlies many of the advanced cognitive and social abilities that make us human. Understanding how human language evolved from more primitive primate communication systems is a fascinating topic, with many unanswered questions remaining for future research.
