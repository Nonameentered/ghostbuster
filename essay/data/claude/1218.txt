Solar flares are giant explosions in the sun's atmosphere. They are caused by sudden magnetic activities that release huge amounts of energy. The released energy mostly comprises high energy particles and electromagnetic radiation. When the earth is in the path of a solar flare's energy release, it can have significant effects on our planet.

One of the major effects of solar flares is interference with radio communications on Earth. The electromagnetic radiation from solar flares can disrupt radio signals that travel through the atmosphere. This can jam radio communications over certain frequency bands for durations that correspond to the intensity of the solar flare. Navigation systems that rely on radio signals, like GPS, can also be temporarily disrupted. These radio blackouts from solar flares usually only last a few minutes to a couple hours but can impact services like emergency response communications, air traffic control operations, and mobile phones.

Solar flares can also damage electrical infrastructure on Earth like power grids. The high energy particles from solar flares interact with the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere to induce electric currents. These geomagnetically induced currents flow through power lines and can overheat transformers and other components of the power grid. Major solar flares have caused power outages in the past that have left millions of people without electricity for extended periods. Utility companies are working to build more resilience into power grids to limit the potential impacts of these space weather events.  

While solar flares pose risks to technology and infrastructure, they are also linked to potentially dangerous radiation exposure for astronauts, high altitude pilots, and passengers on commercial space flights. The high energy particles from major solar flares can damage cells and DNA, especially when exposure occurs during space missions outside the protection of Earth's magnetic field. New space vehicles and spacesuits are being designed with additional shielding to better protect astronauts from the radiation risks of solar flares during spacewalks and missions to the moon or Mars.

In summary, solar flares release intense electromagnetic radiation and high energy particles that can jam radio communications, damage power grids, and pose radiation hazards to space and high altitude operations. Although the effects are often temporary, space weather monitoring systems constantly observe the sun to provide early warnings about solar flares and help technology systems prepare for and mitigate impacts. Ongoing improvements in infrastructure hardening and space exploration technology aim to reduce vulnerability to the adverse effects that the sun's explosive events can have on human activities.
