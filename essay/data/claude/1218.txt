Multi-strategy research, which combines quantitative and qualitative research methods, has both significant strengths and important limitations in addressing complex social research questions. On the one hand, using mixed methods allows researchers to harness the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative approaches while offsetting their weaknesses. Combining methods can provide more comprehensive evidence, capture different aspects of the same phenomenon, validate and corroborate findings, and thus produce more robust conclusions. 

However, multi-strategy research also has limitations and challenges. Combining methods often requires expertise in both quantitative and qualitative research, which not all researchers possess. There are also philosophical differences between quantitative and qualitative paradigms that can be difficult to reconcile. The analysis and integration of findings from different methods can be challenging and time-consuming. Multi-strategy research may also face issues related to power, including whose perspectives are prioritized and how the relationship between quantitative and qualitative findings is framed.

Two case studies that illustrate these strengths and limitations are a study by Creswell and Plano Clark (2011) on the experiences of first-generation college students and a study by Algozzine et al. (2003) on inclusive education. In the first study, the researchers used a survey to analyze factors influencing students’ college choice and persistence, and interviews to explore students’ experiences in more depth. Combining these methods allowed them to identify key factors while giving voice to students’ experiences. However, the researchers had to negotiate philosophical tensions between the two methods and balance qualitative and quantitative evidence in their analysis.

In the second study, the researchers combined survey and case study data to understand inclusive education practices. The survey results provided a broad perspective, while case studies offered an in-depth look at implementation in different schools. However, in this study, the qualitative data seemed to be secondary to the quantitative survey, limiting its influence on the findings. This imbalance highlights how the relationship between methods in mixed research can reflect deeper issues of power and whose knowledge counts.

In conclusion, while multi-strategy research has significant benefits in addressing complex social issues, researchers must thoughtfully navigate challenges related to expertise, methodology, and power. When done well, combining quantitative and qualitative methods can produce more compelling findings. But when done poorly, multi-strategy research risks prioritizing certain forms of knowledge and marginalizing others. With careful planning and sensitivity to power dynamics, researchers can leverage the strengths of mixed methods while avoiding these pitfalls. Overall, multi-strategy research is a promising but demanding approach for rigorous and inclusive social research.
