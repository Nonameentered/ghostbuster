The American classicist Moses Finley was one of the most prominent scholars of ancient Greece in the 20th century. He made significant contributions to Homeric studies and interpretations of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey. Finley analyzed these foundational texts of Western literature from an anthropological and social-historical perspective. He moved away from the philological and literary-critical approaches that had dominated classical scholarship. Instead, he sought to understand the culture, social norms, and daily life that are reflected in and shaped Homer's epics. 

Finley's most important contribution was his argument that the political and social structure portrayed in the Homeric epics reflected the historical conditions of the time in which they were composed, around the 8th century BC. The poems depict a world dominated by great aristocratic households and warrior leaders like Odysseus and Achilles. Finley contended that this accurately reflected the prevailing social structure during the "Dark Age" after the fall of the Mycenaean kingdoms. Contrary to earlier views, Finley maintained that the poems were not just fanciful literary creations but were intended as depictions of contemporary life and values that would resonate with audiences.

Finley also focused on illuminating key aspects of community and culture in the Homeric world. He analyzed the nature of gift exchange, the unwritten rules of hospitality and courtesy that bound the aristocrats together, and the importance of honor, glory, and reputation as moral imperatives. His interpretations shaped generations of scholars and remain deeply influential. They inspired more recent works like Ian Morris's "Archaeology as Cultural History."

However, Finley's approach and conclusions have also been subject to some critiques. His view of the poems as reflections of the "Dark Age" has been questioned, and many scholars now believe the epics reached their final form in the 8th century but drew on much older Mycenaean-era poetic traditions. His reconstructed vision of the social structure and values of the time period has also been challenged as too simplistic. 

More recent scholarship has found evidence that commerce, writing, and political institutions were more developed in Homer's era than Finley allowed. His theories tended to downplay the role of religion and focused almost exclusively on the aristocratic warrior culture. Some argue this resulted in an incomplete picture of society. There are also post-modern critiques of Finley's approach, claiming he imposed modern notions of culture, politics and economics on ancient Greece in an ahistorical fashion. 

In conclusion, Moses Finley was the pioneering figure who established Homeric scholarship as an anthropological and social-historical discipline. His interpretations of the epics as reflections of Greek society in the 8th century BC and his insights into aristocratic culture, ethics and community norms were highly consequential and remain influential today, though aspects have also been contested by later scholars. Through his multidisciplinary approach, provocative theories, and eloquent writing style, Finley's work on Homer stands as a monument in the study of the ancient world.
