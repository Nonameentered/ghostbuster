Organochlorine pesticides are synthetic chemicals that contain chlorine, carbon, and hydrogen. They were introduced starting in the 1940s and used widely from the 1950s through 1970s to control agricultural pests and improve crop yields. Pesticides like DDT and chlordane improved quality of life by reducing insect-borne diseases and increasing food production. However, organochlorines accumulate in the environment and the human body, and many were banned due to toxicity and links to health issues.  

Organophosphate pesticides were developed as alternatives to organochlorines. Unlike organochlorines which persist in the environment, organophosphates biodegrade more quickly. However, organophosphates are still highly toxic. They work by inhibiting cholinesterase, an enzyme essential for nerve signaling. This disrupts the nervous system of insects and other animals. The phosphate group in organophosphates allows them to bond strongly to cholinesterase. By binding to the enzyme, it blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, causing nervous system overstimulation.

Some early organophosphate pesticides were originally developed as nerve agents for warfare. These include tabun, sarin, and soman. They were used in combat during World War 1 and continue to be used in chemical warfare. Other organophosphates like malathion, parathion, and diazinon were developed and used primarily as pesticides in agriculture and home gardens. While highly effective, repeated use of these chemicals has led to environmental buildup and negative health impacts on farm workers, wildlife, and consumers.

With repeated applications over time, some organophosphates have become less biodegradable in the environment. Certain microbes in the soil have developed the ability to break them down, but at a slower rate. Some pesticides may also bind strongly to soil particles, rendering them unavailable to microbes for breakdown. Some breakdown products of organophosphates can also be toxic and persist. The result is gradual accumulation in the environment that may impact groundwater, wildlife, and human health.  

In summary, while organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides led to improved quality of life through increased food production and disease reduction, many were later banned or restricted due to toxicity and environmental impact. The risks associated with these chemicals have driven the development of alternative pest control methods to balance sustaining agriculture with mitigating harm to health and the environment.
