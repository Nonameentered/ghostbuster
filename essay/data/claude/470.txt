Evaluate Hobbes' justifications for political obligation, examining his contextual origins, theoretical nature, and inherent flaws and limitations.  

Thomas Hobbes, the 17th century English philosopher, proposed a social contract theory to justify political obligation â€“ the duty of citizens to obey their rulers and authority. Hobbes lived during a time of immense political turmoil in England, including a civil war and the overthrow of the monarchy. This context profoundly influenced his view that a strong, undivided sovereign power was necessary to ensure stability and prevent civil war. He articulated his social contract theory in his famous work Leviathan, published in 1651.

According to Hobbes, individuals in a state of nature, the hypothetical condition of humanity without a sovereign power, live in a state of constant fear and danger. There is competition over scarce resources and a lack of security or system of law. People are in a "war of all against all," making life "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." To overcome this violence and chaos, individuals agree to establish a social contract and form societies by collectively and voluntarily ceding their individual rights and powers to an absolute sovereign ruler. By consenting to be ruled by a sovereign, people can achieve peace and security. This is the foundation of political obligation and the legitimacy of sovereign rule, in Hobbes' view.

Hobbes' theory reflects his prioritization of stability and security above all else. He argues for an essentially unlimited sovereign ruler to avoid the perils of political disorder and instability he had witnessed. However, there are some major flaws and limitations in Hobbes' arguments. First, he relies on a implausible hypothetical state of nature and a social contract that likely never existed as he describes. His theory is more hypothetical than grounded in actual historical evidence. Second, Hobbes argues for an absolute sovereignty that denies citizens many basic rights and liberties that are now considered essential, like free speech, assembly, and political dissent. His theory prescribes an authoritarian ruler with powers that are easily abused. Lastly, Hobbes fails to adequately consider how citizens can ensure that the sovereign acts in their interests and protects their security, rather than exploiting them. If the sovereign breaks the social contract, Hobbes offers no recourse for citizens.

In conclusion, while Hobbes' theory of political obligation emerged from an understandable desire for stability in turbulent times, it relies on a questionable hypothetical contract and proposes an absolute rule that denies citizens their basic rights and liberties. His theory ultimately fails to reconcile the need for security with limits on sovereign power and protections for citizens. Hobbes makes a case for the necessity of government and rule of law, but takes it too far in prescribing unlimited power to a sovereign ruler. His theory has been highly influential but contains flaws that render it inadequate as a basis for justifying political obligation today.
