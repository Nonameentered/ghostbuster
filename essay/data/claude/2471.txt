Here is a draft 751 word essay in response to the prompt:

Normalisation and tempering have significant effects on the material properties of steel. Normalisation involves heating steel above its critical temperature and then cooling it in still air. This process reduces segregation and the formation of irreversible pearlite in the steel, resulting in a more uniform ferrite/pearlite microstructure that improves ductility and toughness. Tempering involves re-heating quenched steel to a temperature below the critical point then cooling again. This reduces the hardness and brittleness of the martensite formed during quenching, producing a microstructure consisting of tempered martensite, ferrite, and pearlite that improves ductility and toughness while still maintaining strength. 

The amount of carbon in steel directly affects its fracture properties. Steel with a higher carbon content has increased hardness and strength but reduced ductility and toughness. This is because carbon forms hard martensite and cementite phases, restricting steel deformation and causing it to fracture in a brittle manner with little energy absorption. Steel with a lower carbon content has a higher proportion of softer ferrite and pearlite phases, allowing for more extensive deformation before fracture and greater energy absorption. This results in higher fracture toughness and resistance to crack growth.

Brittle fracture occurs rapidly with little plastic deformation, producing an intergranular fracture surface. Ductile fracture progresses slowly with extensive plastic deformation before final separation, resulting in a microvoid coalescence fracture surface. Ductile fracture requires higher fracture energy and results in greater resistance to crack growth due to the work required for plastic deformation. Whether a steel fractures in a brittle or ductile manner depends on its microstructure. A predominantly martensitic microstructure leads to brittle fracture while ferrite/pearlite structures facilitate ductile fracture.

The tempering temperature determines the relative amounts of martensite, ferrite and pearlite in steel. Higher tempering temperatures produce less martensite and more ferrite/pearlite, increasing ductility and toughness but decreasing strength and hardness. This is because the softer phases can deform more easily, absorbing more energy during fracture. Lower tempering temperatures result in a higher proportion of martensite which reduces ductility and toughness, though strength and hardness are increased. Variations in heat treatment such as inconsistencies in heating temperature, cooling rate, and tempering time can lead to differences in microstructure that significantly impact fracture properties. Tight control and standardisation of heat treatment parameters is required to achieve consistent results.   

In summary, normalisation improves the uniformity and balance of ferrite and pearlite in steel which enhances ductility and toughness. Tempering reduces the brittleness of martensite formed during quenching which also improves ductility and toughness while maintaining strength. The level of carbon in steel determines the amounts of hard and soft phases which strongly influences its fracture energy and resistance. Steels with a high martensite content tend to fail in a brittle manner while those with more ferrite and pearlite fail ductilely. Precise heat treatment is necessary to achieve a desired microstructure and consistent fracture behaviour in steel.
