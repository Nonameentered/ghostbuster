Here is a draft essay in 1500 words on Wordsworth's view on childhood and death as portrayed in the poem "We are Seven":

William Wordsworth's poem "We are Seven" offers a glimpse into his view on childhood and death through the perspective of a young girl. The poem depicts a conversation between the speaker, an adult male, and an eight-year-old girl about her family. When the speaker tries to convince the girl that she has only five siblings because two have died, she insists "we are seven" through her innocent but stubborn logic. 

Wordsworth uses the exchange between the speaker and the young girl to highlight the differences in how children and adults perceive death. To the girl, the spirits of her deceased siblings remain an integral part of her family. She says, "Their graves are green, they may be seen...And often after sunset, sir, When it is light and fair, I take my little porringer And eat my supper there." The girl's personification of her siblings' graves as still being part of the family and community reveals her view of death as a temporary absence. She believes her brothers' spirits continue to dwell by their graves, indicating the afterlife is simply another form of being.

In contrast, the speaker seeks to impose his adult understanding of death as a permanent end upon the girl. He first tells her "you say you know of only four"--your two brothers who live with your mother, another brother "who is dead", and you. When she insists again "we are seven", the speaker argues "their spirits are in heaven!". His view reflects a Christian concept of the afterlife where the soul ascends to heaven, separated from the physical world. However, the girl refuses to accept this explanation, showing how a child's imagination allows them to blur the line between the physical and spiritual.

Wordsworth's use of lyrical and flowing language to depict the girl's speech emphasizes her purity and innocence. When describing her dead brothers, she says "Their graves are green, they may be seen"...And often after sunset, sir, When it is light and fair, I take my little   porringer  And eat my supper there." The rhythmic quality of these lines mirrors the cadence of a child's nursery rhyme, highlighting the girl's youthful simplicity. In contrast, the speaker's speech is more rigid, reflecting his more logical adult mindset. His unsuccessful attempts to convince the girl to share his perspective on death show how the purity and imagination of children enable them to see the spiritual in the physical world.

In the end, Wordsworth suggests the girl's view represents an ideal and almost magical way of perceiving the world. Her stubborn yet fanciful logic allows her to maintain a connection between the living and the dead. The poem reveals Wordsworth's view that children have an innate spirituality which adults often lose, highlighting a child's ability to see the supernatural in the natural world. Overall, "We are Seven" offers a glimpse into Wordsworth's view on life, death, and a child's imaginative mind.
