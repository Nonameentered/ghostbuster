Here is a draft 750-word essay in response to the prompt:

The regression model that was formulated to determine the variables affecting exam performance in the Quantitative Techniques module was a multiple linear regression model. The initial variables considered for inclusion in the model were: number of lecture attendances, number of tutorial attendances, number of assignments submitted, overall assignment mark, and number of hours studied.

Following analysis of correlations between these variables and the exam mark, as well as consideration of theoretical relevance of the variables, the variables included in the final regression model were: number of lecture attendances, number of tutorial attendances, and overall assignment mark. These three variables were found to have the strongest and most significant correlations with the exam mark. Inclusion of these three independent variables resulted in an R-squared value of 0.472, indicating that nearly half of the variation in exam performance could be explained by the model.

The variables number of assignments submitted and number of hours studied were excluded from the final model. Number of assignments submitted was found to have a weak correlation with exam mark and was not statistically significant. Number of hours studied was also not statistically significant, likely due to difficulty in accurately quantifying study hours. Furthermore, inclusion of this variable did not substantially improve the R-squared value.

A quadratic functional form was determined to be the optimal form for modeling the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable, exam mark. Specifically, the relationship between number of lecture attendances and exam mark was found to be quadratic. While initially exam mark increased with higher attendances, the rate of increase slowed and eventually started to decrease at very high attendance levels, giving the quadratic shape. The relationships between number of tutorial attendances and overall assignment mark with the exam mark were found to be approximately linear.

In summary, the multiple linear regression model with a quadratic function for lecture attendances was selected as the optimal model for predicting exam performance. The model included the significant variables of lecture attendances, tutorial attendances, and assignment mark, and explained 47.2% of the variation in first year Quantitative Techniques exam marks.
