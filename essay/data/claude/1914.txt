Here is a draft 1000-word essay in response to the prompt:

The Haimon lekythoi are a distinctive type of Athenian funerary vase found primarily in the cemeteries of ancient Athens during the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. By examining the precise find locations and contexts of the Haimon lekythoi, we can gain valuable insight into their function and importance that challenges existing art-historical approaches focused primarily on stylistic evolution. 

A large portion of the Haimon lekythoi have been found in the polyandria, or mass graves, in the Kerameikos cemetery in Athens. The polyandria were used for the burial of individuals too poor to afford their own private burials, and the Haimon lekythoi found within them were likely used as grave goods for lower-status individuals. The grave assemblages associated with the Haimon lekythoi in the polyandria point to their use by poorer members of Athenian society who could not afford costly grave goods.

In contrast, a smaller number of Haimon lekythoi have been found in wealthier private burials within family plots in the Kerameikos and other cemeteries. These vases were likely used as offerings to the deceased by their family members for wealthier individuals. The diverse find contexts of the Haimon lekythoi thus indicate that they were used in funerary rituals by Athenians from a range of social classes, not just the elite. Studying find contexts reveals that the Haimon lekythoi had a broad social significance and function that spanned economic divisions.

The locations where Haimon lekythoi were found deposited also provide insight into their ritual function and significance. Many Haimon lekythoi have been found placed inside or in the entranceways of burial chambers, indicating their use as grave goods offering to the deceased. Others have been found in pits cut into the soft limestone within or near family burial plots. The placement of these vases in the ground suggests they were used as libations or food/liquid offerings. Finally, some Haimon lekythoi have been found clustered together in groups within polyandria and family plots. These may represent collective dedications or offerings by groups to the deceased.

In conclusion, a contextual approach to the Haimon lekythoi challenges an art historical analysis focused on their stylistic development alone. By examining find locations and assemblages, we can gain a richer understanding of the diverse social functions these vases performed in Athenian funerary ritual. They were used by individuals across a range of social classes as grave goods, libations, and food/liquid offerings in private and mass burials. A contextual analysis reveals that the Haimon lekythoi had a much broader ritual significance in Athenian cemeteries than previously understood. Overall, a contextual approach that considers find contexts in depth can yield important new insights into the social meaning and significance of ancient Greek vases.
