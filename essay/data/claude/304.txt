The Heckscher-Ohlin (H-O) model, developed by Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin, is a popular model of international trade that builds on David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage. The Ricardian model determines comparative advantage based on differences in labor productivity across countries, but assumes that labor is the only factor of production and that it is homogeneous. The H-O model relaxes these assumptions and incorporates differences in factor endowments of capital and labor between countries as the basis for comparative advantage and trade.  

The H-O model assumes that there are two countries, two factors of production (capital and labor), and two goods that differ in factor intensity. The amount of capital and labor in each country determines their factor endowments. Countries will have a comparative advantage in the good that makes intensive use of the factor with which it is relatively abundantly endowed. For example, a labor-abundant country will have a comparative advantage in producing labor-intensive goods, while a capital-abundant country will have a comparative advantage in capital-intensive goods. These differences in comparative advantage form the basis for mutually beneficial trade between the countries.

The H-O model relies on several key assumptions. First, goods can be classified as either labor-intensive or capital-intensive. Second, production technology is the same in both countries. Third, factors of production are immobile between countries. Fourth, there are constant returns to scale. Fifth, consumers have the same preferences across countries. Finally, factors are rewarded based on their marginal productivities.

An important implication of the H-O model is the Factor Price Equalization (FPE) theorem. The FPE theorem states that under free trade, the relative prices of factors will be equalized across countries. As countries specialize in their comparative advantage goods and trade, factors that are intensively used in exported goods will experience higher demand and factor payments. Factors that are intensively used in imported goods will experience lower demand and payments. This will continue until relative factor prices equalize across countries. The FPE ensures that world production is on the global production possibility frontier, achieving Pareto efficiency. 

However, the FPE theorem rests on the assumption of identical technology and factor intensity across countries. When this assumption fails due to Factor Intensity Reversals (FIRs), factor price equalization will not occur. For example, if a good switches from being capital-intensive in one country to labor-intensive in another country due to differences in technology, specializing and trading based on comparative advantage will no longer equalize factor prices. The country exporting the good will experience a greater increase in the payment to the factor used intensively in its production process. This can be illustrated using graphs of the factor price frontiers for the two countries.

In conclusion, the H-O model builds on Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage by incorporating differences in factor endowments to explain trade patterns between countries. Underlying assumptions include identical and constant technology, factor immobility, and product differentiation based on factor intensity. The FPE theorem shows how trade based on comparative advantage can achieve global efficiency, but FIRs demonstrate how differences in technology can cause the FPE to fail, resulting in unequal changes in factor payments between trading partners. The H-O model provides important insights into the role of factor endowments in determining trade flows and distributional effects.
