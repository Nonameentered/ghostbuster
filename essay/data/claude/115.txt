Here is a draft 500-word financial analysis report on Kidde plc:

Introduction

Kidde plc is a fire and safety manufacturing company headquartered in the United Kingdom. This report will analyze Kidde's financial performance and prospects in the 2003 financial year and provide a recommendation for shareholders. 

Profitability

Kidde's profitability declined in 2003, with operating profit decreasing 15% to £104 million from £122 million in 2002. Profit before tax fell 18% to £86 million. This was mainly due to an 8% decrease in revenue from £1,366 million to £1,257 million. The drop in sales and profits was largely caused by disruption from the integration of newly acquired businesses, adverse foreign exchange movements, and increased investment to improve efficiency. Profit margins also compressed due to higher costs. Although Kidde's profitability fell in 2003, its long-term prospects remain strong as it continues to integrate new acquisitions to drive future growth.

Liquidity

Kidde's liquidity position remains stable. Cash and bank deposits increased 4% to £114 million, compared to current liabilities of £375 million. The current ratio of 1.6 times indicates Kidde has sufficient liquid assets to meet its short-term obligations. Historically, Kidde has financed most of its acquisitions through operating cash flow and long-term debt, so its healthy liquidity profile and modest gearing ratio of 34% provides financial flexibility for future investments.  

Efficiency

Kidde's return on capital employed declined to 11.3% from 12.7% in 2002 due to lower operating profits. Its operating cash flow of £153 million, however, remained stable, highlighting its ability to generate cash despite weaker earnings. Kidde continues to implement initiatives to improve operational efficiencies through integration of its acquisitions. These efforts should help lower costs, increase productivity and boost return on capital in the long run.

Shareholder Returns

Despite the fall in earnings, Kidde maintained its dividend at 15.25 pence per share. The dividend cover fell to 1.9 times from 2.3 times, but is still at a sustainable level. Total shareholder return in 2003 was -6%, reflecting the drop in both capital gains and dividends. While the lower profits and returns in 2003 were disappointing, Kidde's strategy to drive growth through acquisitions and increase operational efficiency should benefit shareholders in the long run.

Recommendation

In view of Kidde's long-term growth strategy, stable financial position, and reasonable valuation, I would recommend shareholders to continue holding their investment in the company. The short-term decline in 2003 should reverse once Kidde fully realizes the benefits of its restructuring and acquisition activities. Kidde remains well-placed for future growth and shareholder value creation.
