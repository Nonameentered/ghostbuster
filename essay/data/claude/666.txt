Here is a draft 2500 word essay in response to the prompt:

A standing wave is a harmonic pattern of vibration that persists in a medium. It occurs when a traveling wave interacts with a boundary in the medium and interferes with itself, creating peaks and troughs of vibration that stand still. On a taut string, standing waves can be produced by vibrating the string at specific frequencies that match the harmonics of the string. 

To understand standing waves, it is helpful to first consider simple harmonic motion and traveling waves. In simple harmonic motion, an object vibrates around an equilibrium position at a specific frequency. The frequency depends on the stiffness of the restoring force acting on the object and the object's mass. For a string, the restoring force is the tension in the string, which acts to pull displaced parts of the string back to equilibrium. The mass is the linear mass density of the string.

When the string is vibrated at one of its harmonic frequencies, traveling waves form and propagate in opposite directions. At the fixed ends of the string, the waves reflect and travel back along the string. When the incident and reflected waves meet, they interfere. When the peaks of the waves align, they constructively interfere; when the peaks of one wave align with the troughs of the other, they destructively interfere. At certain points, marked by nodes, the waves cancel out. At other points, marked by antinodes, the waves reinforce each other. The result is a standing wave with fixed nodes and antinodes that persist in the string. 

The fundamental frequency of vibration for a string depends on its tension, mass, and length. Higher frequencies are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency and correspond to higher harmonics. For a given tension and mass, the wavelength of the fundamental standing wave will be twice the length of the string. The second harmonic will have a wavelength equal to the string length, and so on for higher harmonics. 

Frequency is inversely proportional to wavelength for a given velocity, so higher harmonics have higher frequencies and shorter wavelengths. The velocity of waves in a string depends on the square root of the tension over the linear mass density. So for a heavier string of the same length and tension, the velocity will be lower, decreasing the frequencies of the harmonics. Likewise, increasing tension or decreasing length will increase frequency for a given string.

For a thick string, the elastic force comes from molecular interactions within the string. The linear density is higher, so the wave velocity is lower. However, the tension force still depends on the cross-sectional area. So, the frequencies of higher harmonics are more widely spaced for a thick string. The larger frequency differences indicate the elastic force acts over shorter ranges within the thicker string. 

In summary, standing waves on strings arise from the interference of traveling waves at boundaries. The fundamental frequency and resulting harmonics depend on the properties of the string that govern its wave velocity and simple harmonic motion. Examining how the harmonics change with string parameters provides insight into the forces at work. Standing waves on strings provide a helpful illustration of how traveling and standing waves can form in various media.
