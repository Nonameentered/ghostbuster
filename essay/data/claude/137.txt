Multiple factors led to the divergence between the West (specifically Western Europe) and the East (focused on China) between 1300 and 1800. This essay will argue that while there were some connections formed during this time period that contributed to the divergence, much of it was due to luck and good fortune. The economies, state control, and religions of Europe, China, and the Ottoman Empire were quite similar for most of this time. However, the move towards modernity, symbolized by the Industrial Revolution and population growth in the West, ultimately led to the divergence between East and West. 

During the 14th through 16th centuries, Europe, China, and the Ottoman Empire had relatively similar economies based on agriculture and trade. Most people in all three regions lived in rural areas and worked as farmers or in agricultural production. There were also important trading networks like the Silk Road and maritime routes across the Indian Ocean that connected the regions. Major trading cities like Beijing, London, and Istanbul emerged as centers of commerce. So economically, the three regions were quite alike and interconnected through trade networks.

Politically, Europe, China, and the Ottoman Empire also had some similarities in state control and governance. All three regions were ruled by hereditary monarchies that claimed divine right to rule. The Chinese emperor, European kings, and Ottoman sultan held vast power over their subjects. They administered their states through bureaucracies, with civil service exams in China and the devshirme system in the Ottoman Empire. However, the Ottoman Empire and China were more centralized, while Europe had stronger independent nobility. So while there were some similarities, there were also differences in political governance.

Religiously, the three regions were quite distinct but still co-existed. China was predominantly influenced by Confucianism and Buddhism, Europe was Christian, and the Ottoman Empire was Muslim. But for most of this period, religion did not necessarily cause conflict between regions. For example, the Ottomans tolerated Christians, and European traders co-existed with various faiths along trade routes. So religious differences alone did not necessarily cause the later divergence.

Some global connections during this time contributed to convergence as well. For example, the trading networks like the Silk Road spread goods, knowledge, and technologies between regions. Crops from the Americas like potatoes and corn spread widely, which increased food supplies in China, Europe, and the Ottoman Empire. Knowledge of gunpowder and compass spread from East to West. These global flows of knowledge, culture, goods, and technologies led to cross-cultural exchanges that fostered convergence across regions.

However, the move towards modernity in Western Europe ultimately led to divergence from the East. The Scientific Revolution and Enlightenment in Europe promoted philosophy and science that challenged traditional knowledge. The Industrial Revolution began in England, resulting in mechanization, urbanization, and accelerated technological change that gave Europe a major economic advantage. Western Europe also experienced the fastest population growth, providing labor for industrialization. 

In contrast, China was slow to modernize its economy or political institutions. It held onto more traditional knowledge and ways of governing, and did not keep up with Western technological change or economic shifts. The Ottoman Empire began to weaken, clinging onto traditionalism while failing to modernize quickly enough. So while convergence occurred for centuries, ultimately the rapid move towards modernity in Western Europe caused a divergence from the traditional economies and societies of China and the Ottoman Empire.

In conclusion, while there were certainly global connections formed between 1300 and 1800 that spread knowledge and fostered cultural exchange between Europe, China, and the Ottoman Empire, much of the later divergence was due to luck and good fortune. Western Europeâ€™s favorable conditions, scientific advancements, and move into modernity with the Industrial Revolution ultimately caused it to diverge from the more traditional economies and political systems of China and the Ottoman Empire. Both connections and luck were at play in the emergence of differences between the West and the East.
