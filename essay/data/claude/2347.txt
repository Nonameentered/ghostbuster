Evaluating different brands of chocolate in terms of sensory attributes requires careful methodology and analysis to produce accurate and reliable results. In this essay, I will discuss the methods used to evaluate different chocolates, the results of such analyses, factors that can affect accuracy and reliability, and how these can be addressed.

A common method for evaluating chocolate through sensory analysis is known as descriptive sensory analysis. In this approach, a panel of trained assessors evaluate and quantify the intensities of attributes like sweetness, bitterness, cocoa flavor, nutty notes, and texture. The assessors rate each attribute on a scale, for example from 0 (not detectable) to 9 (extremely strong).  The ratings are then averaged across assessors to get a sensory profile for each product. This method was used by Afoakwa et al. (2008) to evaluate sensory qualities of dark chocolate made from cocoa beans from different countries of origin. They found chocolates made from cocoa beans from Ghana and Côte d’Ivoire to be more bitter and astringent but less cocoa-like than chocolates from Ecuador and Madagascar.

A potential issue with this method is assessor fatigue if many samples are evaluated in one sitting. Assessors can also be influenced by contrast effects between samples, where a very sweet or bitter sample can affect perception of subsequent samples. These factors can be addressed by limiting the number of samples in one session, randomizing the order of presentation, and including control samples at regular intervals. Providing breaks, using red lights which do not distort color perception, and ensuring all samples are at the same temperature also help accuracy. 

Another method is category scaling, where assessors group similar samples together in categories along one or more attributes, from least to most. This was used by Lim et al. (1993) to evaluate bitterness in commercial dark chocolates. They found a wide range of bitterness, with some chocolates placed in very bitter or quite bitter categories, while others were in intermediate or slightly bitter categories. A downside of category scaling is its lower sensitivity compared to quantitative methods. Presenting samples that span the range of bitterness, and training assessors on this attribute, can help address this limitation.

In summary, sensory analysis using trained panels and methods like descriptive analysis and category scaling can differentiate chocolates on attributes such as bitterness, cocoa flavor, and sweetness. Care must be taken to control factors like sample order and fatigue, provide calibration standards, adequate lighting, breaks, and temperature control. With appropriate methodology and analyst training, chocolate sensory analysis can reveal clear and meaningful differences between products in terms of sensory characteristics.
