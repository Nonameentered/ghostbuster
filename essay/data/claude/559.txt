Modern biochemistry laboratories utilize a variety of advanced techniques to analyze proteins and DNA. One such technique is mass spectrometry, which determines the mass of molecules by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of ionized molecules. The sample is first ionized into gaseous molecules, then accelerated by an electric field and deflected by a magnetic field based on their mass-to-charge ratio. Detectors measure the mass-to-charge ratios and determine the masses of the molecules. This technique is very precise and sensitive, allowing detection of small molecules.  

Another key technique is nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). NMR applies a strong magnetic field to align the nuclear spins of atoms in a molecule. Radio frequency pulses are then used to manipulate the spins. As the spins relax back to their equilibrium positions, they emit radio signals that provide information about the local chemical environment. By analyzing these signals, the structure of the molecule can be determined. NMR is a crucial tool for determining the three-dimensional shapes and conformations of proteins and nucleic acids.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is essential for amplifying and analyzing DNA. PCR uses repeated heating and cooling cycles to denature DNA into single strands, anneal complementary primers, and extend new strands from the primers using DNA polymerase enzymes. This results in exponential amplification of the target DNA region flanked by the primers. PCR has revolutionized DNA analysis by allowing amplification of DNA from miniscule samples. 

These are just a few of the techniques used in modern biochemistry labs. With various spectrometric, calorimetric, electrophoretic, and chromatographic methods, scientists now have an arsenal of tools to probe the basic properties of biological molecules and gain insights into their structures and functions. Advancements in biochemistry have been hugely enabled by the development of these technologies.
