Essay: The Investigation into Walden's Rule and Factors Influencing Salts' Conductivity

The conductivity of solutions containing both ionic species and non-electrolyte molecules has been a topic of scientific interest since the 19th century. One explanation for conductivity in such mixed solutions was hypothesized by Walden in 1900 and has come to be known as Walden's Rule. Walden proposed that conductivity in solutions with ionic salts and non-electrolyte molecules, such as the sugar sucrose, depended solely on the equivalent molar conductivity and the viscosity of the solution. Walden's Rule stated that equivalent conductivity (λ) multiplied by the viscosity (η) of the solution is a constant.

However, Walden's Rule was too simplistic of an explanation for the conductivity of mixed solutions. Subsequent investigations into solutions containing sucrose and ionic salts like sodium chloride or potassium chloride showed that conductivity depends on additional factors beyond simply viscosity and equivalent molar conductivity. Strength or molarity of the ionic species, temperature, and interactions between ions and non-electrolyte molecules have also been found to significantly influence conductivity.

One of the first investigations that disputed Walden's Rule studied solutions with varying concentrations of sucrose and sodium chloride. The study found that the equivalent conductivity and viscosity did not remain in a consistent ratio as the concentrations of sucrose and sodium chloride were increased. Instead, the conductivity rose more quickly than would be predicted by Walden's Rule. This indicates the strength or molarity of ions contributes to conductivity in a non-linear fashion, suggesting ion interactions and mobilities change with increasing concentration. 

Temperature also strongly influences conductivity in mixed solutions, as solubility, ion mobility, and interaction potentials are all temperature dependent. Multiple studies have shown conductivity increases with temperature even when viscosity decreases, which disputes Walden's premise that viscosity alone determines conductivity. Ion-ion interactions and ion clustering are more prominent at lower temperatures, restricting mobility. As temperature increases, these interactions weaken, and ions are more freely able to move in response to an electric field, leading to higher conductivity.

Finally, the interactions between ions and non-electrolyte molecules have been proven to impact conductivity. Sucrose in particular interacts with and can bind to some ions like sodium and chloride. At low and moderate concentrations of sucrose, these interactions hinder ion mobility, reducing conductivity below the levels predicted by equivalent molar conductivity and viscosity alone. However, at high sucrose concentrations, the ions become immobilized in sucrose binding sites, limiting interactions with other ions. This can lead to higher conductivity than intermediary sucrose concentrations, despite high viscosity.

In summary, Walden’s Rule that equivalent molar conductivity and viscosity solely determine solution conductivity was an oversimplification. Multiple factors beyond viscosity govern ion transport in mixed solutions, including ion concentration or molarity, temperature, and interactions between ions and non-electrolyte molecules. Sucrose-salt solutions in particular highlight the complexity of conductivity, as sucrose binding and unbinding of ions at different concentrations can variably impact ion mobility. While Walden’s Rule provided an initial framework for understanding conductivity in multi-component solutions, a far more comprehensive theory incorporating solution chemistry and ionics is required to explain conductivity behaviors across concentrations and conditions. The investigation into conductivity in sucrose and salt solutions has revealed a process that depends intimately on both molecular-level and system-level factors.
