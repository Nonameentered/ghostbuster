Natural Disasters That Can Damage Coral Reefs

Coral reefs around the world are under threat from a variety of natural disasters that can severely damage them. Some of the major disasters that negatively impact coral reefs include hurricanes, flooding, rising sea levels, and increased sea surface temperatures. These natural events can physically destroy coral reef structures, kill coral organisms, and disrupt the entire coral reef ecosystem.

One of the most destructive natural disasters for coral reefs are powerful hurricanes and typhoons. As these major storm systems move over coral reef areas, they can generate huge waves, strong currents, and high winds that physically break apart coral colonies and scatter debris across the reef. For example, in 1992 Hurricane Andrew damaged over 60% of coral reefs in the Florida Keys. The high winds can also churn up sediment from the sea floor and bring it to the surface, blocking sunlight from reaching the coral and smothering the reef.

Flooding and freshwater intrusion pose another threat to coral reefs. When heavy rains cause rivers and streams to overflow, the excess fresh water is flushed into the ocean, which can have damaging effects on coral reefs. Coral polyps need saltwater to survive, so too much fresh water can essentially poison them. Fresh water also carries higher levels of sediment, nutrients, and pollutants that end up settling onto coral reefs. For instance, severe flooding in Australia's Great Barrier Reef watershed has been linked to coral bleaching and higher mortality rates.

Rising sea levels, while a slow process, also present a major problem for the long term health of coral reefs. As sea levels increase due to climate change, coral reefs are inundated with deeper and warmer water. This results in coral bleaching and disease, and a loss of habitat for other reef creatures. Scientists predict that even moderate sea level rise will inundate many low-lying coral reef systems and small island nations by the end of the century. For example, it is estimated that 22 of the 29 coral atolls that make up the Chagos Archipelago would be submerged with 2 to 3 feet of sea level rise.
