Major urinary protein (MUP) is a liver-secreted protein that acts as a transport vehicle for pheromones and other chemical compounds in mouse urine. MUPs play an important role in mouse social and reproductive behaviors, with male mice using MUPs to communicate dominance and females using them to signal their reproductive state to males. 

The MUP protein has a barrel-shaped tertiary structure composed of 8 alpha helices that enclose a binding site cavity for ligands like pheromones. The binding site is made up of hydrophobic residues like leucine that can interact with the hydrocarbon portions of pheromone molecules. The inner diameter of the MUP barrel is approximately 7.5 angstroms, providing ample space to accommodate a variety of ligands. 

 Key to the MUP binding site are multiple salt bridges and hydrogen bonds between residues and the bound ligand. For example, bound 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (SBT) forms hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl group of Tyr123 as well as the backbone NH group of Leu17. SBT also forms CH-π interactions with the aromatic side chains of Phe36 and Tyr123, and its sulfur atom interacts with the positively charged guanidinium group of Arg120. These multiple points of contact help anchor SBT firmly inside the binding pocket.

The bond lengths between SBT and the surrounding residues are indicative of the stability of their interactions. The hydrogen bonds between SBT and Tyr123 measure 2.9 angstroms in length, close to the typical hydrogen bond length of 2.8 angstroms in proteins. The CH-π interactions also position the interacting groups at ideal distances, with the closest carbon on SBT measuring 3.7 angstroms from the ring centroid of Phe36. These distances suggest that SBT binds in an orientation optimized for tight interactions and stability within the MUP binding pocket.

An analysis of the MUP backbone torsion angles using the Ramachandran plot shows that most residues fall within the allowed and favored regions of the plot. Glycine residues, which are not constrained by the Ramachandran plot, show a wide range of phi and psi angles as expected. Two residues, Asp6 and Glu90, fall just outside the favored region in the left-handed alpha helical area of the Ramachandran plot.  The remaining residues that make up the alpha helices and loops of MUP mainly cluster around -50 to -70 degrees for phi and -50 to 0 degrees for psi, indicating their helical and extended natures. Overall, the Ramachandran plot analysis indicates that MUP has a well-ordered tertiary structure consistent with its function as a transport protein.

In summary, Major urinary protein acts as an essential courier for pheromones and ligands in mouse urine using a well-defined barrel structure. Key binding site residues form multiple interactions with ligands to hold them in an optimal orientation within the MUP pocket. An analysis of these interactions shows stable bond lengths and torsion angles that facilitate MUP’s role as a transporter of chemical signals. MUP serves as an elegant example of how protein structure enables function.
