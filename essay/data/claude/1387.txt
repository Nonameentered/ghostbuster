Is Ken Booth’s concept of 'utopian realism' a feasible IR concept? 

Ken Booth’s concept of 'utopian realism' aims to reconcile utopian ideals with realist pragmatism in international relations. Booth proposes four main propositions to achieve this: focusing on process rather than end-states; deriving 'minimalist utopias' from empirical observation of tendencies of peace and cooperation; harnessing 'process-utopias' to catalyze gradual change; and accepting 'reformist gradualism' in lieu of radical transformation. However, while innovative, 'utopian realism' faces significant obstacles that undermine its feasibility as an IR concept.

Booth's first proposition focuses on process over end-states, emphasizing human agency and inter-subjective meaning over static frameworks. This flexible approach is well-suited to the unpredictability of international politics. However, the open-ended nature of process also implies a lack of definitive vision or end-goal, making 'utopian realism' difficult to implement or measure. Without a clear utopian end-state, there are no yardsticks for progress or success. The feasibility of ‘utopian realism’ requires reconciling process with some broad vision of an improved world order.

The second proposition derives 'minimalist utopias' from tendencies of cooperation in global politics, on the logic that they represent latent potential. However, existing cooperation may simply reflect shared interests rather than utopian ideals. While Booth argues that even issue-specific cooperation contains emancipatory potential, there is little evidence that it can catalyze the paradigm change toward ‘utopian realism.’ Mere cooperation risks confusing means (working together) with ends (global justice and empowerment). The feasibility of ‘utopian realism’ requires anchoring ‘minimalist utopias’ in a normative theory of global justice and human emancipation. 

The third proposition utilizes Joseph Nye's ‘process-utopias’ to catalyze gradual change through discourse and policy reform. However, Nye himself argues that ‘process-utopias’ require leaders, ideas and events to steer change; they do not spontaneously generate transformation. Booth's faith in ‘process-utopias’ underestimates the obstacles posed by power politics and global inequalities that shape discourse and policy preferences. Process alone rarely counters dominant self-interests. The feasibility of ‘utopian realism’ necessitates a more proactive agenda to shape discourse and policy.

Finally, the proposition of ‘reformist gradualism’ accepts modest change over radical transformation. However, gradualist approaches often legitimize inequitable structures, and risk co-optation or tokenism. They fail to remedy root causes of global problems and injustices. While radical change is unrealistic, feasible vision must at least remedy systemic barriers to empowerment and justice. ‘Reformist gradualism’ alone is inadequate for ‘utopian realism.’

In conclusion, while Booth develops an innovative IR concept in ‘utopian realism,’ its feasibility is contingent on addressing significant limitations and obstacles. A feasible vision must anchor process in a normative end-goal; derive 'minimalist utopias' from ideals, not just cooperation; take a proactive stance to shape policy and discourse; and move beyond limited gradualism toward remedying systemic barriers. Alternatives like a Global Green New Deal provide a feasible vision for a just global transition within planetary boundaries. 'Utopian realism' remains an inspiring concept, but requires a more coherent vision and agenda to be viable in IR.
