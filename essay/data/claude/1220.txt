There are several benefits as well as challenges to integrating hedgerow management into dairy farm operations as part of an agri-environment scheme. Holly Green Farm, a 150-hectare dairy farm in the West Midlands of England, adopted hedgerow management as part of their agri-environment scheme and provides an informative case study for examining the pros and cons of this practice. 

One key benefit of hedgerow management for Holly Green Farm was increased feed efficiency. By planting hedgerow trees and shrubs that produce leaves, nuts, and berries that the dairy cows can eat, the farm was able to provide a supplemental food source for the cows during the grazing season at no additional cost. Studies show that allowing cows access to hedgerows can reduce winter feed costs by up to 20% due to the additional nutrition. At Holly Green Farm, the cows graze on hawthorn, blackthorn, rowan, and hazel from the hedgerows, which provide protein and nutrients. This has allowed the farm to increase milk yields without increasing the amount of feed.

However, hedgerow management also requires additional labour and costs. Pruning and coppicing the hedgerows takes time and resources. Holly Green Farm had to invest in equipment and machinery to maintain the hedgerows to meet the standards of their agri-environment scheme agreement. They also had to hire additional staff to oversee the hedgerow management, adding to labour costs. The benefits in feed efficiency have helped offset these costs over the long run but required an initial investment from the farm.

In terms of income generation, hedgerow management has opened up opportunities for Holly Green Farm through environmental stewardship grants and subsidies. By maintaining and enhancing over 10 kilometers of hedgerows on their farm as part of their agri-environment scheme, Holly Green Farm receives payments of over Â£5,000 per year. These payments provide an additional income source for the farm and incentive to continue effective hedgerow management. However, the subsidies are not guaranteed long-term, and if they were discontinued, the costs of hedgerow management may outweigh the benefits.

Regulations around hedgerow management also pose challenges. There are restrictions on when and how often hedgerows can be cut or coppiced to ensure they provide habitat and food sources for local wildlife. Holly Green Farm must follow regulations set by Natural England for their agri-environment scheme which limits their flexibility and control over hedgerow management. Restrictions on the use of machinery to cut hedgerows at certain times of year can also make the process more difficult and time-consuming.

In conclusion, while hedgerow management as part of an agri-environment scheme provides benefits to dairy farms such as Holly Green Farm, including increased feed efficiency and income opportunities, it also requires a significant investment of resources and brings additional regulations and labour costs. For Holly Green Farm, the benefits appear to outweigh the costs due to the contributions of hedgerows to animal nutrition and environmental stewardship payments. However, as subsidies face uncertainty, farms must evaluate the pros and cons based on their own unique circumstances. When implemented effectively, hedgerow management can be a sustainable and productive practice for both dairy operations and the environment.
