To become a professional engineer, more than just a degree is needed. Beyond the technical knowledge and skills acquired  through an engineering education, several qualities are critical to being a responsible and effective engineer.

First and foremost, strong communication skills are essential. Professional engineers need to be able to convey complex technical concepts and designs in a clear, concise manner to various stakeholders, whether they are coworkers, clients, or the general public. This includes the ability to listen well to understand problems and needs. Written, oral, and visual communication skills are all important.

Another key quality is interpersonal skills and the ability to work collaboratively. Engineers must interact with many other people and work as members of multidisciplinary teams. They need to be able to manage relationships and handle interpersonal dynamics in a professional manner. Strong teamwork and leadership skills are extremely useful. 

Creativity and problem-solving skills are necessary to be an effective engineer. Professional engineers are constantly confronting open-ended problems that require innovative solutions. The ability to think logically and analytically to understand problems and design solutions is crucial. Resourcefulness in finding solutions and optimizing designs is also important. 

Lifelong learning is an essential part of professional engineering. Technologies and standards are constantly changing, so professional engineers must keep their knowledge and skills up to date through continuous learning and development. They need to be willing and able to learn new concepts and tools to advance in their careers. 

A strong work ethic and integrity are also defining qualities of professionalism for engineers. Engineers are responsible for designs that impact public safety, health, and wellbeing. They need to hold themselves to high standards of ethics and quality in their work. Diligence, dependability, and accountability are qualities that mark a professional engineer.

In conclusion, having a degree is necessary but not sufficient to become a professional engineer. Strong soft skills like communication ability, interpersonal skills, problem solving, continuous learning, and a moral code of ethics are equally crucial. Acting with integrity and responsibility is at the core of professionalism for any engineer. Technical skills will take you far, but professional skills are what define an engineer.
