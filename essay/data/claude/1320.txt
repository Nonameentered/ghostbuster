Many argue that achieving full equality in society is still an elusive goal, despite the progress that has been made in reducing discrimination and providing equal opportunities and rights under the law. One area where inequality continues to persist is in the workplace, specifically in how women face discrimination, unequal pay, and barrier to career advancement relative to men. 

In the essay "The Gender Pay Gap is the Economy Road Block," author Maya Rockeymoore Cummings lays out the argument that the substantial wage gap between men and women in the U.S. amounts to systemic discrimination that harms women economically over the course of their lives and careers. She cites research showing that women earn about 80 cents for every dollar earned by men, amounting to a wage gap of 20 percent. Over the course of a 40-year career, the typical woman loses $400,000 relative to her male counterparts. And the gap is even larger for women of color.

Cummings argues that this wage gap amounts to discrimination, not simply a function of women's choices or job preferences. While factors like level of education, job selection, and hours worked do account for some portion of the gap, about 38 percent is still unexplained by anything other than gender alone according to studies. This unexplained portion amounts to pure discrimination. And the consequences are huge, amounting to thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost wages for women that seriously hinders their lifetime earning potential and economic security.

The wage gap also contributes to inequality in the workplace beyond just wages alone. The gap in pay often translates into gaps in other benefits like healthcare, retirement plans, and paid time off. It signals that women's work is less valuable, which in turn contributes to barriers to advancement for women, especially in higher-paying leadership and executive roles in companies. Closing the gender wage gap, Cummings argues, would provide substantial benefits not just for women but for the overall economy, as women would have greater financial freedom and security to spend and invest.

In summary, the central argument around equality for women in the workplace focuses on the sizable and consequential gap in pay and opportunity for women relative to men that amounts to systemic discrimination. Achieving true equality will require closing stubborn wage gaps, promoting fair policies around hiring, advancement, and benefits, and working to shift cultural attitudes about the value of women's labor and leadership. Progress on these fronts would provide substantial benefits not just for women themselves but for businesses and the broader economy. Workplace equality is still an elusive goal, but one very much worth continuing to pursue through advocacy, policy changes, voluntary corporate reforms, and education.
