The ancient Romans held complex and varied ideas about the progression of human life from childhood to adulthood to old age. These concepts of the human life cycle strongly influenced how Roman society viewed and treated people at different stages of life, especially as they transitioned to adulthood. 

For males in ancient Rome, a key transition point was reaching physical maturity and adulthood around age 18. At this point, a boy could vote, hold public office, and was liable for military service. However, full adulthood and independence was not reached until a man's mid-20s or later, once he had completed military service and ideally held public office. Marriage was also typically delayed until the late 20s. Physically mature but still dependent males in their late teens and early 20s occupied an ambiguous space between childhood and full adulthood. They were expected to demonstrate masculine virtues and start their political and military careers, but still lacked full independence and authority.

For females, the life cycle transition was more sharply defined around marriage and motherhood. Girls typically married in their mid-teens, marking their transition to adulthood, as defined by their new roles as wives and future mothers. Upon marriage, a bride left her childhood home and family and entered into the full authority of her husband. While females lacked political and military roles, a wife gained status and authority within the household based on her success as a mother, especially in bearing male heirs. 

These concepts of the life cycle and transitions to adulthood were closely tied to expectations regarding gender roles and responsibilities. For males, a key requirement was demonstrating military skill, physical strength, and traditional masculine virtues. For females, the primary responsibilities were as wives, homemakers, and mothers. Marriage and motherhood, not a particular age, marked a woman's transition to maturity and full adulthood.

In conclusion, the Romans held complex views on the progression of life from childhood to old age. Especially for the transition to adulthood, different ideas applied to males and females based on their distinct gender roles and responsibilities within Roman society regarding politics, military service, marriage, and family. These concepts of the human life cycle shaped how people of each gender and age were treated and the expectations placed upon them.
