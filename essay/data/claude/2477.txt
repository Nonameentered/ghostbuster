Prompt: Translate the following pseudo-code into a C program:

1. Read in two integer values x and y
2. If x is less than or equal to 10 and y is less than or equal to 10, return to Step 1. 
3. Otherwise, calculate z = x + y.
4. Display the value of z. 
5. Repeat Step 1.

C program:
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int x, y, z;
    
    printf("Enter two integer values: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
    
    while (x <= 10 && y <= 10) {
        printf("Enter two integer values: ");
        scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
    }
    
    z = x + y;
    printf("The sum is: %d\n", z);
    
    printf("Enter two integer values: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
}

To test the program:
Enter two integer values: 5 7 
The sum is: 12
Enter two integer values: 15 20  
The sum is: 35

One potential issue is that the program will continue prompting the user to enter integer values indefinitely. It may be better to have the user input a character to indicate they want to stop entering values, e.g.:

printf("Enter 'q' to quit, or two integer values: ");
scanf("%c %d %d", &c, &x, &y); 

if (c == 'q') {
    break; 
}

This allows the user to gracefully exit the program when they want to stop entering input values. Overall, this program implements the specified pseudo-code correctly in C and functions as intended.
