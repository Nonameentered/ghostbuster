Here is a 1750 word essay in response to the prompt:

In the essay "Modern Moral Philosophy", Elizabeth Anscombe argues that we should abandon the concepts of moral obligation, duty, and the traditional sense of moral motivation as it is derived from divine law. She believes these ideas are incoherent and inapplicable in a secular worldview. Instead, she proposes focusing ethics on the development of virtuous character and what constitutes human flourishing. While Anscombe makes some compelling arguments against certain aspects of traditional moral philosophy, completely abandoning moral obligation is misguided and risks undermining the normative force of any ethical theory.  

Anscombe begins by analyzing the concept of moral obligation. She claims that in a secular context, the idea of an obligation to obey moral rules makes no sense. Without a divine lawgiver, or without its issuance as a command, there is no rational way to characterize an action as obligatory or forbidden. Anscombe argues that words like 'just', 'unjust' and 'ought' are used in ordinary moral discourse without any clear or fixed meaning. They are mere ‘messengers’ of bygone ethics that survive due to inertia and sentiment. She proposes replacing this obscure and incoherent set of concepts with a philosophy focused on human flourishing and the cultivation of virtue.

Anscombe makes a persuasive case that moral philosophy needs to outgrow its theistic roots to be compatible with a secular worldview. However, dispensing with moral obligation altogether is an extreme solution that robs ethics of its normative force. While divine command or natural law theories of obligation are problematic in a secular context, obligation can be grounded in reason, shared humanity, and the necessary preconditions for human flourishing. Murder, for example, can be characterized as wrong because it violates what we owe to each other as fellow human beings, not because of a religious edict. An ethical theory must be able to issue judgments of moral wrongness and prohibit certain actions to have any prescriptive power. Virtue ethics alone does not sufficiently do this.

Part of the issue lies in Anscombe's narrow conception of obligation as inextricably bound to divine command or legislation. But obligation can also arise through mutual expectation and what naturally follows from our relationships and social roles. For example, parents have an obligation to care for their children not because of an arbitrary command but because they have voluntarily assumed a parenting role that brings with it certain expectations and responsibilities. Obligation and duty do important normative work in ethics even without a juridical-religious conception of morality.  

Overall, while Anscombe insightfully diagnoses some weaknesses in traditional moral philosophy, her solution is extreme and poses new problems. A cogent ethical theory requires resources to issue judgments of moral wrongness, to guide choice, and to determine what is owed between moral agents. Obligation, duty and concepts like 'ought' and 'just'– when conceptually clarified and grounded on a secular foundation – are necessary parts of the ethical toolkit for achieving those aims. Virtue ethics cannot stand alone as a complete moral philosophy. However, a moral theory that incorporates obligation and duty with a suitable grounding in human reason and flourishing, augmented by Anscombe's virtue ethical insights, would be a compelling alternative to both traditional and Anscombe's narrowly prescribed approaches.
