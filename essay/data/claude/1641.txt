The critical age hypothesis posits that there is a 'critical period' for language acquisition, after which it becomes very difficult, if not impossible, to reach a high level of proficiency in a second language (L2). According to this view, after puberty, neuroplastic changes in the brain make it difficult to acquire a native-like L2 accent and grammar. However, arguments against the critical age hypothesis demonstrate that age is not the only, or even the most important factor in successful L2 learning. Several other factors, such as motivation, learning environments, and teaching methods may have a greater influence on learners' outcomes.

One argument against the critical age hypothesis is that there is significant variation within age groups. Not all adults struggle with acquiring a L2, and some reach very high levels of proficiency. A study by Bongaerts et al. (1995) found several late learners of English whose performance on various linguistic measures was indistinguishable from that of native speakers. This demonstrates that adults can achieve nativelike proficiency, contradicting the predictions of the critical age hypothesis.  

Motivation and attitude are also more important for L2 learning than age. Learners who are highly motivated to integrate into the target language community and embrace the language are more likely to become highly proficient, regardless of their age of acquisition. Gardner and Lambert (1972) found that motivation for language learning depended on integrativeness, referring to a willingness to interact with and identify with members of the L2 community. Their findings show that motivation may have a greater influence on L2 proficiency than age alone.

The learning environment and teaching methodology also play an essential role in language acquisition. Learners who have opportunities to engage in meaningful interaction and communication in the L2, especially study abroad, tend to achieve higher proficiency and nativelike abilities. Immersion in the target language leads to better outcomes for L2 learners of all ages. In a review of study abroad research, Collentine (2009) found evidence that learners in their 20s and beyond made significant gains in L2 fluency and nativelikeness after a study abroad experience, contradicting the critical age hypothesis.  

In conclusion, researchers and foreign language teachers should be aware of the significant limitations of the critical age hypothesis...
