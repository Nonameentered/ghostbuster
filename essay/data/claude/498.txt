Here is a draft essay in roughly 1500 words on the prompt:

Institutions play a crucial role in facilitating economic growth and development. Well-developed institutions provide incentives for individuals and firms to invest, innovate, and engage in mutually beneficial exchange. Historically, the rise of certain institutions has enabled economic prosperity, while the lack or underdevelopment of key institutions has hindered growth and perpetuated poverty. 

One of the most fundamental institutions for growth is a system of secure property rights and contract enforcement. When individuals and businesses have secure ownership and control over assets and the fruits of their labor, they have strong incentives to work, invest, and take risks to improve their economic conditions. Similarly, when contracts are reliably enforced, firms and individuals can engage in complex exchanges, trade, and partnerships with reasonable certainty that agreements will be honored. These institutions were critical to enabling long-distance trade and commerce in early modern Europe, where rulers established basic protections for property and contracts. In contrast, many pre-colonial societies lacked strong protections, limiting trade and specialization.

Effective governance and administration also facilitate growth by providing public goods, enforcing laws, and implementing sound economic policies. European states built bureaucracies to provide services and security for commerce. They gathered revenue through reasonably fair and efficient tax systems, enabling spending on infrastructure to facilitate trade. In contrast, many pre-modern states were either too weak to provide basic governance or were predatory, offering little benefit to citizens and commerce. Corruption and rent-seeking by public officials can also severely hamper growth under any system of government.

Beyond secure property rights and governance, a variety of institutions shape incentives in an economy. Access to finance through institutions like banks and liquid markets enables new ventures and investment. An educated populace, fostered by public education, is better able to build on past knowledge. Trade policies like low tariffs can boost competition and trade, while overly protectionist policies do the opposite. And cultural institutions regarding work, trade, business, and risk shape entrepreneurship and commercial activity.

In summary, institutions provide the incentive structures, security, infrastructure, human and physical capital, and policy frameworks that enable growth. Where robust market-supporting institutions have developed, economic growth has flourished. Unfortunately, many nations remain stuck in a "poverty trap" with institutional failures perpetuating underdevelopment and limiting the benefits of globalization. Establishing pro-growth institutions remains one of the most promising paths for improving economic conditions worldwide.
