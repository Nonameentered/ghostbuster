Here is a draft 1500 word essay responding to the prompt on describing the concept, main features and objectives of the board game:

The board game described in the prompt appears to be a complex strategy game that requires players to build an civilization by gathering and managing resources, expanding territory, building infrastructure, and defending against opponents. The overarching concept behind the game seems to revolve around simulating the rise of an empire from its earliest beginnings to becoming a world power.

In terms of main features, the game board represents a map of the world divided into territories and regions that can be claimed and controlled by players. Players have a home territory to start from which they must build up by acquiring resources like wood, stone, wheat, and ore. These resources are collected through a roll of the dice and players can build settlements, cities and roads to gain access to more resources and claim more land. Players can also build armies to both defend their territories and attack opponents. An additional feature are development cards that can be purchased with resources and provide benefits like gaining armies, building free roads, earning resources or sabotaging opponents.

The core objectives for players appear to be to gain control of as much territory as possible through building settlements and claiming land, accumulate wealth by acquiring many resources and developing infrastructure, build defensive forces to protect lands from invasion, and adapt strategies to counter opponents and stay ahead in the game. The player who can best manage their resources, build armies, develop infrastructure, gain territory and defend their lands will ultimately emerge as the winner. Additional objectives involve strategizing to block other players from being able to access resources or land and forcing opponents to lose resources by attacking their settlements. All of these objectives must be balanced with building one's own civilization.

In summary, the board game seems to center around building and managing an empire with the goal of becoming the dominant power. By acquiring resources, claiming territories, developing infrastructure and building armies, players can gain power and accomplish the objectives of expansion, accumulation of wealth and defense of lands. However, to win the game, players must use strategy to gain advantages over opponents and hinder their progress. The player who accomplishes all these objectives and overcomes their opponents will ultimately emerge as the winner of this complex strategy board game.
