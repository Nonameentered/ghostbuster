Several factors affect seed quality during storage, including temperature, relative humidity, oxygen levels, and presence of pathogens. High temperature accelerates the deterioration of seeds through increased respiration, oxidation of storage compounds, and microbial growth. As temperature increases by 10°C, the storage life of seeds can be halved. Relative humidity also greatly impacts seed quality in storage. High humidity leads to increased seed moisture content, which speeds up respiration, microbial proliferation, and oxidation reactions that damage lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids.  

Oxygen availability similarly influences how quickly seeds lose viability in storage. When oxygen levels are high, oxidative reactions proceed rapidly, damaging cell components and storage reserves. The presence of pathogens such as fungi and bacteria can directly infect seeds, releasing toxins that kill the embryo or compete for storage reserves. These biotic agents thrive under warm, humid conditions, so proper drying and cooling of seeds before storage is critical to limiting pathogen growth.

Current methods for testing seed quality, such as the germination test and measures of seedling vigor, have some limitations. The germination test only indicates if a seed is alive, not how long it will remain viable after sowing or its growth potential. Vigor tests, like accelerated aging and electrical conductivity, aim to predict seed storability and performance but can be poorly correlated to field results. Biochemical tests measuring respiration, enzyme activity or nucleic acid integrity may provide an early indication of quality loss but ideally require costly, specialized equipment. Direct tests of seed content, like lipid peroxidation tests, can be time-consuming and limited to certain types of seeds. 

Advances in genomics and high-throughput phenotyping tools may help address some of these limitations. For example, DNA microarrays and RNA sequencing can detect patterns of gene expression that are indicative of aging or damage during storage before major viability losses occur. Image analysis of seedlings and computer modeling have potential to provide more accurate predictions of performance based on seedling traits. These approaches also allow evaluation at the single seed level, giving a more precise measure of lot quality.

The storage environment has a decisive impact on how quickly seeds lose quality over time. Low temperature, low humidity, and low oxygen are the optimal conditions for prolonging seed longevity in storage by slowing biological and chemical deterioration processes. For most species, each 1% decrease in moisture content or 10°C drop in temperature will double the potential life of the seeds. Modified atmosphere or hermetic storage at very low oxygen levels can significantly extend the shelf life of seeds compared to ambient conditions. Strict control of the storage environment is therefore essential for effective long-term seed preservation and to minimize loss of viability and vigor during carry-over storage between harvest and sowing. With vigilant and appropriate storage management, seed viability and performance can be maintained for many years.
