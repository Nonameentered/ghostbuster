English Nature is a statutory conservation body that was established by the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 and exists to ensure that England's wildlife, geology, and landscapes are protected, enhanced, and properly managed. As an executive non-departmental public body, English Nature advises the UK government on nature conservation issues and supports public understanding of the natural environment.  

English Nature has a variety of roles focused on nature conservation. First, it designates and protects Sites of Special Scientific Interest, which contain rare species of plants, animals or unusual geological features. There are currently over 4,000 SSSIs in England protecting around 7% of the country's land area. Second, English Nature works with private landowners and other organizations to establish nature reserves and protect important habitats. It provides grants and support for land management and habitat restoration. Third, English Nature has an advisory role and provides scientific evidence and guidance to inform policymaking and planning decisions by the government and local authorities. 

Rural Environmental Scientists can support English Nature's work in several ways. They can help survey land and assess sites to determine which areas should be designated as SSSIs or nature reserves based on ecological value. They can provide scientific expertise and research to support English Nature's advisory role. For example, they may study the impacts of land use change, pollution, or climate change on priority habitats and species. Their research can help inform policy decisions. Environmental Scientists can also help develop and implement management plans for protected sites and nature reserves to enhance biodiversity. This may involve activities like controlling invasive species, coppicing woodlands, or restoring heathlands. 

In summary, English Nature plays a crucial role in promoting nature conservation in England. Rural Environmental Scientists can support their work through ecological surveying, research and monitoring, and developing and implementing management plans for protected sites and nature reserves. By working together, English Nature and Environmental Scientists can help protect England's natural heritage for future generations.
