Having a view of social reality is crucial in sociology as it shapes how sociologists study and understand society. There are two dominant and opposing ontological premises in sociology - Individualism and Collectivism. Individualism sees society as the aggregation of individual actions and interactions. It focuses on individuals as the primary unit of analysis to explain social phenomena. Collectivism, on the other hand, views society as greater than the sum of its individual parts. It sees individuals as shaped by social collectives such as social structures and cultures. 

Both perspectives have significant limitations. Individualism downplays the influence of social collectives on individuals and struggles to explain large-scale social patterns and changes. It risks conceptualizing individuals as abstract and ahistorical. Collectivism, conversely, risks undermining human agency and heterogeneity by overemphasizing social structures. It struggles to account for social change as it sees individuals as overly determined by their social environment.

Realism provides a more comprehensive perspective as it aims to reconcile Individualism and Collectivism. Realists argue that social reality consists of the interplay between human agency and social structures. They see structures as real, external and constraining but also enable human action. At the same time, structures are continuously reproduced and transformed by the aggregate consequences of human actions. This dualist and relational ontology allows Realism to overcome the limitations of Individualism and Collectivism.

The debate between Ralph Miliband and Nicos Poulantzas exemplifies the differences between Individualism, Collectivism and Realism. Miliband adopts an Individualist approach in seeing the State as dominated by the interests of the social class in control of the means of production. He focuses on the individual interests and motives of members in the dominant class. Poulantzas takes a more Collectivist view in conceptualizing the State as a structure with a logic of its own that shapes the interests and actions of members of the dominant class. Realists argue that both human agency and structural dynamics shape the nature of the State. Class interests matter but they operate within and are influenced by the institutional logic of the State as a structure.

Compare this to Structuration Theory and Realism. Structuration Theory aims to provide a middle ground by recognizing a duality of agency and structure where the two constitute one another. However, Realists argue that this conceptualization risks conflating the two as a single, fused entity. Realism insists on the real distinction between human agents with subjective interests on one hand, and social structures as external, constraining and enabling conditions of action on the other. At the same time, Realism recognises that agency and structure reciprocally interact and shape one another through the process of structural elaboration and reproduction.

In conclusion, having a comprehensive social ontology is crucial for sociological analysis. Realism provides a dualist yet relational view of social reality that reconciles the divide between Individualism and Collectivism. By recognising the interplay between human agency and social structures, Realism offers a more coherent and compelling account of the complexity that constitutes the social world. Overall, Realism allows for a deeper and more rigorous analysis of society that neither underplays human subjectivity nor overestimates social causality.
