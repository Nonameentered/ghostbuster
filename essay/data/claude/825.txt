There are several clinical criteria that can be used to differentiate between benign and malignant skin lesions. Benign lesions such as moles typically have smooth, regular borders and even coloration. They grow slowly and are often symmetrical in shape. Malignant lesions such as melanoma often have irregular, jagged borders and uneven coloration, including multiple shades of brown, black, red, white, and blue. They grow rapidly in size. Other warning signs of melanoma include lesions that are asymmetric, have a diameter larger than 6 millimeters, or that bleed or itch. 

Certain factors can increase the risk of developing malignant skin lesions and melanoma. Excessive sun exposure, especially sunburns early in life, is a major risk factor. Tanning bed use also increases risk. People with many moles or dysplastic nevi are at higher risk, as are those with a family history of melanoma. Fair skin types that burn easily are more prone to melanoma. Immunosuppression such as with certain medications or HIV/AIDS also increases susceptibility.

The Glasgow 7-point checklist is a tool used by dermatologists to assess suspicious skin lesions. It evaluates lesions based on the warning signs of melanoma: change in size, irregular shape, irregular color, diameter larger than 7 millimeters, inflammation, oozing, and change over weeks or months. A higher score indicates higher risk, and histological analysis via skin biopsy may be needed to determine if the lesion is malignant or benign. 

Histological analysis examines the biopsy sample under a microscope to assess features like lesion symmetry, border irregularity, degree of cellular atypia, and depth of infiltration. These factors help determine prognosis and predict survival rates. Melanomas caught at an early stage before deep tissue invasion have a much higher survival rate. Both medical personnel and government health agencies play a key role in reducing late-stage diagnoses through public education on melanoma risks and warning signs, and by recommending regular self-exams and screening.

The symptoms of bladder cancer include blood in the urine, frequent or painful urination, back pain, and unexplained weight loss. Bladder tumors are often detected via cystoscopy, imaging tests, and urine cytology. Early diagnosis of bladder cancer leads to better treatment outcomes with surgical removal of tumors, chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy. Family support also improves quality of life and survival for those with bladder cancer through assistance with treatment, side effect management, and promoting healthy lifestyle changes. In summary, knowledge of risk factors and warning signs, early detection, and family support are key to better outcomes for those with melanoma and bladder cancer.
