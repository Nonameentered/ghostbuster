Measuring the elastic properties of materials, namely the Young's modulus and shear modulus, provides critical information about their mechanical behavior. For isotropic materials, which have the same properties in all directions, resonant vibration techniques have been commonly used to determine these moduli. In particular, vibrating cylindrical rods of the material have been employed to calculate the Young's modulus (E) and shear modulus (G) based on the resonance frequencies.  

When a cylindrical rod is subjected to vibration, it will resonate at certain frequencies that depend on its material properties, dimensions, and boundary conditions. For rods with free ends, the resonance frequencies can be measured and used to determine E and G. The lowest, or fundamental, resonance frequency (f1) depends on the Young's modulus, density (ρ), and dimensions (length (l) and diameter (d)) according to the equation:

f1 = 0.5E/(ρl2)

By measuring f1, l, d, and knowing ρ, E can be calculated. The higher resonance frequencies (e.g. f2, f3) depend on both E and G and more complex equations relate them. By measuring multiple resonance frequencies and solving the equations simultaneously, both E and G can be determined.

The specific methods for measuring the resonance frequencies of vibrating rods include:

1. Impulse excitation. An impulse, such as an impact from a hammer, is applied to excite the rod vibration. The resonance frequencies are determined using a microphone to measure the sound emitted from the rod. This technique is simple but can be inaccurate, especially at higher frequencies. 

2. Forced vibration. The rod is excited using an oscillator or shaker to vibrate at a range of frequencies. A vibration pickup measures the amplitude of vibration, and resonance peaks are detected at the resonance frequencies. This method allows for more accurate detection of higher resonance modes but requires more complex equipment.

3. Free decay. The rod is displaced from its equilibrium position and released so it vibrates freely. The vibration is measured using a non-contacting sensor, and the resonance frequencies are determined from the frequency spectrum of the signal. This approach avoids the excitation equipment needed for the forced vibration method but still achieves good accuracy.

In summary, the resonance frequencies of vibrating cylindrical rods have been used to determine the elastic moduli, E and G, of isotropic materials. By measuring multiple resonance frequencies and solving the governing equations, both E and G can be calculated from a single sample. A variety of vibration techniques have been employed to measure the resonance frequencies with good precision while using relatively simple equipment and procedures.
