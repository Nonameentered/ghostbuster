Here is a draft essay in approximately 1500 words:

The liar paradox, in its Eubulides version, states: "This statement is false." This sentence appears to contradict itself, as if it is true then it must be false, and if it is false then it must be true. Self-reference, where a proposition refers to itself, is a feature of this paradox but is not sufficient to create a paradox by itself. For a paradox to emerge, the self-reference must lead to a contradiction. 

Time is an important concept in understanding the liar paradox. At any single point in time, the sentence cannot be both true and false. However, when we reason about the sentence, we run into a contradiction because we implicitly consider what the sentence means at different points in time. If we say the sentence is true "now", then in the "next" moment we say it must be false, and vice versa, repeating endlessly. But time itself is continuous, not made up of discrete moments - we only percieve it that way. A solution to the paradox must address its temporal element.

One solution is dialetheism, the view that some sentences can be both true and false. We can then say the liar sentence is a "true contradiction" - both true and false simultaneously. This solution rejects the assumption that a sentence cannot be both true and false at the same time. However, dialetheism leads to challenges around how we can reason logically with contradictions.

A second solution is fuzzy logic, where sentences can have degrees of truth between "completely true" and "completely false". The liar sentence may be neither completely true nor completely false but have intermediate fuzzy truth values like 0.5. However, assigning a precise fuzzy truth value also appears contradictory, and fuzzy logic faces issues of ambiguity. 

In conclusion, the Eubulides version of the liar paradox highlights how self-reference in a proposition is not sufficient for it to be paradoxical. Temporal concepts are required to generate the contradiction, as we reason about what the sentence means at different points in time. Two solutions exist - dialetheism which accepts the contradiction, and fuzzy logic which gives intermediate degrees of truth. However, both solutions face further philosophical issues, and the liar paradox remains problematic. Overall, this paradox reveals deep questions about logic, semantics and the nature of truth itself.
