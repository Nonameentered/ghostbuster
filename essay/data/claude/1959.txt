There are several theories that attempt to explain the biological process of ageing and senescence. One of the earliest theories was the wear and tear theory, which suggested that the human body simply deteriorates over time due to accumulated damage and stress. However, this theory fails to explain why different species and organisms age at different rates. 

A more compelling theory is the cellular or genetic theory of ageing. This theory proposes that ageing results from the cumulative effects of cell aging. As cells age and divide over time, they accumulate cellular damage and mutations in their DNA. This damage builds up in cells and tissues over time, causing them to function less efficiently. An example is the shortening of telomeres, the caps at the end of chromosomes, with each cell division. When telomeres get too short, cells stop dividing and ageing accelerates. Genetic mutations and epigenetic changes also accumulate over time, compromising cell function.

Free radical damage is another significant contributor to the ageing process according to another theory. Free radicals are unstable molecules with unpaired electrons that damage cellular components like proteins, lipids, and DNA over time through oxidation. The free radical theory of ageing suggests that this progressive cell damage ultimately leads to ageing and age-related diseases. Antioxidants help combat free radical damage by neutralizing the unpaired electrons and preventing oxidation. Common antioxidants include vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, and flavonoids. By scavenging free radicals, antioxidants are believed to slow down ageing and reduce the risk of diseases like cancer and heart disease.

While each theory may help explain certain aspects of ageing, ageing is an enormously complex process that likely involves all these mechanisms and more. Genetics, cellular damage, free radicals, and other factors interact in complex ways to influence how we age. A balanced diet, exercise, limiting stress, and avoiding unhealthy habits can help promote longevity, but ageing remains an inevitable part of life for now. Overall, a combination of the genetic theory of ageing and the free radical theory provides a useful framework for understanding senescence and how we might intervene to age more healthily, but much remains to be understood about this mysterious process.
