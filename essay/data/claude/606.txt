Here is a draft 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) is a groundbreaking technique developed in the 1980s that allows scientists to visualize individual atoms on a surface. It works by scanning an electrically charged probe over the surface of a sample. As the probe approaches the surface, electrons can jump between the probe tip and the surfaceâ€”this is known as quantum tunnelling. By measuring the current flowing between the probe and the sample, scientists can map the electron density of the surface with atomic precision. 

STM was a revolutionary breakthrough because it allowed surface analysis at the atomic scale for the first time. Previous techniques such as electron microscopy could achieve high magnification but not atomic resolution. STM achieves much higher resolution by positioning the probe tip just a few angstroms from the sample surface, where the probability of quantum tunnelling of electrons is highest. This close proximity, combined with the ability to precisely control the position of the probe tip, gives STM unparalleled resolution.

STM has enabled groundbreaking discoveries in surface science, condensed matter physics, nanoscience, and other fields. For example, it allowed scientists to directly observe the hexagonal lattice of carbon atoms in graphene for the first time. It has been used to manipulate the position of individual atoms on surfaces. It has led to discoveries of new nanoscale structures like buckyballs. STM has even allowed scientists to directly observe chemical bonds between atoms. These are just a few examples of how STM has revolutionized our understanding of surfaces at the atomic scale.

However, STM also faces significant challenges. It requires an ultra-high vacuum environment and cryogenic cooling to achieve atomic resolution. It can only be used for imaging conductive or semiconductive samples. Probes are difficult and expensive to manufacture, and they degrade over time. Interpreting STM images requires sophisticated analysis to understand the complex interactions between the probe, the sample, and the environment. Despite these challenges, STM remains the premier technique for surface analysis at the atomic scale thanks to its unparalleled resolution and the insights it has yielded.

In summary, STM achieves atomic-scale resolution by scanning an electrically charged probe over a surface to map the quantum tunnelling of electrons. It has enabled groundbreaking discoveries in nanoscience and other fields of physics. Although it faces substantial technical challenges, STM remains the most powerful tool for visualizing surfaces at the level of individual atoms.
