Archaeologists use a variety of sources of evidence, including historical records and physical remains found at excavation sites, to identify the functions of Roman towns. Roman towns shared some common features, including a central administrative center, locations for public entertainment, religious worship sites, areas for private housing, and sites of trade. However, interpreting the specific function of any given location can be challenging given the limited evidence available.  

Roman towns typically had a central administrative center, located in the forum. The forum consisted of public buildings like the basilica, which housed legal and commercial activities, and the curia, where the town council met. Statues, monuments, and markets were also located in the forum. While the specific layout and scale of forums varied across towns, their role as a center of administration and public life was consistent. The buildings and structures in the forum provide clear evidence of its political and civic functions for archaeologists.

Public entertainment venues like amphitheaters, theaters, circuses were also common features of Roman towns. Amphitheaters staged events like gladiatorial combats and animal hunts, while theaters hosted plays and other performances. The distinctive shapes and architectural features of amphitheaters and theaters signify their purpose as entertainment venues. For example, amphitheaters had oval shapes and series of tiers for spectators, while theaters had semi-circular shapes. Circuses were sites of chariot races, parades, and games. Like amphitheaters and theaters, the long narrow shapes, tiers of seating, and adjacent stables provide clues to archaeologists about the recreational function of circuses.  

Religious worship sites, including temples, shrines and sacred spaces, were important components of Roman towns. Roman polytheism resulted in temples devoted to a variety of deities with distinctive architectural styles. For example, square temples were associated with goddesses like Venus, while round temples were dedicated to Vesta. Other temples had more complex designs dedicated to the major gods like Jupiter or Juno. Some temples were converted from earlier religious designs, while others were newly built in the Roman style. The style, ornamentation, statuary, and surrounding sacred spaces help signify the religious functions of these sites to archaeologists.  

Areas of private housing and occupation made up a significant portion of most Roman towns. Wealthy citizens lived in domus, large houses built around an open courtyard, while most ordinary Romans lived in apartment blocks called insulae. The architectural details and mosaics found in domus point to their function as upper-class private homes. The more modest facilities and living spaces in insulae similarly indicate their purpose as lower-class apartment buildings. The remains of furniture, cookware, and decorations in these structures also provide clues to how people lived in these private residences on a daily basis.

Finally, Roman towns contained areas of trade and commerce, like markets, shops, and merchant stalls. Markets were large open squares used for selling goods and conducting trade. They were usually located within or adjacent to the forum. Archaeologists determine sites were used for commerce by identifying indications of economic activity from buildings with open spaces for trade, shop installations like counter tops and scales, or by the debris and unique goods and coins found remaining at the site. For example, merchant streets or "tabernae" were lined with shops and stalls and provided indication of intense buying and selling.

While archaeologists can identify the likely functions of Roman towns from the historical record and excavated remains, there are some challenges that arise when applying models. Limited preservation of organic materials like wood limits insight into structural specifics. There may be conflicting evidence that challenges clear classification, or a site may have had multiple successive functions over time that are hard to disentangle. Despite these complexities, however, Roman towns offer rich evidence for testing and applying morphological models of urban life by archaeologists.
