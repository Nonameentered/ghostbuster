A soft tissue injury refers to damage to the muscles, ligaments, and tendons in the body. These injuries are common and can range from minor to severe, causing inflammation, pain, and loss of function. Treatment focuses on reducing pain and swelling, restoring range of motion and strength, and enabling a gradual return to normal activities.  

For example, a 35-year-old patient, Jane, suffered a grade II ankle sprain while playing tennis. She landed awkwardly on her left foot, twisting her ankle. Jane went to an urgent care clinic where an x-ray confirmed no broken bones. The doctor diagnosed a sprain of the ligaments in her ankle. To treat the sprain, the doctor prescribed rest, ice, compression, and elevation (the R.I.C.E. method). Jane was instructed to stay off the ankle as much as possible, apply ice packs for 20 minutes at a time, wear a compression bandage, and keep her foot elevated above heart level.   

Over the next week, Jane followed up with a physical therapist who guided her through range-of-motion and strengthening exercises for her ankle. The therapist used hands-on techniques like massage to help reduce swelling. Jane received an ankle brace to wear for stability and gradually increased the amount of weight she put on her foot based on her pain tolerance. After two weeks, Jane's pain and range of motion continued to improve, but her ankle remained swollen and weak. Her therapist ensured Jane did not try any inversion or eversion of the ankle that could re-sprain the ligaments.  

Jane's concerns throughout the recovery process primarily related to returning to normal activity levels too quickly. Re-injury was possible for 4 to 6 weeks post-sprain. The therapist ensured Jane did not return to more intense workouts or sports activity until her pain was minimal, range of motion was restored, and strength was nearly back to normal levels. With diligent rest, physical therapy, and gradual resumption of activity over about 6 weeks, most grade II ankle sprains fully heal with no lasting loss of function or instability. In summary, with proper rest and rehabilitation of soft tissue injuries, most patients are able to return to their normal levels of activity and exercise over time.
