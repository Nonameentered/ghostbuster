Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography are two complementary techniques that provide evidence for the role of weak hydrogen bonding in the self-assembly of supramolecular structures. NMR spectroscopy detects the presence of hydrogen bonds through perturbations in the chemical shifts and spin-spin coupling constants of hydrogen and heteroatoms. However, the accuracy of NMR data in detecting hydrogen bonds depends on several factors. 

First, the strength of the hydrogen bond plays a role. Weaker hydrogen bonds typically produce smaller changes in NMR parameters, so they are more difficult to detect. Stronger hydrogen bonds can change chemical shifts by 0.3 ppm or more, clearly indicating their presence. Weaker hydrogen bonds may only change shifts by 0.1 ppm or less, leading to more ambiguous results.

Second, the geometry and number of hydrogen bonds matter. Hydrogen bonds in symmetric arrangements, or those that involve multiple hydrogen bonds to the same atom, generally produce greater changes in NMR spectra and are easier to identify. A single weak hydrogen bond may be missed, especially if using 1H NMR alone. 13C or 15N NMR can provide more insight, as the chemical shifts of carbon and nitrogen atoms also change upon hydrogen bonding.

Third, the choice of solvent and concentration influences the accuracy of NMR hydrogen bond detection. Hydrogen bonding interactions are often stronger in less polar solvents and at higher concentrations. These conditions lead to greater changes in chemical shifts, producing more definitive NMR evidence of hydrogen bonding. In some cases, a solvent may disrupt or compete with hydrogen bonds, obscuring them in NMR spectra.

X-ray crystallography provides complementary structural data that confirms the presence of hydrogen bonds suggested by NMR. The short interatomic distances between potential hydrogen bond donors and acceptors give direct evidence for their bonding interaction. The alignment of covalent and hydrogen bonds in the crystal lattice also supports the role of hydrogen bonding in the self-assembly process.

By combining NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, more conclusive evidence for hydrogen bonding in supramolecular systems can be obtained. NMR detects the signatures of hydrogen bonds in solution and provides preliminary structural information, while crystal structures confirm the bonding arrangements and geometry. Using these techniques in tandem leads to a more complete understanding of hydrogen bonding-directed self-assembly at the molecular level.
