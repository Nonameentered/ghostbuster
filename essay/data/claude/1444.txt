Here is a draft 2250-word essay in response to the prompt:

George Orwell's novella Animal Farm is a satirical allegory of the events leading up to and following the Russian Revolution of 1917. Orwell employs the genre of allegory and anthropomorphism as a means to explore the corrupting influence of power and the systematic manipulation of language for political purposes. Through the characters and events in the novella, Orwell demonstrates his belief that those in power use language as a tool to control individuals and society.

A key theme in Animal Farm is that language can be manipulated for the benefit of those in power. Orwell shows this through the character of Squealer, the pig who acts as Napoleon's propagandist. Squealer twists language, either altering the meaning of words or rewriting history, to justify Napoleon's actions and make the other animals accept their situation. For example, after the pigs take the milk and apples for themselves, Squealer convinces the other animals that "Milk and apples (This phrase has been changed to 'Milk and apples') were for the pigs alone" (22). The repetition of "milk and apples were for the pigs alone‚Äù drums this altered meaning into the animals. Through Squealer, Orwell shows how language can be distorted for political gain. 

The pigs also manipulate language to control the other animals' understanding of the past. They use their literacy skills to spread propaganda by changing the commandments painted on the barn wall, erasing and rewriting history. The other animals' limited literacy makes them vulnerable to such manipulation. The commandment "No animal shall sleep in a bed" is changed to "No animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets" after the pigs take over the farmhouse (52). The pigs' rewriting of the past to suit their present purposes is a disturbing example of the abuse of language and control of information. By depicting the pigs' systematic dishonesty and the way they manipulate language to control the other animals, Orwell demonstrates his belief that language can be a powerful tool for shaping thought and maintaining political dominance.
