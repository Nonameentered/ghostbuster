Interferometers are instruments that utilize the interference of light waves to make precise measurements. They have been instrumental in many foundational discoveries in optics and astronomy. However, they also have some limitations that must be considered and addressed to obtain accurate results.

One use of interferometers is to determine the wavelength of light. This was demonstrated in an investigation that measured the wavelengths of the sodium doublet at 589 nm and 589.6 nm. By passing light from a sodium lamp through a diffraction grating to split it into spectra and then recombining the wavelengths with an interferometer, the interference fringes could be counted to calculate the wavelengths. The accuracy of this measurement depended on precisely counting the fringes and on the quality and resolution of the optical components like the diffraction grating. Using high-quality components and taking multiple measurements helped address these factors.

Interferometers can also be used to determine the coherence length of a light source, which is the distance over which its wavefront remains coherent or “in phase.”  In the experiment, the coherence lengths of white light and light from a mercury lamp were found by measuring the visibility of interference fringes as a function of the path length difference in the interferometer. The lower the visibility, the shorter the coherence length. The accuracy of these measurements depended on the stability and alignment of the interferometer optical paths as the path length was changed. Precise construction and minimizing disturbances helped address these challenges.

Another use is measuring refractive indices. The refractive index depends on the wavelength of light, so by passing monochromatic light from various sources through a gas in an interferometer and measuring the resulting interference patterns, the refractive index at different wavelengths can be calculated. The main factors influencing accuracy are the purity of the gases used, precise measurement of pressure and temperature, and stability of the light sources. Using high purity gases, sensitive gauges, and stable current/temperature controls for the light sources helped optimize accuracy. 

In summary, interferometers have been invaluable for measuring wavelengths, coherence lengths, and refractive indices. However, their use depends on addressing factors like counting errors, optical and mechanical stability, environmental disturbances, and purity of materials. When these considerations were properly handled, as in the sodium doublet experiment, highly accurate and meaningful results were obtained. With continued technological progress enabling even more precise control and measurement, interferometers will continue enabling discoveries at the frontiers of physics and astronomy.
