The practical involved nested quadrats to determine the distribution of trees in a beechwood using random plotless sampling. The expected results were to obtain data on the density and distribution of beech trees  across the study site. By randomly locating quadrats without plots, an unbiased representation of the tree population was achieved. 

The plotless sampling method found a clustered distribution of beech trees, with some areas of high density and others with few or no trees. Several factors likely led to the planting of beech trees in the area, including the ability of beech trees to thrive in dry, sandy, and acidic soil conditions, as well as the usefulness of beechwood for lumber and firewood.

The vegetation study examined several vegetation types, including grassland, heathland, and woodland. The woodland was dominated by beech trees. The heathland featured plants such as heather, while the grassland included species such as wavy hair grass. Regular burning of the heathland resulted in a patchy distribution of plants due to the varying levels of damage from fire. Over time, in the absence of disturbance, the vegetation will proceed through stages of succession until woodland is re-established, demonstrating cyclical succession.

A transect through Broadmoor Heath aimed to examine changes in vegetation along a slope. The results showed a correlation between vegetation type and topography, with heather dominating at higher elevations and wavy hair grass more common at lower elevations. The underground material, including the levels of nutrients and soil pH, likely influenced the distribution of plants along the slope. Acidic, nutrient-poor soil higher up the slope supported heather, while more neutral soil lower down enabled the growth of grasses.

In summary, the practical used nested quadrats and plotless sampling to determine the distribution of a population of beech trees. Study of different vegetation types and a transect provided an understanding of how environmental factors and disturbance shape the diversity of plants that can inhabit an area. Examination of underground material demonstrated its influence on vegetation at a local scale.
