Here is a 2000-word essay in response to the prompt:

There are several important considerations to keep in mind when preparing a teaching session for adult learners. First, adult learners have typically accumulated a wealth of experiences, beliefs, and ways of thinking about the world that should be taken into account in lesson planning. Understanding their backgrounds, experiences, interests, and values will allow the instruction to be tailored to their needs and better engage them in the learning process. 

Second, it is important to connect any new learning to their existing knowledge and experiences. Help the adult learners see the relevance and applicability of the new information or skill to their daily work or lives. For example, in teaching a breathing exercise, explain how controlled breathing can reduce stress and anxiety in their daily lives. Use examples and analogies that link to their experiences.

Third, adult learners need to be actively involved in the learning process. They learn best by doing, practicing and discussing, not just by listening. Interactive and experiential techniques, such as group discussions, hands-on practice, simulations or role-plays should be integrated into the lesson plan. For a breathing exercise, guide the learners through the actual experience of the exercise with opportunities to ask questions and discuss the impacts and sensations.

Fourth, real-world problem-solving and critical thinking should be incorporated into the instruction. Pose scenarios, questions and activities that involve analysis and evaluation. Challenge the learners to apply their new knowledge or skill to complex situations. In the breathing exercise example, discuss how the technique could be applied in a high-stress work scenario or a conflict situation at home.

Finally, the teaching methodology should match the learning preferences of the group. Some may prefer visual materials, interactive activities and group work, while others prefer lecturing, logical sequencing and independent study. Using a variety of methods and mediums will cater to all the adult learners in the session. In the case of teaching a practical skill, a multi-modal approach combining lecture or discussion with interactive practice and visual aids is appropriate for most adult learners.

In evaluating learning for adult students, multiple measures should be used, including both objective indicators and self-reported perceptions. For a skill-based lesson like the breathing exercise, objective measures include observing the learners performing the skill to gauge their level of competence and accuracy. Questionnaires or surveys can also be used to gain the learners' perspectives on what they found most and least useful and what they feel they still need to master. Changes in knowledge or ways of thinking can also be measured by comparing "before and after" questionnaires. 

Other indicators of learning include the learner's ability to teach the skill or concept to another person, the application of the learning to new contexts as demonstrated through scenarios or role plays, and the documented changes that learners have made in their behaviors, actions or specific results as a consequence of the learning. For the breathing technique, the ultimate indicator would be learners continuing to practice and apply the exercise on their own and reporting reduced anxiety and improved focus and concentration in their daily lives.

In summary, considering the experiences, interests and learning preferences of adult learners, using relatable and interactive instructional techniques, incorporating real-world application, and employing objective and subjective evaluation measures can help to ensure that learning occurs in an educational session for adults. By following these guidelines, a skill like a practical breathing exercise can be taught to adult learners in an engaging and effective way with measurable impacts.
