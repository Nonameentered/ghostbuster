How Accurate is the Science in Jules Verne's 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth'? 

Jules Verne's 1864 science fiction classic 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth' tells the story of Professor Lidenbrock and his nephew Axel traveling down into a volcanic crater in Iceland and discovering a vast underground world populated with long-extinct creatures. When evaluating how scientifically accurate Verne's imaginative tale is, it's important to consider the state of scientific knowledge at the time it was written in the mid-19th century.

In some ways, Verne showed a remarkable prescience about discoveries yet to come. For example, his description of an underground sea and dramatic volcanic activity deep beneath the earth's surface anticipated later discoveries of underground aquifers and active volcanic processes in the earth's mantle. His inclusion of giant mushrooms, insects, and reptiles inhabiting the inner world pointed to later realizations that life originally evolved in ancient seas, not on land. 

However, much of the science in Verne's story reflects theories that were speculative or have since been disproven. The notion that the earth's interior contains vast open spaces, giant forests, and active wildlife is implausible given the extreme heat and pressure inside the planet. Verne's characters descend to a depth of over 800 kilometers, but in reality the temperature would be over 1,500Â°C at just 50 km down, far too hot to sustain life or passage. 

The timeline of life on earth presented in the story is also inaccurate. Verne depicts ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and pterosaurs - all extinct reptiles that lived over 60 million years apart from each other. His characters even encounter a live pterosaur, though they had been extinct for 65 million years by the time the story is set. Verne was limited by the knowledge available in his time, before modern geology, paleontology, and evolutionary theory established the actual chronology of life's development on earth.

While imaginative and visionary, Verne's scientific speculations in 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth' were often far-fetched or fanciful, reflecting more the spirit of scientific wonder and possibility in the 19th century than the actual state of knowledge. His work was instrumental in helping to inspire generations to explore the unknown and push the boundaries of human discovery. But with the benefit of modern science, we can see that much of the 'science' in Verne's classic tale was more fiction than fact.
