Here is a draft 1500 word essay in response to the prompt:

The Inca Empire was a highly centralized state that relied on strict control and conformity to maintain its power. The Inca elite, including the Sapa Inca (emperor) and priestly class, employed religion as a key tool to expand their empire, subjugate conquered peoples, and enforce conformity across their large territory in the Andes.

To expand the empire, the Inca conducted religiously-motivated military campaigns against neighboring groups. The Inca saw their rule as divinely ordained, and they believed their gods required them to conquer new lands. Military victories and territorial expansion were seen as signs of religious and political legitimacy. The Inca would first try to conquer groups through diplomatic means by claiming religious or cultural ties, but they would use military force if those means failed.  

Once conquered, the Inca employed religion to subjugate and control newly incorporated subjects. They built grand religious monuments, temples, and administrative centers in conquered regions to instill awe in the local populations.  The Inca required subject peoples to venerate the Inca gods and the Sapa Inca.  They forcibly moved populations to break up old loyalties and ensure allegiance to Cusco. Subjects had to speak Quechua, the language of the Inca. These measures allowed the Inca elite to closely monitor their subjects and stamp out any resistance or deviation from Inca religious norms.

To enforce conformity over their large, diverse population, the Inca spread their state religion in the form of the worship of Inti (the sun god), the Sapa Inca, and huacas (sacred objects). They built an extensive network of shrines, temples and religious infrastructure across the empire. Subject peoples had to provide resources and labor as tribute and for religious ceremonies and rituals. The Inca calendar controlled religious festivals and rituals across the empire. Through regular pilgrimages to Cusco, the Inca reinforced the religious basis of Inca power over their subjects. 

In summary, Inca religion was systematically employed as a political tool to aid in imperial expansion, exercise control over conquered populations, and enforce conformity to Inca norms.  The Inca elite were able to harness religion to support their highly centralized state apparatus through a mix of persuasion, force, and manipulation.  Religion allowed the Inca to justify their rule, subjugate diverse groups, and create a degree of cultural cohesion within their large, multiethnic territory.
