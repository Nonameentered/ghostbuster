The Roman poets Virgil and Propertius present two very different portrayals of love in their works. Virgil, in the Aeneid, depicts love as a destructive force through the doomed relationship between Dido and Aeneas. Propertius, meanwhile, adopts a more subversive stance in highlighting the powerful and harmful effects of love on the individual in his elegies. Both poets challenge the normative views of love in their time to various degrees.   

In Virgil's Aeneid, the love between Dido and Aeneas ultimately proves destructive due to the will of the gods. Their budding romance is cut short by a divine mandate forcing Aeneas to leave Carthage to fulfill his destiny of founding Rome. Virgil portrays the effects of this separation as tragic. Dido is ravaged by heartbreak and betrayal, which eventually drive her to take her own life upon a pyre. Her story warns that love leads to suffering, at least for mortals who go against the designs of the gods. Dido's despair reflects poorly on Aeneas as well, making him appear callous and indifferent to her emotions. Their ill-fated relationship serves as a cautionary tale about the ruin that can result when love conflicts with duty. 

While Dido and Aeneas' love challenges the gods' authority, it does reflect some social norms regarding gender roles. Dido is portrayed as an irrational woman dominated by passions, while Aeneas acts stoically in obedience to his divine mission. However, Virgil also elicits sympathy for Dido and implies the gods are cruel in demanding Aeneas abandon her. The tragedy of their love suggests love's destructive power arises from forces outside human control. Overall, Virgil presents a complex, ambiguous vision of love that both reflects and subverts aspects of Augustan morality.

In contrast, Propertius adopts a stance that more directly challenges conventional attitudes about love. He portrays love as an overpowering force that strips the lover of dignity and agency, reducing him to a "slave" of passion. The sophisticated wit and irony Propertius employs, however, suggest his intent is not simply to moralize about love's dangers. Rather, his elegies imply a subversive view that the social institution of love, not love itself, is the true source of harm.

For example, in Poem IV.8, Propertius explores the theme of lovers' quarrels through the metaphor of love as a military campaign. The poem humorously inverts the usual glorification of war by portraying love as a futile "siege" that drains the lover's resources and leaves him in a weakened state. The metaphor presents love as an absurd social performance that brings the lover nothing but suffering and indignity. Yet the poem's ironic and self-aware mockery of the lover's plight hints at a sense that the lamented torments of love hold a perverse pleasure and meaning for the lover.

In conclusion, Virgil and Propertius provide two distinct Augustan perspectives on love that both reflect and challenge the social conventions of their time. Virgil portrays love as a destructive force subject to the authority of the gods, though not without a degree of sympathy for love's mortal victims. Propertius takes a more subversive stance in presenting love as an absurd and futile social institution that holds covert pleasures for the knowing lover along with its promised miseries. Both poets suggest love represents a power that mortals can attempt to resist or reform but never fully escape. Their works provide a window into the sophisticated, ambiguous ways in which the Augustan poets explored the central place of love in society and human experience.
