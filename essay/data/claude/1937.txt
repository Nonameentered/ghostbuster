What was Missing from Learning Persian and How It Could Have Been Better 

Learning a new language as an adult can be an immensely rewarding yet challenging experience. I recently spent several months studying Persian, also known as Farsi, through an online course and self-study. While I was able to achieve a basic level of proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking, there were several key components missing from the experience that would have helped me become more fluent and adept with the language.

The first major shortcoming was the lack of conversation practice. Online courses and apps are useful for learning vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation, but they do not provide opportunities for authentic conversations. Speaking with others, whether with native speakers or fellow learners, is essential for developing conversational fluency, learning informal language styles, and improving listening comprehension. Options like conversation exchanges via video chat, meetups with other learners, or working with a private tutor would have provided the interactive speaking time I needed.

A second limitation was the lack of cultural context. Learning a new language also means learning about the culture, values, and daily life of native speakers. My self-study primarily focused on grammar and vocabulary, with little emphasis on Persian media, films, books, or current events. Having access to authentic cultural materials, media, and entertainment is key to building fluency and deepening understanding. In the future, I would seek out Persian films, TV shows, books, newspapers, and podcasts to immerse myself in the language and culture.

A third shortcoming was learning in isolation. While self-study requires motivation and discipline, it can be an isolating experience. A classroom environment, whether physical or virtual, provides community support and encouragement. It also exposes you to multiple voices and learning strategies from both teachers and fellow students. For complex languages like Persian, guidance from an experienced teacher is particularly helpful in navigating new vocabularies, scripts, and grammatical concepts.  

In summary, while I was able to learn basic Persian through an online course and self-study, key elements were missing from the experience that would have strengthened my learning. Speaking practice, cultural immersion, and community support are invaluable for mastering a new language. For my next language learning endeavor, I will be sure to incorporate interactive conversation, engage deeply with cultural materials, media and entertainment, and find a teacher or learning community to guide me along the way. With persistence and the right tools, learning a challenging language like Persian can be attainable and deeply rewarding.
