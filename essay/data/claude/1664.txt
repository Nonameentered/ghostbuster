Google Book Search (GBS) is a controversial project launched by Google in 2004 to digitize millions of books from major research libraries and make them searchable online. The project has raised many issues around copyright, business models, cultural heritage, and access to information. 

GBS has significant impacted authors and publishers by making a large corpus of books searchable and accessible online for free. This raises concerns over copyright violations and loss of revenue, as readers can search and view large portions of copyrighted books. Publishers argue this availability negatively impacts book sales. In response, Google implemented a "snippet view" that only shows a few lines of text around the search term, as well as a partner program that shares ad revenue with publishers who agree to make books fully viewable. However, many authors and publishers still oppose the project.

GBS has the potential to disrupt traditional publishing business models which rely on exclusive control of intellectual property and revenue from book sales. In contrast, Google generates revenue through selling ads on the GBS platform and adjacent Google services. Some argue this model reduces incentives for publishers to continue publishing less commercially-viable books. However, others counter that GBS increases access and exposure for all books, which can boost overall readership and support for authors and publishers.

The project also raises concerns over control of cultural heritage and identity. By digitizing library collections, GBS provides a valuable public service for accessing and preserving knowledge. However, some argue this should be done by public institutions like libraries, not a private corporation driven by commercial interests. There are concerns Google may abuse its control of access or fail to represent less dominant cultures. In response, public institutions could regain more control over their digital collections.

In summary, GBS remains controversial due to unresolved issues around copyright, business models, and control of cultural heritage. However, it also provides significant public benefits through increased access to knowledge. Resolving this tension will rely on cooperation between Google, authors, publishers, libraries, and the public. Overall, GBS shows how digitization and new business models can disrupt existing systems of knowledge creation and access, raising both new opportunities and challenges.
