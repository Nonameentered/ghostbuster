The primary cause of the patient's episodes of ventricular tachycardia appears to be the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia or ARVC. ARVC is a congenital heart disease in which the right ventricle becomes replaced with fatty and fibrous tissue that is unable to conduct electrical impulses properly. This can lead to reentrant arrhythmias, particularly ventricular tachycardia originating from the right ventricle. The fatty infiltration and scarring of the myocardium in ARVC creates areas of slowed conduction which can facilitate the reentry circuit required to sustain the ventricular tachycardia. 

Excess alcohol consumption can negatively impact the myocardium in several ways that may increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Ethanol exposure is associated with direct toxic effects on cardiomyocytes which can lead to apoptosis and cell death. This loss of functioning heart muscle cells can contribute to the development of fatty replacement of the myocardium seen in ARVC. Alcohol also leads to a state of oxidative stress in the heart which can damage mitochondria, proteins, and DNA. The products of lipid peroxidation from oxidative stress may be arrhythmogenic. Finally, alcohol abuse is associated with electrolyte disturbances like hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia which can make the heart more susceptible to arrhythmic events.

The diagnosis of ARVC usually requires multiple testing modalities given the challenges in making the diagnosis based on any single test. Diagnostic criteria include demonstration of global or regional dysfunction and structural alterations of the right ventricle including by echocardiography, cardiac MRI, angiography or scintigraphy. Electrocardiogram changes may show inverted T waves in right precordial leads and epsilon waves. Family history of ARVC or premature sudden cardiac death also supports the diagnosis. Biopsy of the right ventricular myocardium showing fibrofatty replacement can confirm the diagnosis if other tests are inconclusive but carries risks and is not always necessary.

There are several options for the medical management of ventricular tachycardia in the setting of ARVC to help reduce symptoms and prevent sudden cardiac death. Beta blockers are commonly used to help prevent tachyarrhythmias from arising and for rate control if VT does occur. Antiarrhythmic drugs like sotalol or amiodarone may be used to prevent recurrences of VT. Catheter ablation of the VT circuit may be performed in some patients to destroy the abnormal conduction pathway, especially if VT is resistant to drug therapy. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator or ICD is often recommended to prevent sudden death from lethal ventricular arrhythmias in high risk ARVC patients. For refractory VT in emergency situations, intravenous antiarrhythmics or sedation may need to be administered followed by cardioversion or defibrillation to restore a normal heart rhythm.
