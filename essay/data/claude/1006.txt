The shoreline environment varies with exposure to the sea and can be divided into distinct zones based on the species present. The splash zone at the highest level is sprayed by seawater but rarely submerged. It is a harsh environment, so only organisms tolerant to desiccation like barnacles and periwinkles inhabit this zone. 

The upper midlittoral zone is immersed during high tide. It contains species like limpets, mussels, and barnacles that can withstand exposure to air for long periods. The middle midlittoral zone contains more seaweeds like sea lettuce and snails like flat periwinkles that prefer damp rocks. The lower midlittoral zone is mostly submerged but exposed during the lowest tides. Species found here include gobies, starfish, and anemones.

The sublittoral fringe is always submerged and dominated by seaweeds like kelp and animals like sea urchins, starfish, and crabs. Below this is the sublittoral zone that is never exposed, containing mostly fish and other fully aquatic species. The species change with depth due to differences in light, temperature, sedimentation, and wave action.

Exposed rocky shores experience strong wave action and tides, so the zones are less distinct and contain more well-adapted organisms like mussels, barnacles, and tough seaweeds. Sheltered shores have weaker wave action and wider tidal range, so the zones are more well-defined and contain more delicate species like sea slugs, sea anemones, and red seaweeds. 

Variation in marine life depends on both biological and physical factors. Biological factors include predation, competition, and settlement. Physical factors include light availability, salinity, temperature, oxygen level, rock type, tidal exposure, and sediment. The permeability and stability of the rock determine attachment opportunities for sea life. Finer sediments offer more chances for burrowing while large boulders give more surface area for settlement. 

The beach survey did not include microorganisms and plankton which form the base of the food chain and drive nutrient cycling. Bacteria break down organic matter and release nutrients for primary producers like phytoplankton which in turn feed zooplankton and the rest of the food web. Planktonic larvae of benthic species also contribute to the ecology of rocky shores during their pelagic stage.   

Studying zonation of species on beaches gives insight into ecological and evolutionary processes. It reveals organismsâ€™ physiological adaptations to their environment and interactions with other species. Monitoring changes in zonation over time can detect the effects of natural and anthropogenic impacts on coastal ecosystems. Protection and conservation of shoreline habitats rely on understanding the factors controlling species distribution. Zonation studies have broad applications in ecology, evolution, biodiversity, and environmental management.
