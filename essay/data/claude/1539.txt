Here is a 2250 word essay in response to the prompt:

Wilkinson has recently acquired Hoopoe, a smaller competitor in the lifestyle brand industry. For Wilkinson to fully benefit from this acquisition and achieve its strategic goals, it is critical that the two companies are integrated effectively. This will require careful planning and execution from Wilkinson's management team to integrate Hoopoe successfully while navigating potential challenges.

First, Wilkinson needs to establish clear strategic objectives for the acquisition and integration of Hoopoe. The overall vision should align with Wilkinson's broader growth strategy. Potential objectives could include gaining access to new customers, expanding into new geographic markets where Hoopoe has a strong presence, leveraging Hoopoe's innovative products to enhance Wilkinson's portfolio, and achieving cost savings through consolidating operations. 

With the objectives set, Wilkinson can design an integration plan to optimize synergies between the two companies. One key strategy is to integrate Hoopoe's systems and processes with Wilkinson's, including financial reporting, HR systems, payroll, and IT infrastructure. This may require significant upfront investment but will enable data sharing and consistent ways of working in the long run. At the same time, Wilkinson should evaluate which of Hoopoe's systems and practices are superior and could replace Wilkinson's existing ones.

Another priority is integrating the workforce and culture. To address staff resistance, management should communicate openly and frequently about the acquisition's strategic rationale and benefits. They should also provide opportunities for the legacy Wilkinson and Hoopoe staff to network and interact, to facilitate understanding and collaboration between the teams. Additionally, Wilkinson may provide retention incentives for key Hoopoe staff, as well as training and development opportunities to equip employees with new skills for their integrated roles.

Structurally, management will need to determine an organizational framework that leverages Hoopoe's strengths while aligning with Wilkinson's model. Potential options include merging selected Hoopoe business units into Wilkinson's existing divisions based on product, customer or location similarities. Alternatively, Hoopoe could be reorganized as a standalone division within Wilkinson, maintaining its own branding and mission but reporting directly to Wilkinson's leadership.  

In terms of branding, Wilkinson will need to decide whether to retain the Hoopoe brand or transition Hoopoe's customers and products to the Wilkinson brand. Factors to consider include Hoopoe's brand equity, how closely Hoopoe's and Wilkinson's brands and target customers align, and the potential impact to revenue and customers. If the brands remain separate, marketing messages must be coordinated to avoid confusion while continuing to differentiate the brands.

The key challenges Wilkinson may face include: lack of cooperation from Hoopoe staff, loss of key talent, and fluctuations in revenue or productivity during transition periods. Another risk is that the acquisition may not achieve the expected synergies and benefits due to poor integration or incompatible organizational cultures. However, with strong leadership commitment, clear strategic vision, open communication, and a thoughtful integration plan emphasizing value creation, Wilkinson will be poised to overcome obstacles and capitalize on this opportunity for growth. Overall, effective integration of Hoopoe could significantly strengthen Wilkinson's market leadership and brand portfolio.
