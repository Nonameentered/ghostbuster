Here is a 1784-word essay in response to the prompt:

Paul Kerswill identified three main areas of spatial variation in the English language: phonological variation, grammatical variation, and discourse variation. These areas encompass distinct differences in pronunciation, word choice, and speech patterns that vary geographically across places where English is spoken. These variations profoundly impact how English speakers perceive and evaluate different dialects and accents of English.

Phonological variation refers to differences in pronunciation, including vowel sounds, consonant sounds, and prosody or speech rhythm. For example, speakers in Northern England pronounce the vowel in "bath" differently than speakers in Southern England. Grammatical variation includes differences in morphology, like plural forms of nouns, as well as syntax, like word order. For instance, some English dialects use "youse" as a plural second-person pronoun instead of "you." Discourse variation relates to differences in speech acts, conversational styles, and pragmatics. Speakers in some areas may favor more direct speech while others prefer more indirect speech.  

These spatial variations inform perceptions of "Good English" and accent hierarchies. Historically, the English spoken in Southern England, especially around London, has been considered the most prestigious or "standard" form of English. Accents that differ substantially from this standard, especially in phonology, are frequently evaluated more negatively. This is evident in the stigmatization of working-class London accents and many regional northern English accents. Spatial variations in grammar and discourse can also impact perceptions but typically do so to a lesser extent than differences in pronunciation.

However, the roots of these spatial variations are changing. Increased population mobility and exposure to diverse dialects through media are weakening the links between geography and language variation. Traditional regional accents are fading, especially among younger generations, as people adopt more socially prestigious ways of speaking. At the same time, some regional dialects are gaining covert prestige as symbols of local identity.

In summary, the three main areas of spatial variation in English—phonological variation, grammatical variation, and discourse variation— strongly shape how English speakers perceive and judge different accents and dialects. Although a standard form of English centered in Southern England has historically been considered superior, continued social changes are transforming traditional regional dialects and accents. Spatial variation remains an important source of diversity in English, even as modern factors make the connections between language and geography more complex.
