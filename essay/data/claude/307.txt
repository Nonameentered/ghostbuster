The East Asian Tigers, comprising South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, experienced rapid economic growth from the 1960s through 1990s. Their real GDP growth rates averaged 7-8% per annum during this period, enabling them to transition from developing to developed countries within a few decades. Several factors propelled their economic miracles. 

First, the Tigers pursued export-oriented trade policies that took advantage of global market opportunities. They exported labor-intensive manufactured goods like textiles and electronics and imported raw materials and technology. These policies attracted foreign direct investment, boosted job creation, and increased foreign exchange reserves. Export orientation also spurred knowledge transfers that raised productivity. The Tigers were well-positioned to take advantage of postwar global trade expansion and growing demand for their products in Western markets.

Second, the Tigers had pro-growth economic policies emphasizing high savings and investment. Their tax codes, interest rates, and financial sectors encouraged savings. High savings rates, averaging over 30% of GDP, funded massive investments in human and physical capital. The Tigers invested heavily in education, job skills training, and infrastructure like ports, roads, and telecommunications equipment. These investments boosted productivity and supported export competitiveness.  

Third, the Tigers had demographic advantages that contributed to high savings and economic growth. Their populations had high life expectancies but declining fertility rates, creating low age dependency ratios. With fewer children and elderly to support, more individuals were able to save and invest. The large working-age populations also provided a ample cheap labor for export industries. Demographic shifts were influenced by rising standards of living, increased female education, and family planning programs.

In conclusion, the East Asian Tigers achieved remarkable economic growth through outward orientation, pro-growth policies, high human and physical capital investment, and a demographic dividend. Export-led development strategies and demographic advantages fueled productivity, competitiveness, and high savings rates. Pro-growth policies encouraged massive investments in infrastructure, education, and job training that laid the groundwork for long-term prosperity. The Tigers offer lessons for developing countries on the benefits of global economic engagement and human development.
