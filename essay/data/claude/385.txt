Motor neurone disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. These motor neurons control muscle movement, and as they degenerate and die, the ability to move, speak, swallow and breathe gradually deteriorates.

There are several classifications of MND based on the location and pattern of motor neuron degeneration. The most common are limb-onset MND which starts in the limbs, bulbar-onset MND which starts in the bulbar region affecting speech and swallowing, and respiratory-onset MND which starts in the thoracic region affecting breathing. Regardless of classification, the disease will spread to other motor neuron regions over time. 

The symptoms of MND depend on which motor neurons are affected but usually include muscle weakness or stiffness, twitching, and cramping. As the disease progresses to different motor neuron regions, symptoms such as slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and problems breathing emerge. However, the senses and mind remain intact. The rate of progression varies from person to person but sadly the disease is invariably fatal, often within 2 to 5 years of diagnosis.

There is currently no cure for MND. Management options focus on relieving symptoms and slowing progression. Riluzole is the only drug shown to slightly prolong survival. It works by decreasing damage to motor neurons. Non-drug interventions include physical therapy, speech therapy, nutritional support, and respiratory aids.  

Communicating this prognosis is challenging but honesty and optimism are needed. Patients should understand their disease will continue progressing while focusing on maintaining quality of life. Discussing end-of-life choices in advance ensures patient wishes are respected. These difficult conversations should be handled with sensitivity, empathy and compassion.

In summary, motor neurone disease is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that destroys motor neurons controlling voluntary muscle movement. Classifications are based on location of onset but the disease ultimately spreads. Symptoms accumulate as more motor neurons degenerate, impacting mobility, speech, swallowing and breathing. Riluzole modestly slows progression but otherwise management focuses on symptom relief. Prognosis discussions and end-of-life planning are essential but difficult parts of caring for patients with this progressive and terminal disease.
