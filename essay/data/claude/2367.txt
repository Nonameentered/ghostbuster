Meniscus forms at the surface of some liquids due to the adhesive and cohesive forces between the molecules of the liquid itself and between the liquid molecules and the molecules of the surrounding container. Adhesive forces refer to the attraction between the molecules of different substances, such as between the molecules of a liquid and those of a container holding the liquid. Cohesive forces refer to the attraction between molecules of the same liquid. The formation of a meniscus depends on the relative strength of the adhesive forces compared to the cohesive forces. 

For example, water has strong cohesive forces, due to hydrogen bonds between water molecules. The water molecules attract each other more than they attract the molecules of materials like glass or plastic that containers are made of. As a result, water forms a convex meniscus in most containers—the surface curves up. The strong attraction between water molecules pulls the molecules at the surface together, causing the surface to curve. Mercury, on the other hand, has weak cohesive forces but strong adhesive forces with glass and many other materials. So mercury forms a concave meniscus in glass containers—the surface curves down—as the adhesive forces between the mercury and glass attract the mercury molecules at the surface toward the container edges.

The thermodynamics of liquid mixtures is also important for understanding meniscus formation. According to the second law of thermodynamics, the total entropy or disorder of an isolated system will always increase over time until it reaches equilibrium. Liquids and their surfaces represent such thermodynamic systems. The molecules in a liquid are mobile and able to move and rearrange. The surface molecules, in particular, experience an asymmetric environment with no molecules above them. This asymmetry means the surface molecules have higher energy and disorder than molecules in the bulk liquid. 

At equilibrium, the system will achieve a state of maximum entropy overall, which often means minimizing the surface area to volume ratio to reduce the number of high-energy surface molecules. For a liquid in a container, the shape that minimizes surface area and maximizes disorder depends on the relative strength of adhesive and cohesive forces. If cohesive forces dominate, a convex meniscus forms. If adhesive forces dominate, a concave meniscus forms. At the minimum surface area for a given volume, the total energy and disorder of the system are optimized at equilibrium based on the molecular forces involved.

In summary, meniscus formation depends on molecular forces and thermodynamic considerations. Stronger cohesive than adhesive forces produce a convex meniscus as molecules cling together, while stronger adhesive forces lead to a concave meniscus as molecules adhere to the container surface. At equilibrium, the liquid surface shape that minimizes surface area and maximizes disorder will form based on the interplay of cohesive and adhesive forces for a given liquid and container material. The strength and direction of curvature depend on the relative magnitudes of adhesion and cohesion according to the thermodynamics governing the system.
