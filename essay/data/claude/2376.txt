Brochs are stone tower structures found widely across Atlantic Scotland, particularly in the North and West. They are considered a significant architectural feature of the Iron Age in Scotland, with over 500 identified tower structures scattered across the region. However, the nature and purpose of brochs remains debated and contested.

The term 'broch' itself is contested and loosely defined. Brochs are circular stone towers with hollow, galleried interiors. They were first described in the 19th century by scholars who applied the local Shetland term 'brough' to these enigmatic structures. The name 'broch' has stuck and become widely used, though it is a fairly broad term that may encompass a variety of related stone towers with different construction methods and purposes. Some scholars argue for more specific classification systems, differentiating 'brochs' from 'galleried duns' and other types of towers. However, for the purposes of this essay, 'broch' will be used as a broad, encompassing term for these circular stone towers found across Atlantic Scotland.

In terms of dating, most brochs were constructed between 100 BC and 100 AD, during the Roman occupation of parts of Britain. However, some earlier and later examples have also been found. The distribution of brochs suggests they emerged in a context of political instability and conflict, possibly related to wider pressures from Roman expansion and activity in Britain. The construction of brochs is a massive undertaking, requiring organized labor and resources. This suggests they held some important function and value for Iron Age communities in Atlantic Scotland.

There are several theories as to the primary nature and function of brochs. The earliest interpretations in the 19th century viewed them as defensive structures, constructed in response to conflict. Some modern scholars continue to emphasize the defensive capability of brochs, noting their strong, imposing structure and strategic siting with wide views over land and sea. However, an exclusively defensive function is debated. The hollow, galleried interiors of brochs are unlike typical domestic architecture, making habitation unlikely. But brochs may have served as temporary refuges or safe storage sites. They could also have symbolic and political functions, as a display of a group's power and resources.

Other theories see brochs as high-status residences for local leaders and elites. The intricate architecture and massive scale of brochs suggest the organization and control of surplus resources, typical of hierarchical societies. The inner chambers may have served as secure living spaces, and the outer galleries monitored and controlled access. However, the lack of windows and rudimentary furnishings argue against long-term habitation. Brochs could have functioned as elite residences only periodically or seasonally.
