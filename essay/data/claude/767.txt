Here is a 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

The purpose of this laboratory experiment was to investigate the lateral and longitudinal forces acting on a rotating road tyre. As the tyre rotates, friction between the tyre and the road surface generates forces in the lateral and longitudinal directions. These forces were measured using load cells attached to the axle of the tyre. MATLAB was used to analyze the data from this experiment in several ways.

First, the raw data from the load cells was imported into MATLAB. This data contained the lateral and longitudinal force measurements in Newtons for each sample time over the duration of multiple tyre rotations. MATLAB was used to plot this raw data on a graph, with time on the x-axis and force on the y-axis. These initial plots showed periodic oscillations in the lateral and longitudinal forces over time, corresponding to a full rotation of the tyre. 

To better visualize the patterns in this data, MATLAB was used to apply a low-pass filter. This smoothed out high-frequency fluctuations and noise, revealing the underlying waveform shapes in the data. The filtered data showed roughly sinusoidal oscillations for the lateral and longitudinal forces. The frequencies of these oscillations matched the known rotation frequency of the tyre, confirming they corresponded to a single tyre rotation.

The phases of the lateral and longitudinal force sinusoids were examined to determine if the forces were in phase or out of phase. By overlaying the plots of lateral and longitudinal force against time, it could be seen that the sinusoids were roughly 180 degrees out of phase. This meant the lateral and longitudinal force maxima and minima occurred at opposite points within each tyre rotation.

MATLAB was also used to generate polar plots of the filtered force data. These polar plots presented the force magnitudes as radii from the origin and the tyre rotation angle as the angular coordinate. The polar plots showed clearly how the lateral and longitudinal forces varied in magnitude and direction over a complete tyre rotation. These plots revealed the forces were roughly equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. 

In summary, this laboratory experiment used load cells and MATLAB to measure and analyze the lateral and longitudinal forces acting on a rotating tyre. By filtering the raw data, plotting the data in various formats, and examining the phase relationships between the forces, patterns were discovered regarding how these friction forces vary in magnitude and direction during tyre rotation. The forces were found to oscillate in phase with the tyre rotation frequency and be roughly equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. MATLAB proved to be a very useful tool for visualizing and analyzing the data from this experiment.
