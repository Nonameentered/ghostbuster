There are many myths and misconceptions surrounding gender identities and the division of societal roles between men and women. These myths have developed over centuries and have been perpetuated by social conditioning and a variety of societal norms. Modern society, despite progress on certain social issues, has unfortunately also contributed to the proliferation of these myths.

One predominant myth is that there are only two genders - male and female. This myth arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of the complexity of gender identity. Gender exists on a spectrum, and a person can identify anywhere along that spectrum - or not on the spectrum at all. The gender binary myth contributes to discrimination and oppression of those who identify as non-binary, genderfluid or agender. Modern culture, with its emphasis on categorizing and labeling identities, has reinforced this myth. 

Another myth is that there are distinct societal roles for men and women. There is a notion that women should be primarily caregivers and homemakers, while men should be the primary breadwinners and leaders outside the home. This myth arises from centuries of patriarchal societies where gender determined one's place and purpose. While there has been significant progress, these stereotypes and societal pressures still persist in subtle ways today. Popular media, family dynamics and social conditioning all continue to propagate these anachronistic gender roles.

A further myth is that one's physical sex characteristics determine their gender. The truth is that sex and gender are two very different concepts. Sex refers to physical attributes, while gender refers to a person's internal sense of identity. Modern society, with its emphasis on physical traits, appearance and labels, fuels the notion that gender should be determined by one's sex. This contributes to the oppression and discrimination of those in the trans and gender non-conforming communities.

In conclusion, there are many myths surrounding gender identities and societal roles that have developed over time but have no factual or ethical basis. While modern society has made progress on some fronts, there are still many ways in which these myths are propagated and reinforced. By promoting inclusiveness, diversity and empathy, society can move beyond these debilitating myths. Overall, this essay explores some of the predominant gender myths, their historical roots, and how modern society has helped spread them, whether intentionally or not. There is still much work to be done to overcome these myths and create a more equitable and just world for people of all gender identities.
