Pregnancy toxaemia, also known as twin lamb disease or lambing sickness, is a metabolic disease that affects pregnant ewes, especially during late gestation or early lactation. It is caused by an energy imbalance where the ewe cannot consume enough energy to meet the demands of her pregnancy or lactation. This results in a breakdown of fat stores in the body to produce ketones as an alternative energy source. The buildup of ketones causes the symptoms of the disease and can have severe negative health impacts on the ewe and her lambs.

There are several factors that can contribute to the development of pregnancy toxaemia in ewes. The most significant risk factor is carrying multiple fetuses, especially triplets or quadruplets. The increased energy demands of the fetuses and subsequent lactation require much greater calorie intake, which many ewes struggle to achieve. Overfat ewes at breeding and during early pregnancy are also at higher risk, as they have more fat stores to mobilize for energy which produces ketones. Other risks include severe underfeeding or starvation during gestation, ewes with a history of pregnancy toxaemia in previous pregnancies, old or young ewes in their first pregnancy, and ewes carrying exceptionally large fetuses. 

The key symptoms of pregnancy toxaemia include inappetence, dullness or altered behavior, muscle tremors, and weakness or stumbling. As the disease progresses, symptoms become more severe with impaired vision, apparent blindness, recumbency, and convulsions in some cases. The breath may develop a sweet, fruity odor from the ketones. Without treatment, ewe mortality rates from pregnancy toxaemia can exceed 50 percent. Surviving ewes often experience permanent kidney or nerve damage. Lamb mortality rates are also high, with many lambs dying from premature birth or the ewe's inability to care for them after birth.

Treatment of ewes with pregnancy toxaemia includes intravenous administration of dextrose to provide an energy source and correct hypoglycemia, along with fluids to correct dehydration. This is usually administered over 3 to 4 days to stabilize the ewe. Oral propylene glycol or glycerol can also be given to provide energy and rehydrate the ewe. Anti-seizure medications are used to control convulsions. A C-section may be necessary to remove the lambs if the ewe's condition is unstable or not improving. Recovered ewes should continue to receive extra feed to meet elevated demands.

Prevention of pregnancy toxaemia focuses on proper flock nutrition and management. Ewes should be in moderate body condition at breeding and receive adequate nutritious feed during gestation, especially during the last 4 to 6 weeks. Grain supplements, beet pulp, or high-quality hay should be provided if forage quantity or quality is low. For high-risk ewes like those carrying multiples, separate feeding areas may be needed so they can receive extra feed. Ensuring ewes do not become overly fat or underfed at critical points of reproduction and monitoring ewes closely, especially for inappetence as they near lambing, are also key strategies for prevention. With diligent nutrition and care, especially of higher-risk ewes, pregnancy toxaemia can be avoided and ewes and lambs will experience better health and welfare.
