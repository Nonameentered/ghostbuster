Distribution channels in the travel and tourism industry refer to the methods by which travel and tourism organizations make their products and services available for purchase by consumers. There are a number of theoretical issues related to distribution channels in this industry.

First, there is a tension between the goals of the distribution channels and the goals of the travel companies. Distribution channels aim to provide consumers with information about and access to as many travel products as possible in order to make the shopping and booking experience as seamless as possible. In contrast, travel companies want to differentiate their own products and services to gain a competitive advantage. They may not want their offerings to be directly comparable with competitors on the distribution channels. This can create conflicts over how much information travel companies are willing to provide and how they allow their products to be displayed.

Second, distribution channels incur costs that must be paid for in some way. For example, travel companies have to pay fees to list their products on aggregator sites like Expedia and Priceline. They have to determine how to balance these costs with the benefits of increased visibility and access to customers. This is related to the economic theory of distribution channel efficiency. If the costs of a distribution channel outweigh the benefits, then it would be considered inefficient. Travel companies have to analyze the costs and benefits of each channel and ensure they are focusing their efforts on the most efficient channels.   

Finally, distribution channels provide different levels of control over the customer experience. Some channels, like a company's own website, provide maximum control, while other channels like online travel agencies and aggregators provide almost no control. Travel companies have to decide how much control they require and select distribution channels accordingly. They also have to ensure a consistent customer experience across channels, even those over which they have little control.    

These theoretical issues can be applied to a selected travel package, in this case a trip to Iceland. The package could be distributed through:

1. An online travel agency like Expedia. This is an aggregator that provides access to many different travel products from a range of suppliers. For customers, this provides extensive choice and the ability to compare different packages. However, the level of control and differentiation for the travel company is low. Fees charged by Expedia also reduce the revenue and margins for the travel company.

2. A package integrator like Iceland Travel. This bundles together different travel components like accommodation, transfers, and activities into a single packaged product. This provides customers with an easy, bundled purchase experience but still relatively little control or differentiation for the travel company. Fees are still charged but may be lower than an aggregator.   

3. The travel company's own website. This channel provides maximum control over the customer experience and presentation of the package. There are no additional fees, allowing the travel company to keep more of the revenue. However, the company website may have less web traffic and reach compared to the other channels, making it more difficult for customers to discover the package.

In summary, there are clear trade-offs between the three distribution channels from both a travel company and customer perspective. I would make the following recommendations for improvement:

1. The travel company should focus on enhancing its own website to provide the best customer experience. It can then utilize other channels more for customer acquisition before directing them to the website to make a purchase. This leverages the strengths of each channel.

2. On aggregator and integrator sites, the travel company should find ways to make its packages more differentiated through unique photos, videos, and descriptions. This creates a more curated feel that adds value for customers while still benefiting from the additional reach of these channels. 

3. The travel company should negotiate the lowest possible commission rates with the online travel agencies and package integrators. Any fees reduce margins, so lower is better as long as the channels are still efficient in attracting customers. 

In summary, developing an effective distribution channel strategy with the right mix of channels and improvements can help maximize a travel company's competitive advantage by balancing customer experience, differentiation, reach, efficiency, and control. With improvements to the customer experience on its own website and by enhancing product presentation on other channels, the travel company can leverage the strengths of each channel to effectively distribute its travel package to Iceland.
