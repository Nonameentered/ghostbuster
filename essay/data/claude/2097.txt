Here is a 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

The larynx, or voice box, plays a critical role in the production of obstruent consonant sounds, like stops, fricatives, and affricates.  Specifically, the larynx controls the vibration of the vocal folds, which generates voicing. Voicing refers to the vibration of the vocal folds that accompanies the production of most speech sounds in English and many other languages. For obstruents, the larynx controls whether voicing is present or absent, resulting in a contrast between voiced and voiceless consonant sounds.

In English, the voicing contrast between obstruents is phonemic, meaning it can change the meaning of words. For example, the words “bad” and “pad” differ only in the voicing of the initial consonant. When pronouncing “bad,” the vocal folds vibrate to produce voicing during the [b] sound. When pronouncing “pad,” the vocal folds remain still, producing a voiceless [p] sound. Although the oral articulation is identical between these words, the difference in laryngeal articulation results in a contrast in meaning.    

The fortis/lenis contrast refers to a phonetic categorization of obstruents in which fortis sounds are produced with greater articulatory force or constriction than lenis sounds. In English, the fortis/lenis contrast overlaps largely with the voiced/voiceless contrast. The voiceless stops [p, t, k] are considered fortis, while the voiced stops [b, d, g] are considered lenis. However, the relationship between voicing and consonant force is not straightforward. For some consonants, like [s] and [z], the voiceless consonant is actually produced with less articulatory force.   

There are several phonetic cues that English listeners use to perceive the voicing and fortis/lenis contrast in obstruents. The primary cue is the duration of voicing during the consonant. Voiced obstruents will typically have voicing for the entire duration of the consonant, while voiceless obstruents will lack voicing during the consonant. English listeners also use the relative intensity of voicing, with voiced obstruents having stronger voicing. Additional cues include the duration of the preceding vowel, the spectral qualities of frication noise, and phonetic context.  

In summary, the larynx controls the production of voicing that contrasts voiced and voiceless obstruents in English. This contrast is phonemic and corresponds largely to a fortis/lenis phonetic categorization. English listeners perceive this contrast using several phonetic cues, especially the duration and intensity of voicing during the consonant. The complex relationship between articulation, acoustics, and perception allows for a robust voicing contrast in English obstruents.
