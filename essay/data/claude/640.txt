Osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, causes pain and damage to joints, bones, and surrounding tissue by reducing the cushioning and lubrication in joints. In wheelchair-bound patients, osteoarthritis is especially problematic as mobility is already limited. 

The major symptoms of osteoarthritis in wheelchair-bound patients include joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. The joints most impacted are typically those that bear the most weight during movement and transfers, such as the knees, hips, hands, and spine. The pain tends to worsen over time and with activity. Patients may experience aching, sharp pains, or a grating sensation in the joints. Stiffness is common after periods of inactivity, such as sleeping or sitting. Joints may appear swollen or misshapen as the cartilage and bone deteriorate.

To diagnose osteoarthritis, physicians review medical history and symptoms, conduct a physical exam, and obtain imaging tests. During the physical exam, the physician checks for tenderness, pain, stiffness, swelling, range of motion, and joint instability. Commonly ordered tests include X-rays, which show narrowing of the joint space, bone spurs, and other changes to bones and cartilage. Blood tests help rule out other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. MRI or CT scans provide detailed images of damage to soft tissues and bones.

There are several steps wheelchair-bound patients can take to manage osteoarthritis. Exercise and physical therapy, especially range-of-motion and strengthening exercises, help keep joints flexible and muscles strong. Applying heat or ice, wearing splints or braces for support, and getting massage therapy may provide relief from pain. Over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen and NSAIDs reduce pain and inflammation. Corticosteroid injections can relieve pain in severe cases. 

For advanced osteoarthritis, joint replacement surgery may need to be considered to replace damaged joints. Following any treatments, occupational therapy can help improve mobility and teach adaptive techniques to optimize independence and quality of life. Managing other risks such as excess weight and injury prevention are also important.

In summary, osteoarthritis causes significant pain and disability in wheelchair-bound patients. Recognizing the symptoms, getting an accurate diagnosis, and pursuing appropriate conservative and surgical treatments and lifestyle changes can help wheelchair users achieve relief from this degenerative joint disease. Ongoing monitoring and support from physicians and therapists are key to optimal long term outcomes.
