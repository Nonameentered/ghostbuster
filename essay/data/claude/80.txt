Here is a draft 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

Discussions and debates around luxury have been prevalent for centuries, reflecting the social changes and anxieties of the time. In the eighteenth and late nineteenth centuries, the increasing access to luxury goods and the rising influence of women as consumers ignited contested debates over the proper role and nature of luxury. These historical debates continue to resonate today, as luxury remains a complex and often ambiguous concept in society.

In the eighteenth century, luxury was frequently portrayed as a threat to virtue and moral order. Critics argued that the pursuit of luxurious and conspicuous consumption would lead to indolence, corruption, and the decline of society. For example, political economist Adam Smith warned that the "trinkets of frivolous utility" and "baubles" of luxury would distract from productive labor and industry. However, others argued that luxury goods and commerce stimulated trade, employment, arts, and innovation. The increasing availability of luxury also reflected the improving standards of living for some. 

The rising power and influence of women as consumers of luxury further shaped these debates. Women were often the target of moralizing critiques that condemned indulgence in fashion and frivolity. However, new goods like tea, sugar, and china were also closely associated with feminine taste and domesticity. Women influenced luxury through their roles as purchasers and arbiters of taste, even as cultural critics attempted to limit their consumption. 

In the late nineteenth century, luxury remained a contested concept but the nature of debates began to shift. There was less outright condemnation of luxury but increasing anxiety over the pace of change and standards of taste. New forms of luxury like department stores that made goods more accessible to the middle class spurred concerns over emulation and the loss of exclusivity. However, luxury was also seen as a symbol of progress, taste, and refinement by some. The moral dichotomy between virtue and vice gave way to one between dependence and freedom. Luxury was a means of demonstrating one's liberated, cultured taste and independence from social constraints.

Today, these historical luxury debates persist but have evolved with modern society. Luxury is less associated with moral decline but continues to reflect societal ambivalence. It is portrayed as a symbol of status, taste, and empowerment but also excess and meaningless materialism.  Luxury remains closely connected to gender and sexuality, with feminine fashion and style frequently the subject of critique but also admiration. Like in the past, it is a concept shaped by both aspiration and indignation.

In conclusion, the debates around luxury that emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries remain highly relevant today. Ideas of luxury continue to be shaped by concerns over conspicuous display, the role of women, and the implications of changing consumption. Definitions of luxury also continue to signify broader societal changes, reflecting tensions between restraint and indulgence as well as shifts in taste and standards of living. While the specific arguments have evolved, luxury itself endures as a complex and ambiguous topic that exposes deep anxieties, values, and contradictions in society, just as in the past.
