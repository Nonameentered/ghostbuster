Here is a draft essay in about 1500 words:

Marx's conception of the capitalist social order centered around the idea of class conflict arising from the interdependent yet antagonistic relationship between the bourgeoisie, the owners of the means of production, and the proletariat, the workers who sell their labor. Marx argued that capitalism is an inherently contradictory system that necessitates the exploitation of the proletariat by the bourgeoisie in the process of capital accumulation and the generation of profit. These contradictions, such as the tendency of the rate of profit to fall, ultimately undermine the system and lead to its overthrow by the proletariat. 

Marx viewed the relationship between the capitalist and the worker as interdependent yet antagonistic. The capitalist relies on the labor of the worker to produce goods and generate profit, while the worker relies on the capitalist to provide employment and wages for survival. However, this relationship is antagonistic because the capitalist aims to maximize profit by exploiting the worker and extracting surplus value from the products of labor. The worker is alienated from the fruits of their labor and subjected to poor working conditions, long hours, and low wages that represent only a portion of the value they produce.

This antagonistic relationship gives rise to contradictions that threaten the stability of the capitalist system. One key contradiction is the tendency of the rate of profit to fall over time. As competition forces capitalists to invest in technology and streamline production to reduce costs, the proportion of variable capital (wages) to constant capital (technology, materials) decreases. Since only variable capital produces surplus value, the rate of profit falls, reducing the incentive for further investment. Falling profit rates can spur economic crises, declining production, and unemployment.

Marx's analysis of capitalism finds clear parallels in the modern phenomenon of globalization, particularly the spread of transnational corporations and the internationalization of production. The antagonistic bourgeoisie-proletariat relationship manifests in the separation of production from consumption around the world. Transnational companies exploit cheap labor in developing countries to produce goods for wealthy consumers in developed nations. Workers are subjected to harsh conditions and extremely low wages that maximize profit extraction for distant capitalists. 

At the same time, the internationalization of production has contributed to deindustrialization and job losses in developed countries as companies offshore manufacturing to reduce costs. This undermines the domestic proletariat in those nations and exacerbates inequality between the global bourgeoisie and the various international proletariats. The tendency of the rate of profit to fall also operates at a global scale, with competition driving the overall rate of return on capital down across borders. This spurs global crises, recession, and market turmoil that impact proletariats worldwide.

In conclusion, Marx's conception of the capitalist social order, grounded in the conflict between bourgeoisie and proletariat, remains highly relevant to understanding globalization and the internationalization of capital today. His analysis of capitalism's internal contradictions and crisis tendencies provide a theoretical framework for interpreting the instability and inequality that result from global competition and transnational production chains in the modern world system. Overall, Marx's ideas remain indispensable for grasping the dynamics of capitalism on a global scale.
