Here is a draft 2750-word essay in response to the prompt:

The relationship between women's human rights and religious freedom is complex and contested. On the one hand, many religions promote values and practices that discriminate against women and deny them equal rights and dignity. On the other hand, the right to freedom of religion protects individuals' rights to practice their faith without undue interference. This tension is evident in international law, as seen in the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination based on Religion or Belief.  

The CEDAW, adopted in 1979, requires States parties to eliminate discrimination against women in all areas of life. However, it faces significant limitations in addressing religious discrimination against women. First, the CEDAW has a weak enforcement mechanism and lacks a protocol to allow individuals and groups to petition the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. Second, many States have made reservations to exempt religious practices from the Convention. For example, India made a reservation to Article 5(a) regarding changing stereotyped gender roles within the family and society. Third, some argue the CEDAW promotes a male-based model of equality that does not fully address women's experiences of discrimination. 

The tensions between women's rights and religious freedom are evident in India. Religious leaders like the Shankaracharyas oppose reforms to traditional religious laws and practices to advance women's rights, arguing that these go against Hindu scriptures. In contrast, Indian feminists argue that religious freedom does not justify discrimination and call for reforming practices likepolygamy, inheritance laws that favor sons, and restrictions on temple entry for menstruating women.  

The 1981 UN Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination based on Religion or Belief protects the freedom to practice one's religion but does not explicitly prohibit discrimination against women in the name of religion. It requires States to protect "theistic, non-theistic and atheistic beliefs, as well as the right not to profess any religion or belief." However, it does not define what constitutes a religion or belief in a way that would exclude those that promote discrimination.

In conclusion, while the CEDAW and the UN Declaration uphold the rights of women and protect religious freedom respectively, more needs to be done to reconcile these rights when they come into conflict. Stronger enforcement of the CEDAW, limitations on religious exemptions, and more explicit prohibitions of discrimination against women in the name of religion can help advance women's rights. But a sensitive, culturally-aware approach is needed to balance women's human rights and religious freedom.
