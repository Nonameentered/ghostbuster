Acid-base titration is a practical analytical technique used to determine the total acidity or alkalinity of a liquid. It works by adding a base of known concentration to an acid of unknown concentration until neutralization occurs, as indicated by a change in color of an acid-base indicator. For vinegar, the titration is performed using sodium hydroxide as the basic titrant to determine the total acidity, which is expressed as acidity in terms of the equivalent amount of acetic acid. 

Vinegar contains acetic acid, which gives vinegar its acidic properties. By titrating vinegar with a basic solution of sodium hydroxide, the total acidity of the vinegar can be determined based on how much of the basic solution is required to neutralize the acetic acid in the vinegar. Sodium hydroxide is a strong base that fully dissociates in water into hydroxide ions. When added to an acidic solution like vinegar, the hydroxide ions neutralize the hydrogen ions from the acetic acid.

An acid-base indicator, such as phenolphthalein, is added to the vinegar before titrating with the sodium hydroxide. The indicator has a different color in acidic versus basic solutions. When the sodium hydroxide is first added, the vinegar remains acidic and the indicator maintains its acidic color. However, when enough sodium hydroxide has been added to neutralize all the hydrogen ions from the acetic acid, the solution becomes basic and the indicator changes color. This color change signals that neutralization has occurred. 

The sodium hydroxide solution is added to the vinegar from a burette, which is a long glass tube with graduated markings to precisely measure the volume of solution dispensed. By knowing the concentration and volume of the sodium hydroxide solution, the amount of acid in the vinegar can be quantitatively determined. For example, if 25 milliliters (mL) of 0.5 molar (M) NaOH are required to neutralize the indicator color change in 50 mL of vinegar, then the total acidity is 0.5 moles (mol) of acetic acid (the amount that would require 25 mL of 0.5M NaOH), or 30 grams (g) of acetic acid.  

In summary, acid-base titration uses a basic titrant to determine the total acidity of an acidic solution like vinegar. The amount of sodium hydroxide required for neutralization, as signaled by an indicator color change, can be used to calculate the concentration of acetic acid in the vinegar. Precise addition and measurement of reagents is key to an accurate determination of acidity. With some simple calculations, the total acidity of vinegar can be expressed as a concentration of acetic acid in grams per liter.
