There are several aspects of Plato's ideal state in The Republic that can be characterized as elitist:

1. The selection of Philosopher Kings and the Guardian class. Plato proposes a rigorous education and selection process to identify the best and most virtuous to rule the state. Only a select few who demonstrate the proper devotion to justice and the forms can become Philosopher Kings. This is an explicitly elitist model that concentrates power and authority in a small group of uniquely qualified individuals.

2. The eugenic breeding program. Plato proposes breeding the Philosopher Kings and Guardians through a program of eugenics to produce the best offspring. The best men and women will be bred together based on their virtuous natures. This selective breeding to produce a superior ruling class is a notably elitist idea. 

3. The strict hierarchy. Plato's state has a rigid hierarchy with the Philosopher Kings at the top, followed by the Guardians, then the masses. There is little social mobility. One's place in the hierarchy is determined by one's nature, virtues, and abilities. This strict and fixed social hierarchy is characteristic of an elitist structure.

4. The concentration of power and autonomy in the Philosopher Kings. The rulers have significant control and authority over the state and the lives of the people. The masses have little say in governance and are expected to trust the wisdom and judgment of the Philosopher Kings. This concentration of power in a small elite group is a hallmark of elitism.

In conclusion, while Plato's ideal state does have some meritocratic elements, especially in the education and selection of the Philosopher Kings, there are several clearly elitist aspects including the breeding program, strict social hierarchy, and concentration of power. So on balance, Plato's proposed state can rightly be characterized as elitist based on these attributes and structure. The elitism is not without reason or logic in Plato's view, but it is elitism nonetheless.
