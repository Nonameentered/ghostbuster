Surfactants are compounds that contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups. They play a crucial role in emulsions to stabilize immiscible water and oil phases. Surfactants adsorb at the water-oil interface and reduce interfacial tension, facilitating formation and stabilization of droplets. 

Different types of surfactants vary in their effectiveness to stabilize emulsions. Nonionic surfactants, with no charge groups, are generally good emulsifiers as they are compatible with both water and oil. However, ionic surfactants may also be good emulsifiers if used at proper ratios of anionic to cationic or in combination with nonionic surfactants. Zwitterionic surfactants can provide stability to both anionic and cationic emulsions. In general, emulsions stabilized by nonionic surfactants tend to appear the most translucent due to minimal droplet flocculation. 

The hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value indicates the degree of hydrophilicity or lipophilicity of a surfactant. For oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions, surfactants with HLB greater than 10 are suitable, while for water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions, those with HLB less than 10 are preferred. To create water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double emulsions, a combination of high and low HLB surfactants are required - the high HLB surfactant stabilizes the inner water droplets and the low HLB surfactant stabilizes the outer water phase. The proper ratio of the two surfactants is important to achieve maximum stability.

Using a combination of two or more surfactants with different properties can improve emulsion stability through synergistic effects. Mixtures of ionic and nonionic surfactants, or mixtures of surfactants with different chain lengths and saturations, are common strategies. For example, the combination of a nonionic surfactant (for steric stabilization) and an ionic surfactant (for charge stabilization) can produce very stable emulsions. With multiple surfactants, there are more opportunities for the surfactants to position at the interface with orientations that minimize droplet flocculation and coalescence.

In summary, surfactants are essential for creating and stabilizing emulsions. They facilitate emulsion formation by lowering interfacial tension and provide stability through mechanisms like steric hindrance and charge repulsion. The type, HLB value, concentration ratio and combinations of surfactants can significantly impact the stability and appearance of emulsions. By optimizing these factors, highly stable simple and double emulsions can be achieved.
