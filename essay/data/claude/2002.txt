Here is a draft 500 word essay in response to the prompt:

There are significant differences between how children learn spoken language and how they are taught to read and write. Spoken language is acquired naturally and implicitly through interaction and exposure, while reading and writing are learned through explicit instruction. 

Children pick up spoken language simply by hearing it spoken around them from a very early age. They are immersed in the sounds and patterns of the language, and over time they come to mimic those sounds and understand the meanings and rules behind them. This process happens implicitly, without direct teaching. Children do not need to be formally taught the rules of grammar or pronunciation to become fluent speakers. They learn through exposure and interaction, with sensitivity to context and a natural ability to detect patterns.

In contrast, reading and writing are skills that have to be taught directly. Children are not born with an innate ability to read or write. They must be taught the relationship between letters and sounds, the rules of spelling, grammar, and punctuation, and how to decode text. This requires intentional and explicit instruction, through activities like phonics lessons, spelling tests, readings, and writing assignments. While children learn to speak in a very natural way, learning to read and write is a much more deliberate and labor-intensive process that requires considerable time and educational support.  

In conclusion, the key difference comes down to implicit versus explicit learning. Spoken language develops naturally through immersion and interaction, while reading and writing depend on direct and systematic teaching. Both forms of learning are crucial for children to become fully literate and expressive, even if the processes by which they are acquired differ substantially. Understanding these differences can help educators develop stronger curriculum and set appropriate expectations for students as they learn these fundamental skills.
