Error theory in meta-ethics is the view that all moral judgments are false. According to error theory, moral judgments aim to assert or represent moral facts, but there are no moral facts to be represented. Error theorists argue that there are no objective moral properties or values in the world. This contrasts with non-naturalist moral realism, which holds that there are objective moral facts that are not reducible to natural facts. Non-naturalists believe moral properties are sui generis and can be known through intuition or reason alone. 

J.L. Mackie provides two main arguments for error theory: the argument from relativity and the argument from queerness. The argument from relativity points out that moral judgments seem to vary greatly across cultures and individuals, whereas we would expect objective moral facts to be consistent and universal. For example, practices like honor killing and female genital mutilation are considered morally acceptable in some cultures but condemned in others. Moral intuitions also seem to depend heavily on upbringing and life experiences. Mackie argues this variability suggests there are no objective moral facts.

Mackie's argument from queerness claims that objective moral properties would have to be very strange kinds of things, utterly unlike anything in the natural world. They would have to be intrinsically motivating or action-guiding, but also objective and mind-independent. Mackie argues we have no reason to believe such queer properties exist. They would be metaphysically dubious, and we cannot explain how we could come to have knowledge of them. So, we should reject belief in objective moral facts.

Moderate error theory attempts to address the implausible view that all moral judgments are strictly false. Moderate error theorists argue some moral judgments could be "superassertible" - not true in a robust sense but still pragmatically useful and warranting assertibility. Crispin Wright argues a judgment is superassertible if it is presupposed by our practices of moral reasoning and discourse in a way that shapes how we think and live. So, moderate error theory could allow for moral judgments that serve certain practical and social functions, even if lacking a truth value.

However, critics argue moderate error theory faces serious problems. Alexander Miller argues that a moral judgment lacking a truth value cannot fulfill the directive and action-guiding purposes we expect of moral judgments. Moral judgments aim to direct behavior and guide moral decisions, but they can only do so if asserting moral facts. Merely superassertible judgments would not suffice. Moderate error theory also fails to match our intuitions about moral truth and the semantics of moral language. When we make moral claims, we aim to assert moral facts. Moderate error theory cannot accommodate this.

In conclusion, error theory holds that there are no objective moral truths, though moderate versions aim to show some moral judgments could still be pragmatically justified. However, error theory faces compelling objections, and more work is needed to determine if any version of it can be plausibly defended. Non-naturalist moral realism remains a more intuitively appealing view that takes moral judgments at face value as aiming to assert objective moral facts.
