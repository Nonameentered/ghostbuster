Here is a draft 1470 word essay in response to the prompt:

The body requires energy to perform essential functions and processes to sustain life. Adenosine triphosphate or ATP is the main energy currency of cells. There are several sources of energy that can be used to synthesise ATP:

Firstly, glucose obtained from the diet or glycogen stores can be used as an energy source. Glucose is broken down through a metabolic pathway called glycolysis which yields 2 molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose. The end product of glycolysis then enters the mitochondria where it is further oxidised in the Krebs cycle, generating more ATP. The reduced coenzymes from the Krebs cycle enter the electron transport chain to generate the most amount of ATP, around 32 molecules per glucose molecule. 

Fat obtained from the diet or fat stores in the body can also be used to generate ATP. Fatty acids undergo beta-oxidation in the mitochondria, yielding acetyl-CoA which then enters the Krebs cycle. The reduced coenzymes from beta-oxidation and the Krebs cycle enter the electron transport chain to generate ATP. Fat yields the most amount of ATP per gram compared to other energy sources.

Proteins from the diet or muscles can be broken down into amino acids. The amino acids can enter the Krebs cycle directly or after being converted into Krebs cycle intermediates like pyruvate and Acetyl-CoA. This results in the synthesis of ATP from the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain. However, proteins are not an optimal source of energy and are usually spared for other functions. 

Another source is ketone bodies, synthesised in the liver from fatty acids during starvation or low carbohydrate conditions. The ketone bodies can be used to generate ATP in tissues like the brain. They enter the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain to generate ATP in a similar fashion as other energy sources.

Glycogen is a storage form of glucose in the body. It is a multi-branched polysaccharide stored mainly in the liver and muscles. In times of energy need, glycogen can be mobilised rapidly to supply glucose. Glycogen is broken down through a process called glycogenolysis. It involves the cleavage of the branched polysaccharide into its constituent glucose molecules.

The breakdown of glycogen starts from the non-reducing end of glycogen with the removal of a glucose molecule by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase to yield glucose-1-phosphate. This is then converted into glucose-6-phosphate which can enter glycolysis and subsequent metabolic pathways to generate ATP or be dephosphorylated into glucose and released into the bloodstream. Branching enzymes are necessary to break down the branches of glycogen into smaller polysaccharides that can be further metabolised by glycogen phosphorylase.

In summary, there are several energy sources available in the body to synthesise ATP including glucose, fat, proteins and ketone bodies. Glycogen acts as a storage form of glucose that can be readily mobilised through the process of glycogenolysis to yield glucose molecules and ATP. Glycogen phosphorylase and debranching enzymes break down glycogen into glucose to supply energy to cells.
