Grazing pressure from herbivores, both domesticated and wild, can have varying effects on different habitat types in Britain. Upland moorlands, lowland heathlands, lowland deciduous forests, and grasslands each have unique plant communities that are adapted to particular levels of grazing. Both overgrazing and undergrazing can be detrimental to biodiversity in these ecosystems. 

On upland moorlands, moderate grazing by sheep and other herbivores helps maintain an open habitat structure preferred by many bird species. However, overgrazing reduces vegetation cover and can lead to soil erosion, damaging plant communities. Undergrazing allows shrubs and trees to encroach on moorlands, destroying the open habitat. For biodiversity conservation, sustainable levels of grazing are needed to preserve the characteristic plant species of moorlands, like heather, bilberry, and mosses.

Lowland heathlands are also adapted to light grazing pressure but are more sensitive to the impacts of overgrazing. The nutrient-poor soils support species like heather, gorse, and rare plants such as sundews and orchids. Overgrazing removes vegetation, exposes bare ground, and allows invasive species to colonize the habitat. No grazing leads the heathland to succeed into scrub and woodland, reducing biodiversity. Management often involves removing grazing in small patches to diversify the habitat structure, but overall light levels of grazing are still needed to maintain the heathland.

In contrast, lowland deciduous forests have evolved with minimal grazing pressure. While they can sustain light, periodic grazing, too much grazing pressure prevents saplings and understory plants from becoming established, damaging forest regeneration and diversity. No grazing allows the understory and midstory to become dense, shading out light-dependent plants. For conservation, most deciduous forests are left ungrazed or only lightly grazed to enable natural ecological succession and support the maximum biodiversity.

Finally, semi-natural grasslands require moderate levels of grazing to prevent domination by competitive plant species, support rare plants, and maintain an open sward structure. However, overgrazing can deteriorate the sward, encouraging weedy species and reducing biodiversity. Undergrazing allows grasslands to become rank, shading out light-dependent species. Sustainable grazing levels vary based on soil fertility and other factors but aim to encourage a diversity of grasses and forbs in the sward. 

In summary, the effects of grazing on British habitats depend on the natural level of grazing to which the plant communities are adapted. While grazing is an important management tool for biodiversity conservation, sustainable levels must be carefully calibrated for each habitat to balance the risks of overgrazing versus undergrazing. Overall, moderate levels of grazing tend to support the highest diversity of species, but this varies for upland moorlands, lowland heathlands, deciduous forests, and grasslands.
