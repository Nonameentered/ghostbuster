The Ottoman Empire began declining in the 17th century and its fall in the early 20th century was the result of a myriad of factors. The European discovery of new trade routes around Africa and across the Atlantic greatly reduced the Ottoman monopoly over transit trade between Europe and Asia. However, the loss of this trade alone should not be considered the primary cause for the Ottoman decline. There were several other significant reasons for the weakening and eventual collapse of the once powerful Ottoman state.  

Firstly, the Ottoman military underwent a deterioration in its capabilities and effectiveness over time. The elite Janissary corps had become increasingly difficult to discipline and its technology and tactics were outdated. The Ottoman navy also declined, giving European rivals key advantages in naval warfare and trade. The failed Sieges of Vienna in 1529 and 1683 were symbolic of the Ottomans' declining military might. Without maintaining a strong army and navy, the Ottomans could not effectively control their territory or project power abroad.

Secondly, the Ottoman state suffered from administrative and bureaucratic inefficiencies that hindered its ability to govern such a large empire. The devshirme system of child levies for the military and administration broke down over time. Opportunities for advancement in the Ottoman system largely depended on personal connections and status rather than merit. Corruption became rampant, tax collection was ineffective, and excessive government spending on the military and Janissaries strained state coffers. These issues significantly weakened the Ottoman central administration.   

Thirdly, the Ottomans failed to keep up with political and social changes that were transforming Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The Enlightenment and religious reforms of the Renaissance passed the Ottoman Empire by. The Ottomans tolerated little political dissent or challenges to their authority, stifling political and social progress. They also mostly isolated themselves from European affairs and innovations. While the Europeans were establishing new colonial empires and industrializing, the Ottomans were struggling with maintaining the territory they already controlled.  

In conclusion, although the European discovery of new trade routes dealt a blow to a key Ottoman economic advantage, it was not solely responsible for the decline and fall of the empire. Military deterioration, administrative inefficiencies, political stagnation, and social rigidity all played equally significant roles in the weakening of Ottoman power over the course of centuries. The loss of European transit trade exacerbated these issues but should not be seen as the primary cause for the downfall of the once mighty Ottoman Empire. Overall, it was the failure of the Ottomans to reform and keep pace with a changing world that led to their inevitable imperial decline.
