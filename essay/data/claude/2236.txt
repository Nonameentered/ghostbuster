The Scientific Evidence for an Expanding Universe

The expanding universe theory, also known as the Big Bang theory, is supported by several lines of evidence from astronomy and physics. The first evidence for an expanding universe came from observational astronomy in the 1920s. Edwin Hubble observed that galaxies outside our own Milky Way galaxy appeared to be moving away from us. Not only that, but the more distant the galaxy, the faster its apparent motion. This relationship between a galaxy's distance and its speed away from us became known as Hubble's law. 

Hubble observed this phenomenon by measuring the redshifts of light from galaxies. When an object in space moves away from us, the light it emits is stretched out. This is known as the Doppler effect, and it causes the light to shift toward the red end of the spectrum. By measuring a galaxy's redshift, Hubble could calculate how fast it is moving away from us. The only explanation for Hubble's observation that all galaxies seem to be moving away from us is that the universe itself is expanding. The space between galaxies is stretching, causing them to become more distant over time.

Additional evidence for the expanding universe comes from observing the cosmic microwave background, or CMB. The CMB is radiation that permeates the entire universe and is left over from just after the Big Bang. Scientists observe that the CMB is mostly uniform, but it does have tiny fluctuations in energy and temperature. These fluctuations indicate some parts of the early universe were slightly more dense. As the universe has expanded over 13.8 billion years, these density fluctuations have grown into the large-scale structure in the universe, including galaxies and galaxy clusters. By measuring the CMB, we see direct evidence for a hotter, denser early universe that has expanded and cooled over cosmic time.

Yet more evidence comes from the abundances of light elements like hydrogen, helium, and lithium in the universe. According to the Big Bang theory, the early universe was a sea of elementary particles that fused together to form the first elements. Calculations based on the expansion rate and cooling of the universe as predicted in the Big Bang theory closely match the measured amounts of hydrogen, helium, lithium, and other light elements. This is a key success of the Big Bang theory and confirms its picture of an early, hot dense state transitioning into an expanding and cooling universe.

In summary, observations of the redshifts of galaxies, the uniformity and fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background, and the abundances of light elements all point to the same conclusion: that the universe began roughly 14 billion years ago in an extremely hot and dense state and has been expanding and cooling ever since. Together, these multiple lines of scientific evidence support the theory of an expanding universe arising from the Big Bang.
