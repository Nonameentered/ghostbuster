The Materials Testing Laboratory plays a crucial role in biomedical materials science. Its purpose is to test candidate materials for potential use inside the human body, typically for medical implants like hip replacements or dental plates. The experiments conducted in the laboratory evaluate how materials interact with biological systems to determine if they are biocompatible and suitable for implantation in humans.  

Experiments conducted in the Materials Testing Laboratory include cytotoxicity testing, genetic toxicity testing, implantation testing in animals, and mechanical testing. Cytotoxicity testing examines how the material impacts the viability and functioning of human cells. Typically, researchers culture cells and expose them to extracts from the material to check for changes in cell morphology, growth, and functionality. Genetic toxicity testing determines if the material induces any DNA damage or mutations when cells are exposed to it. Implantation testing involves placing samples of the material within living tissues of animals like rodents to see how the material impacts the surrounding cells and fluids over time. Mechanical testing evaluates the material's strength, durability, and stability within a physiological environment.

The results from these experiments are essential for evaluating if a material can be safely and effectively used within the human body. If a material shows cytotoxic effects, DNA damage, or adverse tissue reactions in animals, it is likely not suitable as a biomedical implant. The material must be non-toxic, non-mutagenic, non-carcinogenic and elicit little to no immune or inflammatory response upon implantation. It also needs to have adequate mechanical and physical properties to withstand forces within the body without breaking down or degrading too quickly. Materials that pass the necessary biocompatibility and performance testing can then be approved for clinical trials and potential commercial use in medical implants.

In summary, the Materials Testing Laboratory plays an integral role in determining which materials can be viably used as biomedical implants in humans. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, researchers can evaluate biocompatibility and performance to assess safety risks and functionality before the material is implanted within a patient. Successful testing and approval of new materials spurs continued innovation in biomedical materials science and results in improved medical implants and devices to enhance quality of life.
