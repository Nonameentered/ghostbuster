Acemoglu and Robinson's theoretical model explores how elites may become repressive to maintain their power and when revolutions by the masses are more likely. According to their model, when societies experience a contraction in economic opportunities and social mobility, the elites are more prone to become repressive to protect their privileges. They will restrict economic opportunities and political participation for the general population. This makes the society more extractive. In contrast, when there are expanding economic opportunities and social mobility, the elites are willing to grant more political and economic rights and liberties to the citizens, making the society more inclusive.  

Under what conditions is a revolution of the masses more likely? Acemoglu and Robinson argue that revolutions are more likely when repressive elites close off opportunities for upward mobility and gain for the masses. When the elites extract too much from the majority of the population and deny them meaningful political participation or economic gains, they are sowing the seeds for potential revolution. The masses have little to lose and much to gain by staging a revolt against the repressive system. Revolutions are more likely in long-established extractive societies where the contradictions between repressive regimes and demands for more inclusion have intensified over time. Of course, simply having a large class of discontented citizens is not enough—they also need to be coordinated and able to overcome the coercive power of the state. But when revolutions do come, they aim to switch the system from being narrow-based and extractive to being more inclusive by overthrowing the existing power structures.

How well does this theory apply to historical and current democratization experiences? Acemoglu and Robinson apply their theory to explain many major historical revolutions, including the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution. In both cases, they argue the existing elites had become highly repressive, closing off opportunity and mobility for the masses. This bred deep resentment and ultimately popular uprisings that overthrew the existing monarchical regimes. Their theory also applies to many contemporary transitions to democracy. In South Africa, for example, the repressive apartheid regime had extracted political and economic opportunity from the black majority for decades until a revolutionary shift took place in the early 1990s. In South Korea, students and workers revolted against the repressive military regime in the 1980s and ushered in a transition to democracy. In Ukraine's Maidan revolution of 2014, protesters demanded an end to government corruption and closer ties to the EU—aiming to shift Ukraine from a repressive regime to a more open democratic system with closer links to the West.

In conclusion, Acemoglu and Robinson provide a compelling theory for why some elites become repressive while others are more willing to open up their societies. They highlight how expanding opportunity and mobility tend to breed more inclusive systems while contraction of opportunity fuels extractive regimes. Their theory also helps explain why revolutions emerge in some repressive societies but not others. By looking at both historical and contemporary examples, we see the broad applicability of their theoretical model to democratization experiences around the world. Overall, they make a persuasive case for why institutions that open up opportunity tend to lead to more stable, democratic societies.
