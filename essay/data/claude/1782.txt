Changes in Fish Protein During Storage: Methods and Outcomes

Fish is a popular food item around the world, as it is a good source of high-quality protein as well as healthy fatty acids. However, fish protein is highly perishable, and it deteriorates quickly after death due to enzymatic and microbial spoilage. To better understand the changes in fish protein during storage and to determine optimal storage conditions and maximum shelf life, researchers have studied how fish protein breaks down over time and in different storage environments.  

One common method used to analyze changes in fish protein during storage is sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This technique separates proteins based on their molecular weight. By extracting protein from fish samples during storage and comparing the protein profiles over time using SDS-PAGE, researchers can observe the breakdown of major proteins into smaller peptides and amino acids. For example, one study found that after 6 days of ice storage, the intensities of major protein bands from Nile perch decreased by 60-80%, indicating substantial protein degradation.  

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is another technique used to examine changes in amino acid composition of fish protein during storage. In one study, researchers analyzed amino acid content of hybrid striped bass fillets every 2-3 days during storage at 4Â°C for 18 days. They found that histidine, lysine, arginine, and aromatic amino acids decreased the most during the first 9-12 days of storage. The degradation of certain amino acids can impact the nutritional quality, flavor, and texture of fish.    

Using these analytical methods, researchers have found that fish protein deteriorates rapidly during the first week of ice storage, especially for fatty fish species. Protein degradation leads to loss of nutrition, development of off-flavors, and softening of flesh. Storage temperature is an important factor, with lower temperatures slowing down protein breakdown. Other factors such as fish species, catching method, and initial microbial load also influence the rate of protein degradation.

In summary, techniques like SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and HPLC are commonly used to examine how fish protein changes during various storage conditions and durations. Researchers have found that fish protein breaks down quickly within the first week of storage, especially at higher temperatures. Their findings have provided insights into optimal chilling conditions and shelf lives to minimize protein degradation and maintain the quality of fish. Overall, the ability to analyze how fish protein changes during storage has many practical applications for the seafood industry.
