Here is a draft 2250-word essay in response to the prompt:

The realist critique of liberal internationalism is ambiguous and incomplete due to the extent to which realism has borrowed core liberal assumptions. Realism rejects liberalism's focus on ideas, morality, and cooperation as the basis for international order, instead emphasizing power, self-interest, and competition between states as the driving forces of world politics. However, in developing their theoretical perspective and in analyzing history, realists have implicitly relied on liberal concepts of common interests, moral purpose, and the possibility of cooperation. 

Realism emerged in opposition to liberal internationalism in the aftermath of World War 1. Liberals believed that the war represented the failure of the old order of competitive power politics between states. They argued that a new international society based on cooperation, multilateralism and shared moral purpose was necessary to achieve lasting peace. Realists like E.H. Carr and Hans Morgenthau rejected this view, arguing that power, not morality, shapes world politics. They saw cooperation as epiphenomenal, arising only when it serves the self-interested power goals of states.

However, in articulating their critique of liberalism, realists relied on the implicit assumption that states can share common interests and cooperate. Carr noted that a harmony of interests was possible between satisfied powers, while Morgenthau saw cooperation arising from a “convergence of self-interested power moves.” Their arguments also hinted at a moral vision of stability and moderation in international politics. Morgenthau's concept of the “balance of power” implied moral restraint in state behavior to preserve the system. By relying on these liberal concepts, the realist perspective lacked a logically coherent and comprehensive challenge to liberal internationalism.

In the decades after World War 2, realism dominated International Relations theory and the realist perspective seemed to describe well the dynamics of competition and tension, e.g. the Cold War. However, in the post-Cold War era, realism struggled to explain increasing cooperation on global issues like the environment, health, and trade. While realists saw this as ephemeral, liberals argued it reflected the rise of global moral purpose and shared interests. 

Prominent realists responded by revising realism to better incorporate liberal concepts of cooperation. John Mearsheimer's “offensive realism” argued that states do cooperate when their self-interested power goals align. Kenneth Waltz's “neoclassical realism” focused on how leaders' misperceptions and poor foreign policy choices, not just the international system, cause conflict. These revised theories implicitly relied on ideas of shared interests and the human element in politics which realism originally downplayed - revealing the ambiguity at the heart of the realist perspective.

In conclusion, while realism emerged as a critique of liberal internationalism, it has throughout its history implicitly relied on core liberal concepts like cooperation, morality and common interests. Realism's rejection of these concepts has tended to rely more on rhetoric rather than substantive arguments, leaving its critique of liberalism conceptually ambiguous and open to question. The development of realism in many ways reflects the underlying questions around interests, ethics, and human nature which shape the First Debate of International Relations. A coherent and compelling realist perspective must resolve these questions and deepen its challenge to liberalism. Overall, there is space to reconcile these theoretical traditions to advance knowledge about world politics.
