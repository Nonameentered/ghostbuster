The Charpy impact test is a standardized test used to measure the toughness of materials. It involves striking a notched sample of the material with a weighted pendulum to determine the amount of energy absorbed during fracture, which is a measure of the material's toughness. The test can be conducted at different temperatures to determine the ductile-brittle transition temperature of a material, which is the temperature at which it transitions from ductile fracture behavior to brittle fracture behavior.

For steels, several factors affect the toughness and ductile-brittle transition temperature, including carbon content, heat treatment, and test temperature. In general, higher carbon content reduces toughness and lowers the transition temperature because carbon stabilizes the brittle body-centered cubic ferrite phase. Heat treatments like quenching and tempering can improve toughness by producing a microstructure of tempered martensite. Lower test temperatures also reduce toughness since materials become more brittle at lower temperatures. 

Charpy testing of various steels shows that at higher temperatures, all steels absorb a large amount of energy due to their ductile behavior, indicating high toughness. However, at lower temperatures, high-carbon steels reach their transition points at a higher temperature than low-carbon steels, indicating that high-carbon steels become brittle sooner upon cooling. The transition range can span a range of temperatures, suggesting a mixed microstructure of ferrite, pearlite, bainite or martensite based on the steel's exact composition and processing.

This analysis of steels via Charpy testing allows designers to choose appropriate materials for specific applications and operating temperatures. For applications requiring high toughness at lower temperatures, low-carbon steels would be preferable since their transition temperature is lower. If a higher strength is needed, designers can select a higher carbon steel and apply heat treatments to improve its toughness. The Charpy test also provides an easy method to compare different materials and different processing techniques in order to optimize for the best combination of mechanical properties.

In summary, the Charpy impact test is a useful way to characterize the toughness and ductile-brittle transition behavior of steels with different carbon contents and heat treatments. By generating curves of impact energy vs temperature, it provides designers the information needed to select the most suitable materials for applications requiring a balance of strength and toughness at various operating temperatures. Careful control of composition, microstructure, and temperature thus allows tuning the properties of steel for optimal performance.
