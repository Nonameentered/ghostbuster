Assess the impact of British rule on India's economy during the colonial period 

British rule in India lasted from 1858 to 1947, spanning nearly 90 years during which India was a colony under the British Raj. The economic impact of British colonial rule on India was substantial and mainly negative. Overall, India's economy experienced deindustrialization, increased reliance on agriculture, neglect of agriculture, economic exploitation, and dislocation from global trade networks during two centuries of British dominance.

Britain pursued a deliberate policy of deindustrialization in India during the colonial period. They systematically dismantled India's domestic manufacturing industries like textiles and shipbuilding, and prevented the development of new industries like rail equipment manufacturing. India's share of global industrial production declined from 27% to 2% between 1750 and 1900, as domestic artisans and small-scale tradesmen were put out of business. India became a source of raw materials and agricultural products for British manufacturers, with the East India Company using India as a source of raw cotton, silk, indigo, and opium to fuel British textile and trade industries. This deindustrialization dealt a blow to India's economic vitality and led to a sharp drop in the standard of living for industrial workers and craftsmen.

Under British rule, India's economy became increasingly dependent on agriculture. Nearly 85-90% of Indians were employed in agriculture during the colonial era. However, the agricultural sector suffered from neglect, lack of investment, heavy taxation, and rack-renting by British planters. Famine was a regular occurrence, with major famines in Bihar in 1770, in the Deccan in 1800, and in Bengal in 1943 which each caused millions of deaths. Irrigation systems and agricultural infrastructure were not improved, and Indian farmers faced ever-increasing taxation and rent demands from British landowners which impoverished the peasantry. The agricultural economy was deliberately kept underdeveloped to create markets for British manufactured goods.  

Economic exploitation was a hallmark of British rule in India. The British extracted enormous wealth from India through taxation, plunder, exports, and administrative costs while investing little in economic or social development. The excess revenues were used to finance Britain's trade and military costs around the world. British taxation was very high relative to other colonies, at around 50% of the annual national income during the mid-19th century. This heavy taxation severely limited the ability of Indian businesses and farmers to accumulate capital for investment. Revenue from taxes also financed the high salaries and pensions of British civil servants and soldiers in India. Some have estimated that Britain drained nearly $45 trillion from India between 1765 and 1938 in present-day dollars.

British rule also resulted in India being dislocated from major global trade networks. Before the colonial era, India exported high-value manufactured goods like textiles, spices, handicrafts throughout Asia, the Middle East and even Europe. But under the British, India was relegated to being a supplier of raw materials and agricultural produce. Indian traders and merchants were pushed aside in favor of British interests. India's balance of trade moved from surplus to deficit, as the value of imports exceeded exports. Only British ships and companies were allowed to engage in trade to and from India, hurting India's ability to trade with its historical partners and to benefit from thriving Indian Ocean trade networks.  

In conclusion, British colonial rule had a disastrous impact on India's economy. It led to deindustrialization, an over-reliance on agriculture, economic exploitation, and isolation from global trade. The historical legacy of two centuries of British rule continues to haunt India's economy today through enduring structural weaknesses. Removing India from the global economy and deliberately underdeveloping its industries and agriculture for British gain severely handicapped India's economic potential and self-sufficiency. British colonial policies were designed to benefit Britain at the expense of Indian development, resulting in lasting economic challenges that India still grapples with today.
