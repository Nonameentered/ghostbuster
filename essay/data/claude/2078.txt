Here is a draft essay in roughly 1500 words on consumer concerns over genetically modified organisms in food production:

Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have been used increasingly in agriculture and food production over the past few decades. GMOs refer to plants, animals, or microorganisms that have had their genetic code altered through biotechnology, often by adding DNA from other organisms. While proponents argue that GMOs increase crop yields, improve nutrition, and confer other benefits, many consumers remain concerned about their safety and long-term effects, especially in the production of food.  

On the one hand, GMOs have the potential to help address some critical issues in global food production. By inserting drought-resistant or pest-resistant genes into crops, GMOs can help improve agricultural productivity and yields, especially in developing countries. GMOs can also be nutritionally enhanced by adding nutrients like Vitamin A to foods. Proponents argue that GMOs are thoroughly tested and regulated to ensure safety and that there is a scientific consensus on their safety for human consumption according to major scientific institutions.  

However, many consumers remain skeptical about the benefits and concerned about the risks of GMOs, especially in food. One concern is that GMOs may have unforeseen effects on human health, especially given how recently they have been introduced into the food system. Although most studies have found GMOs to be safe to eat, some studies have linked them to issues like allergic reactions or toxicity. Another concern is that GMOs may have environmental impacts, such as the development of herbicide-resistant weeds or cross-pollination with wild plants. There is also a concern that GMOs benefit large biotechnology companies rather than smallholder farmers and sustainable food systems.  

While the benefits of GMOs for food production are significant and opinions on both sides vary widely, consumer concerns over their use seem to be justified given the number of open questions. More extensive, long-term studies on the effects of GMOs on both human health and the environment are still needed to adequately assess safety, especially with new varieties and traits constantly in development. Strict regulation and proper labeling of GMOs may also help address consumer concerns by increasing transparency. Overall, a balanced, evidence-based discussion on this issue would benefit both public opinion and future policymaking regarding this issue.

In summary, this essay outlines some of the main concerns that consumers have regarding the use of GMOs in food production, including health risks, environmental impacts, and ethical issues. The essay argues that while GMOs may have benefits, consumer concerns seem justified given open questions about their long-term effects and a lack of consensus on current evidence. More research and discussion are needed to adequately address these concerns. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this essay further.
