The article "Fertility, education and development: Evidence from India" by Jean Dreze and Mamta Murthi investigates the relationship between female education, fertility, and development in the Indian states. The authors examine how female autonomy, income, infant mortality and other factors influence fertility rates across 16 major states in India between 1971 to 1998.  

The study investigates the education-fertility relationship through regression analysis using state-level panel data. The main findings are that female literacy and education have a significant negative impact on fertility. The authors estimate that an increase of 10 percentage points in female literacy could decrease fertility by 0.27 births per woman. They also find that women's autonomy, as measured by the sex ratio and the percentage of women engaged in paid work, has a negative effect on fertility. Infant mortality rate and per capita income are also negatively associated with fertility, though the effects are not always significant.

There are some potential limitations to the methodology. First, the analysis is done at an aggregated state level, so it is difficult to draw conclusions at an individual level due to ecological fallacy. Second, the study only looks at a snapshot in time, so it is hard to establish causality between the variables. Reverse causality is possible, where high fertility could in turn affect female education and autonomy. Panel data analysis helps address this but does not solve the problem entirely. 

To improve the methodology, the authors could conduct multi-level analysis using individual and household data in addition to state-level data. They could also employ more advanced panel data techniques such as fixed effects model to help establish causality. Conducting the analysis over multiple time periods using a longer panel would strengthen the results.

The findings of the study contribute to the literature on population growth and development by providing evidence from India, an important developing country. The study highlights the key role of female education and empowerment in curbing high birth rates. It shows how factors like income, infant mortality and women's status interact in a developing country context to influence demographic outcomes. The insights could help inform population policies and programs aiming to facilitate the demographic transition in India and other developing nations.

Overall, the study by Dreze and Murthi makes a valuable contribution in understanding the drivers of high fertility in developing countries like India. However, the methodology could be strengthened using individual-level data and more advanced econometric techniques. Expanding the scope of the analysis to other developing countries could also help increase the generalizability of the findings. With improvements, this line of research could provide very useful insights for policymakers and governments seeking to accelerate fertility decline and promote sustainable development.
