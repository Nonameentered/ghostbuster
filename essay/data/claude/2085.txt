Here is a 954-word essay in response to the prompt:

Connectionist models have been proposed as an alternative to the rule-based approach in explaining morphological development and the acquisition of inflectional rules in children. Connectionism adopts a single mechanism approach centered around neural network models to account for the learning of inflectional morphology. In contrast, the traditional approach proposes that children acquire morphological rules and apply them productively to form inflected words. This essay will evaluate the success of connectionist models in accounting for empirical data on the acquisition of English past tense morphology, comparing it to the rule-based approach.  

A key debate concerns whether connectionist models can capture the U-shaped development in children's production of overregularized forms like 'goed' and 'comed.' Connectionist models can simulate this pattern by initially learning associative mappings between verbs and their past tense forms. As the model is exposed to more data, it abstracts away from specific word-to-word mappings to capture the regularity in the language, leading to decreased use of overregularizations. This shows that connectionist models can successfully capture U-shaped development in a way consistent with empirical data.

However, connectionist models struggle to account for children's ability to productively apply inflectional rules to novel words. The single mechanism approach operates using statistical learning from the language environment, making it difficult to extend learning to new words. In contrast, the rule-based approach proposes that children can extract symbolic rules like 'add -ed to make the past tense' and apply them to novel words they have never encountered before. Empirical evidence shows that even young children can do this, posing a challenge to connectionist models.

Nonetheless, connectionist models have been more successful in accounting for the developmental sequence in which different verbs classes are acquired. The models can capture the early emergence of regular past tense forms, the later rise in irregular forms, and the protracted development of vowel-change forms. This pattern matches the developmental sequence from empirical studies. The rule-based approach fails to explain why certain rules would be acquired earlier or later. Thus, in terms of sequencing effects, connectionist models provide a more coherent account.

In conclusion, connectionist models of inflectional morphology have been partly successful in accounting for empirical data from development studies. They can replicate U-shaped development and the sequencing effects in acquisition. However, their single mechanism approach struggles to explain children's productive use of rules to generate the past tense of novel words. The debate between connectionist and rule-based approaches is ongoing, suggesting that elements of both perspectives may be needed to fully understand morphological development in children. Overall, while connectionism promises a coherent mechanistic framework, rule-based representations still play an important role in explaining the acquisition of productive inflectional skills.
