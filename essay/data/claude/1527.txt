Here is a draft 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

There are several theoretical aspects that need to be considered in the recruitment and selection of employees in the hospitality and tourism industry. The key aspects include person-organization fit, person-job fit, fairness and bias avoidance, and diversity considerations. 

Person-organization fit refers to the congruence between the values and culture of the organization and the values and personality of the employee. In the hospitality industry, employees who share similar service-oriented values and customer-centric mindsets with the organization are more likely to thrive and stay longer. For example, Ritz-Carlton, a luxury hotel chain, places a strong emphasis on customer service and trains all employees to embrace its "gold standards" of service. By recruiting employees with a natural service mindset who appreciate Ritz-Carlton's culture, the company is able to achieve strong person-organization fit.

Person-job fit refers to the match between a candidate's skills, knowledge, and abilities, and the requirements of the specific job role. For customer-facing roles like front desk agents, waitstaff, and concierges, hospitality companies need to assess if candidates have the right soft skills and temperament to serve customers well. Some evaluate candidates through role-playing scenarios to assess their customer handling abilities. Those who demonstrate patience, an ability to read customer needs, and deftly navigate difficult situations would likely be good fits for the job.

Fairness and bias avoidance are also critical considerations in recruitment and selection. Hospitality companies should evaluate all candidates objectively based on merit and not allow factors like gender, ethnicity or age to influence decisions. Evaluation rubrics and frameworks can be developed to enable fair comparisons between candidates. For instance, some companies assign separate scores for different criteria like relevant experience, soft skills, and technical skills, before arriving at an overall score. Such an approach helps minimize subjective bias.

Diversity and inclusion are also increasingly important, especially for global brands. Hiring candidates from a range of backgrounds and with diverse experiences allows companies to better understand customer needs and cultural preferences. Diversity also promotes creativity through a greater range of perspectives. For example, some hotel chains like Hilton and Marriott have launched targeted programs to hire more minorities and promote women into leadership roles. This fosters an inclusive culture and helps the business gain valuable insights to serve customers from all backgrounds.

In summary, while theoretical considerations are essential for effective recruitment and selection, there is still room for improvement in the hospitality industry. Fairness and mitigating bias should be constantly reviewed to prevent discrimination. Diversity programs should also be strengthened through setting clear targets and goals. With continual commitment to hiring the right candidates who match both the organization's values as well as job requirements, the hospitality industry can achieve optimal person-organization and person-job fit. Overall, balancing all theoretical aspects will enable the recruitment of employees who not only serve customers well but also thrive in their roles.
