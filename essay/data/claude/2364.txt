Here is a 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

Language is one of the most fundamental ways in which we express our identity and connection to social groups. The particular words we choose, the grammatical structures we employ, and the pronunciation conventions we follow are all linked to constructs like class, gender, age, and ethnicity. In this essay, I will explore how class and gender in particular influence the way we use language by shaping grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.  

With respect to class, individuals from higher socioeconomic backgrounds tend to employ different linguistic practices than those from lower classes. For instance, in terms of grammar, members of the upper class are more likely to follow prescriptive rules like ensuring nouns and verbs agree in number and using actual pronouns like 'whom.' They view these forms as more prestigious and proper. In contrast, those from lower classes follow more vernacular grammar conventions that prioritize conveying meaning. In terms of vocabulary, individuals from higher classes deploy more formal and Latinate terms, as well as words denoting prestige or education. For example, a wealthy person might say they feel 'affluent' or 'pecuniary' rather than just 'rich.'

For pronunciation, upper-class speakers are more likely to employ features like dropped or reduced consonant clusters that are viewed as prestigious, such as pronouncing 'probably' as 'prahbly.'  Members of the lower class, on the other hand, are more likely to follow locally accepted vernacular pronunciations. ... Sociolinguistic studies have found a strong correlation between employment of prestige grammar and vocabulary and higher social class across many languages and cultures. 

With respect to gender, men and women also display linguistic differences that reflect social conventions and power structures. For grammar, some studies have found that women use more 'tag questions,' like 'it's hot, isn't it?', and 'hedging phrases' like 'sort of' or 'I think,' which convey uncertainty or seek approval. These forms reflect traditional gender roles where women are expected to be more conciliatory and seek connection. In contrast, men tend employ more forceful grammatical constructions. They are also more likely to use expletive constructions involving taboo or sexual terms, reflecting their greater social privilege to be provocative in speech.

For vocabulary, women more frequently use words denoting emotion, such as 'love,' as well as intensive adverbs like 'so' or 'really.' Women are socialized to discuss emotional topics more openly than men. Men, on the other hand, use more words related to objects, such as 'car' or 'football,' reflecting their traditionally greater participation in these domains. Similarly, for pronunciation, women are encouraged to adopt young female registers involving uptalk or vocal fry, displaying, for example, 'valley girl' speech qualities that are often stigmatized yet continue due to group loyalty. ... Overall, studies show clear differences in how men and women deploy elements like grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation based on gender norms and power structures.

In conclusion, an individual's use of language is far from arbitrary but rather is systematically linked to their class and gender. Through following the informal rules set by these social groups, we signal our membership and allegiances to others. While class and gender both shape how we speak, they represent independent influences and their effects can either be amplified or mitigated depending on an individual's unique combination of social identities. Understanding these dynamics enhances our appreciation for how vital language is in navigating the social world.
