Here is a draft answer to this essay prompt in around 2000 words:

Painting played an important role in the French Revolution, both reflecting the revolutionary ideals and helping to shape public opinion. In the Neoclassical style that dominated in the pre-revolutionary years, and especially in the works of Jacques-Louis David, we can see the emergence and development of concepts like liberty, virtue, and patriotism that would become central to the revolutionary cause. 

In the 1780s, Neoclassical painting embraced themes from classical antiquity, like moral virtue, sacrifice, and duty to one's country. This heroic and idealistic style was a reaction against the perceived decadence and frivolity of the Rococo art that had dominated in the previous decades. Neoclassicism strove for a noble simplicity and austerity that was meant to uplift public morality.

David was the leading proponent of Neoclassicism. Even before the Revolution, his paintings embodied ideals that aligned with the republican values of civic responsibility, patriotism and moral uprightness that would shape the revolutionary ethos. His "Oath of the Horatii" from 1784 depicts soldiers pledging allegiance to the state, valuing civic duty over personal attachments. This kind of moral subject matter and stringent, austere style primed audiences to receive the revolutionary messages that would soon follow.

After the Revolution began in 1789, David's paintings took on more overtly political themes to propagate revolutionary ideals. In "The Death of Marat" (1793), David turned the radical journalist Jean-Paul Marat into a martyred saint, using Neoclassical conventions to make a political point about sacrifice for the revolutionary cause. The painting is hagiographic propaganda, meant to inspire citizens to follow Marat's moral example. Similarly, "The Tennis Court Oath" (1791) turned a pivotal event of the early Revolution into a timeless allegory of courage, virtue and patriotic duty.

Between 1789 and 1792, we see a shift in Neoclassical painting toward more contemporaneous subject matter, as current events of the Revolution began to inspire artists. There is also a change in tone, as canvases took on more patriotic and at times propagandistic messages.    The style that had once seemed reactionary now powerfully evoked revolutionary ideals, as images of moral citizenship and a commitment to public good resonated with the core tenets of liberty and republicanism.

In conclusion, Neoclassical painting and Jacques-Louis David's works in particular proved instrumental in shaping public opinion during the early years of the French Revolution. The style and subjects of Neoclassical art evolved in tandem with the Revolution, giving visual form to the ideological shift from monarchy to republic, and helping to spread revolutionary fervor through emotive and inspiring works of art. Painting was not just a reflection of the Revolution's principles, but also a means of enacting them in the public imagination.
