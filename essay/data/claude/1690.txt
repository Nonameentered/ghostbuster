Here is a draft 1000 word essay in response to the prompt:

Ben Jonson's poem "On My First Son" and John O'Callaghan's poem "I Would Not Ask For Thanks" portray the grief of losing a loved one through different poetic forms, showing how structure can complement and enhance themes. Jonson employs a tightly regulated rhyme scheme and meter to convey how grief can impose a rigid order, whereas O'Callaghan uses free verse to mirror the raw, unstructured anguish of loss.

Jonson's poem is composed of a series of rhyming couplets in iambic pentameter, reflecting the imposition of a strict form onto painful subject matter. The rhyming couplets create a sense of inevitability, as each line calls forward the next in a locked chain. This mirrors how grief can feel inescapable, as memories and loss permeate the mourner's thoughts with a crushing sense of inevitability. The steady iambic meter also reinforces this by giving the poem a plodding, inexorable quality, reflecting the slow, steady march of grief. The strict form suggests how grief can impose an unwilling order and control.  

In contrast, O'Callaghan's poem is composed in free verse, using uneven line lengths, inconsistent or absent punctuation and rhyme. This loose structure mirrors the uncontained, chaotic nature of fresh grief, which ruptures normal patterns of thought and speech. The erratic lines and lack of punctuation create a sense of overflowing emotion that cannot be restrained within normal poetic conventions. The absence of rhyme also avoids imposing any sense of inevitability or order, reflecting how grief can feel random and unjust. The free verse form thus complements the raw emotion and painfully disrupted thoughts portrayed in the poem.

In conclusion, Jonson and O'Callaghan take different approaches to poetic form which ably reinforce their themes of grief. Jonson's tightly controlled rhyme and meter creates a sense of the inescapability and unwilling order imposed by grief. By contrast, O'Callaghan's free verse mirrors the overflowing emotion and chaotic anguish of loss. The poems show how poetic form, whether rigid or loose, can work in tandem with subject matter to create layers of meaning. Overall, they are exemplars of how poetic structure and themes can be brought into harmony.
