Acute dyspnea, or shortness of breath, in elderly patients can be caused by a number of conditions, especially when there is a longstanding history of asthma. The most likely diagnoses include uncontrolled asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The management of acute dyspnea involves promptly determining the underlying cause, providing supplemental oxygen, and treating any reversible conditions. 

In a patient with a history of asthma, the most likely cause of acute dyspnea is an asthma exacerbation. As asthma progresses over many years, lung function can become irreversibly reduced, even with optimal management. Elderly patients may experience more frequent exacerbations as their asthma becomes more severe and less reversible. An asthma exacerbation presents with acute onset of wheezing, chest tightness, cough, and dyspnea. On exam, there are prolonged expiratory wheezes and a prolonged expiratory phase. Management includes bronchodilators, oral corticosteroids, and supplemental oxygen. Hospitalization may be required for severe exacerbations to provide intensive bronchodilator and corticosteroid therapy.

Pneumonia is another possible cause of dyspnea in the elderly and can be a complication of asthma exacerbations if they are severe or unrecognized. Patients with pneumonia present with acute onset of dyspnea, fever, cough productive of sputum, and pleuritic chest pain. Cytology and radiographs can confirm the diagnosis. Bacterial pneumonia is most common and is treated with a course of antibiotics. Hospitalization is often required, especially in elderly or vulnerable patients. Oxygen therapy and bronchodilators may also be used to improve oxygenation and ease work of breathing.

Heart failure is a frequent cause of dyspnea in the elderly and can accompany or exacerbate asthma and COPD. Heart failure reduces the pumping capacity of the heart, leading to fluid accumulation in the lungs and dyspnea. Patients present with dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and peripheral edema. Exam may reveal elevated jugular venous pressure, an S3 heart sound, and rales on lung exam. Management includes diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and supplemental oxygen. Hospitalization is often needed to optimize management.

Similarly, a COPD exacerbation can lead to acute dyspnea in patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. COPD exacerbations are characterized by acute worsening of cough, sputum production, and dyspnea. Wheezing and prolonged expiration may be present. Cytology and pulmonary function tests can aid diagnosis. Management includes bronchodilators, oral corticosteroids, antibiotics if there is evidence of infection, and oxygen therapy. As with other causes of acute dyspnea, hospitalization may be needed depending on severity.

In summary, for an elderly woman with asthma presenting with acute dyspnea, the most likely differential diagnoses are asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, heart failure exacerbation, and COPD exacerbation. Thorough history, physical exam, pulse oximetry, chest radiographs, electrocardiograms, and basic laboratory tests can determine the underlying cause. Management focuses on supplemental oxygen, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and treating any reversible conditions to improve symptoms and oxygenation.
