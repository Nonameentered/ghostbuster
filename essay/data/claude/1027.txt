Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) face unique challenges in developing sustainable management information systems and strategies (MIS/ISS) compared to larger organizations. SMEs typically have limited resources and technical expertise to invest in robust information systems. However, as SMEs grow, their information needs also become more complex, necessitating strategic information systems to support key business processes and decision making.  

For SMEs like Rembitt, systems integration (SI) is critical to developing a sustainable ISS. SI refers to the process of integrating different information systems and databases across the organization into a unified system that provides a integrated view of business information. For Rembitt, some key SI priorities should be:

1. Integrating financial systems. As an SME in the service industry, Rembitt likely has various financial systems to manage accounting, payroll, invoicing, and more. Integrating these into a single system would reduce manual data entry, minimise errors, and provide managers with holistic financial reports to support decision making.

2. Integrating customer relationship management (CRM) systems. Rembitt provides ongoing service contracts to customers, so a CRM system to track customer interactions, service histories, and contracts is essential. Integrating the CRM with financial and project management systems would provide a 360-degree view of each customer and project. This helps ensure high quality and personalised service.

3. Standardizing data and business processes. Before systems integration can occur, Rembitt needs to standardize its data, metrics and business processes. This includes using common data definitions, standardizing how metrics are calculated, and aligning business processes across the organization. Standardization is a prerequisite for efficient SI and sustainable ISS.

Some key issues for Rembitt in developing a sustainable ISS are:

1. Limited resources: As an SME, Rembitt likely struggles with limited financial and technical resources to invest in ISS. It needs to start small and focus on high-priority areas, then incrementally improve and integrate over time as resources allow.

2. Lack of technical expertise: Rembitt probably has limited internal IT and technical staff, so would need to outsource or get external support for some SI initiatives. It also needs to invest in developing internal technical management expertise to own and sustain the ISS.  

3. Resistance to change: Some staff and managers may resist the changes required to implement new integrated systems and standardized processes. Rembitt needs to invest in change management and provide staff training to overcome this resistance.

In summary, SI is crucial for SMEs like Rembitt to develop a sustainable ISS that meets their growing information needs. With limited resources, SMEs must prioritize high-impact initiatives, tap into external technical expertise, and invest in change management to overcome resistance. With the right strategic approach, SMEs can achieve sustainable ISS despite their size and resource constraints.
