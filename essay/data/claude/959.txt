To What Extent Can the Downs Model of Voting Explain the Result of the 2005 UK General Election?

The Downsian model of voting, put forward by Anthony Downs in his seminal work An Economic Theory of Democracy, argues that rational voters will support the political party that proposes policies closest to their own ideological preferences. In a two-party system like the UK, the model suggests that the party that is able to position itself closest to the median voter will emerge victorious in the election. At first glance, the results of the 2005 UK General Election, in which Labour won a third consecutive term in government, seem to support the predictive power of the Downsian model. However, a closer analysis reveals significant limitations of the model in explaining the outcome.  

The Downsian model assumes that voters will choose the party that proposes policies closest to their ideological preferences in a rational and self-interested manner. In 2005, Labour strategically positioned itself close to the median voter under Tony Blair’s leadership, adopting more centrist “Third Way” policies and rhetoric that appealed to swing voters. In contrast, the Conservative opposition failed to do the same and remained anchored to more traditionally right-wing positions. Given this, the model would predict that Labour would win over more median voters. And indeed, Labour did win over more voters, gaining a popular vote share of 35% compared to the Conservatives’ 32%.

However, the assumption of rational and self-interested voting is problematic. Voters do not always make choices based on policy positions alone. Other factors, like party loyalty, leader evaluations, and perceived competency also strongly influence voter choice. In 2005, Tony Blair still enjoyed high approval ratings and was seen as a competent leader, while Conservative leader Michael Howard was unpopular and seen as less capable. This likely contributed to Labour’s win as much as their policy positions. The Downsian model cannot account for the role of these non-policy factors in voter decision making.  

The model also does not consider the diversity of voter preferences and tendency for ideological polarization along demographic lines. Voters have a range of views across different policy dimensions, and do not always align in a simplistic left-right spectrum. In 2005, Labour won over urban and minority ethnic voters, while the Conservatives found more support among rural and affluent voters. The parties’ manifestos thus appealed to very different segments of the electorate based on their ideological and material interests. The Downsian model overlooks such diversity and assumes a singular median voter, limiting its explanatory power.

In conclusion, while the Downsian model provides some valuable insights into the outcome of the 2005 election, showing how Labour was able to gain more centrist support by moving closer to the median voter, the model is limited by its narrow assumptions of rational and self-interested voting. Voter choice depends on a multitude of factors, and the diversity of preferences means there is no single median voter. The model cannot fully account for Labour's victory without considering these other influences on voter decision making and the differing bases of support for each party. The Downsian model provides a simplified model of electoral competition that requires greater nuance and complexity to understand real-world election results.
