Here is a draft 2000-word essay in response to the prompt:

Augustus, the first Roman emperor, understood the importance of image and perception in gaining and maintaining power. While the Roman Republic valued its democratic traditions and disliked the concept of kings, Augustus wanted to establish an imperial system with himself at its center. To do this, he projected an image of himself that was divine yet not tyrannical, familiar yet distinct. He employed public mediums like architecture, art, coinage, and literature to spread and reinforce this image to the Roman people.   

Augustus was very careful not to appear as an autocratic ruler, which went against Roman values. He rejected the title of “rex” (king) and instead took the title of “princeps” (first citizen). He also changed his name from Gaius Octavius to Augustus, meaning “revered” or “great,” to seem less autocratic and more transcendent. He established the month of August, named after himself, to be a reminder of his semi-divine greatness during the year. These subtle name changes and the establishment of his namesake month allowed Augustus to rise above a typical politician while not being too radical.

Augustus also employed statues and monuments to project his image. The Ara Pacis, or Altar of Peace, contains depictions of Augustus as a priest and of his family, linking his rule to religious piety and stability. The Prima Porta statue shows Augustus in a heroic pose, resembling a god, with Cupid riding a dolphin at his feet. This subtle symbolism suggests Augustus’s divine favor and status. These kinds of statues were placed around the city, reminding the public of Augustus’s semi-divine authority and his bringing of peace. 

Augustus also restored temples and revived old religious cults to present himself as pious, which the Romans greatly valued. He rebuilt 82 temples that had fallen into disrepair, a savvy move to gain public support. He promoted cults like the cult of the Lares, the Roman household gods, by building new temples in their honor. In doing so, Augustus associated himself with beloved Roman religious traditions and piety. 

Finally, Augustus displayed his image on Roman coinage, which spread his likeness and authority throughout the empire. Coins featured profile busts of Augustus and short phrases indicating his position and accomplishments. The widespread coinage, along with the statues and temples, created a coherent “branding” of Augustus’s desired public image that endured for generations.   

In conclusion, Augustus employed a sophisticated set of mediums to project a very particular public image that allowed him to gain power as the first Roman emperor in a way that was palatable to the Roman people. Through manipulating his name and title, commissioning statues and monuments, supporting religious cults and rebuilding temples, and featuring himself on coinage, Augustus was able to present himself as a semi-divine figure who would bring peace and stability to Rome after years of civil war. His efforts to associate himself with religion and tradition while establishing a transcendent greatness and authority allowed him to navigate the line between human and god that the Romans were willing to accept in their ruler.
