Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), which involves altering the composition of gases surrounding food products in packaging, is commonly used to extend the shelf life and preserve the quality of meat. Two gases frequently used in MAP of meat are oxygen and carbon dioxide. High oxygen MAP, containing 60-80% oxygen, is effective at maintaining the bright red color of myoglobin, the oxygen-binding protein responsible for the characteristic color of meat. However, the high oxygen levels can also accelerate lipid oxidation and the formation of metmyoglobin, the oxidized form of myoglobin that causes meat to turn brown. 

Oxygen is essential for the formation of oxymyoglobin, the complex that gives fresh meat its bright red color. When meat is exposed to air, myoglobin binds with oxygen to form oxymyoglobin. In high oxygen MAP, the high levels of oxygen surrounding the meat allow oxymyoglobin to continue to form and maintain a bright red color. However, as the meat ages, the oxymyoglobin eventually oxidizes into metmyoglobin, causing the brown discoloration. High oxygen MAP slows this oxidation and discoloration but does not prevent it entirely.

While high oxygen MAP helps preserve red meat color, the high oxygen levels also pose risks. Oxygen is a reactant in the lipid oxidation process, which leads to the production of rancid flavors and odors that cause meat to spoil. Oxygen also accelerates the oxidation of oxymyoglobin into metmyoglobin. To counteract these undesirable effects, antioxidants such as vitamin E are often added when using high oxygen MAP. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant by inhibiting the propagation of free radicals that lead to lipid oxidation and oxymyoglobin oxidation. 

MAP with high carbon dioxide levels, containing 20-40% carbon dioxide, takes a different approach to preserving meat quality. Carbon dioxide inhibits the growth of spoilage bacteria, molds, and yeast through its bacteriostatic and fungistatic effects. The reduced spoilage microbe growth in turn slows the formation of metmyoglobin and lipid oxidation. However, while high carbon dioxide MAP effectively controls spoilage, it does not actively maintain meat color like high oxygen MAP. Meat in high carbon dioxide MAP will still turn brown over time due to residual oxygen left in the packaging and oxidation of oxymyoglobin and lipids.

In conclusion, MAP technology and antioxidants are useful tools for extending the shelf life of meat while preserving its quality and color. High oxygen MAP slows discoloration but oxidizes lipids and promotes metmyoglobin formation, requiring the use of antioxidants like vitamin E. High carbon dioxide MAP reduces spoilage microbes but does not maintain bright red meat color. Using a combination of these approaches can provide optimal results. MAP provides economic benefits to producers and consumers, but also raises questions about how these technologies might impact the naturalness and wholesomeness of meat.
