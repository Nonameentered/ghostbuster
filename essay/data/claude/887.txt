Here is a 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

An experiment was conducted to explore the design of a measurement system for measuring low-level forces. The objective was to build a force measurement system that could measure forces in the range of 0 to 5 Newtons with high sensitivity and accuracy. The output of the system was observed using a digital multimeter to measure the voltage output, which was directly proportional to the applied loading force. There were a few sources of errors associated with the system including friction in the moving parts, variability in electronic components like resistors, and limitations in the analog to digital conversion.  

To measure the low-level forces, a spring-based force sensor was used which contained a linear spring and a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). As an external force was applied to the spring, its deformation caused the LVDT core to move, which then produced an output voltage proportional to the displacement and hence the applied force. The overall equation relating the output voltage to the loading force was:

Voltage = (Factor) x Displacement = (Factor) x (Spring Constant) x Force

The data was collected using a Labview program which measured the voltage output from the LVDT for different loading forces applied. The linear range of the sensor was between 0.2 to 4.8 Newtons based on the spring used. The sensitivity was calculated to be 0.417 V/N in this range.

The maximum loading force allowed for this system was 5 Newtons based on the maximum deformation that could be measured by the LVDT before hitting its built-in stops. Beyond this point, the output voltage would saturate and not increase with increasing loading force.

The graphs produced from the data represented the calibration curve for the force sensor, showing the output voltage versus the loading force. The sensitivity of the measurement system depended both on the output gain/amplification of the LVDT signal conditioner and the spring constant of the spring. The errors increased with increasing loading force due to larger deformations of the spring introducing more variability in the displacement measurement and the system moving away from the linear range of operation.

In summary, the experiment allowed for the design and characterization of a low-level force measurement system using a spring-based force sensor and LVDT. Within certain loading ranges, the system showed good sensitivity and linearity but the errors and nonlinearity increased at higher loading forces as expected based on the components and setup used. For higher loading forces, a different sensor setup with lower gain and stiffer components may help improve the performance.
