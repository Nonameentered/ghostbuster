The use of personal pronouns in American Presidents' inaugural speeches has varied substantially over time, reflecting changes in rhetorical and leadership styles. Early Presidents in the 18th and 19th centuries employed a detached, formal style with a focus on shared national values and less explicit appeals to unity. They rarely used first-person singular or plural pronouns like "I" or "we". In contrast, 20th century Presidents adopted a more personal, inspiring tone aimed at forging connections with citizens. They frequently employed "we" to evoke a spirit of shared purpose and community. 

Analysis of pronoun use through corpus linguistics provides insight into these rhetorical choices and their impact. A study of a corpus of all inaugural speeches shows the frequency of "I"  increased from about 5 instances per 10,000 words in early speeches to 50 instances in recent speeches. Use of "we" exhibited a similar increase, from about 20 to over 200 instances per 10,000 words. The increasing use of these pronouns signals a shift to a more engaged, relatable leadership style.

Early presidents like Washington and Jefferson conveyed a formal tone in keeping with the detached virtues of Republicanism that shaped the new nation. Their speeches invoke shared political principles and abstract entities like "the people" but make minimal use of "I" or "we". For example, Washington's second inaugural address in 1793 does not contain a single "I" or "we". This rhetorical choice reinforces his authority as an almost mythical figure embodying the presidency itself.

In the 20th century, presidents adopted a more personal style aimed at unifying citizens. For instance, FDR used "we" over 200 times in his 1933 speech to convey a spirit of shared purpose during the Great Depression. Kennedy evoked civic responsibility by stating "ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country." By the modern era, presidents like Clinton and Obama frequently employed "we" to signal inclusiveness, using phrases like "we the people".

The increasing use of personal pronouns has strengthened presidents' perception as relatable leaders with a common purpose and shared identity with citizens. A president's choice of pronouns significantly impacts their ability to build solidarity by framing issues from the collective "we" or distinguishing their individual leadership with "I". The language of presidents thus provides insights into evolving conceptions of American identity and civic responsibility as well as the role of the presidency itself. Overall, the increasing use of "we" has reflected presidents' aims to be perceived not just as authoritative leaders but as representatives and partners of a united people.
