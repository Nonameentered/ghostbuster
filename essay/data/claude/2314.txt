Here is a draft 2250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Organic farming has grown in popularity in recent years as consumers have become more conscious about the environmental and health impacts of industrial agriculture. While organic farming offers some significant benefits over conventional industrial farming, it also has some drawbacks that are worth considering.

One of the biggest benefits of organic farming is its environmental sustainability. Organic farming prohibits the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, which require large amounts of petroleum to produce and transport. The excessive use of these chemicals in industrial agriculture has led to water and soil pollution as the chemicals leach into groundwater and waterways. Organic farming also promotes biodiversity by avoiding monocrops and encouraging crop rotation and diversity. The soil health and structure is improved over time through use of compost and manure rather than synthetic fertilizers.

However, organic farming is less efficient in terms of yield per acre, so it requires more land to produce the same amount of food. This can lead to deforestation and loss of habitat for wildlife. Organic farming also requires more manual labor since it avoids use of synthetic herbicides, and weeding must be done manually or mechanically. This requires more workers and increases costs. While organic food prices are often higher, organic farmers see little of that premium, as most goes to processors and retailers.

For human health, organic food is free from chemical residues and more nutritious. It has more vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats than conventional food. However, some studies show little measurable health benefit, and organic food is more prone to bacterial contamination due to lack of preservatives. There is also little evidence that organic meat or dairy provide substantial health benefits over conventional products. For those unable to afford organic food, conventional food can absolutely be part of a healthy diet.

For livestock, organic farming provides better animal welfare. Organic standards require that animals have access to outdoor spaces and can engage in natural behaviors. They are also not given hormones or antibiotics. However, space requirements mean that organic meat and dairy production cannot meet current demand. And while antibiotic use is prohibited for growth promotion, animals that become sick can still be treated, so "antibiotic-free" claims are misleading.

In conclusion, while organic agriculture offers substantial benefits to the environment, human health, and animal welfare, there are also significant drawbacks. For most people, a balanced perspective that incorporates options from both organic and sustainable conventional agriculture is needed to optimize nutrition, affordability, and sustainability. Overall, more research is still needed to determine conclusively whether organic food and farming provide substantial benefits over an optimized conventional system.
