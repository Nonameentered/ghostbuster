Penguin marketing team employed several strategies to effectively target readers for the re-launch of Will Self's short story collection as an adult  paperback. These strategies focused on positioning the book to appeal to both existing fans of Will Self's work as well as new readers yet to discover him. 

The cover design of the paperback edition signaled the irreverent and subversive tone of Self's writing. The striking artwork featured a dark yet whimsical illustration of flying books with eyes, positioned against a bright pink background. This surreal and quirky design aligned with Self's acerbic style and the absurdist themes in the stories. The unusual cover served to intrigue casual bookshop browsers and connote the subversive spirit they could expect from the contents. For devotees of Self's work, the cover design reinforced expectations of his signature unconventional approach.

Penguin also carefully crafted endorsement quotes prominently featured on the back cover from well-known authors in Will Self's circle, like Martin Amis and Ali Smith. For regular readers of Self and his contemporaries, these names  carried significant weight and credibility. Their praise of the collection as "disturbing, strange and cruelly funny" or "bloody hilarious" carried a stamp of approval from Self's literary milieu. For those less familiar with these authors, their renown still lent an air of prestige and suggested the cultish appeal of Self's style. These endorsements worked on multiple levels to target both dedicated and new audiences.

The flashy pink color scheme of the cover was also intended to make a visual impact on shelves to capture interest. While the color was a nod to the postmodern stylings  of the stories, it was also a way to make the volume jump out in store displays, perusing the fiction section or coming across it serendipitously while browsing. The bright pink conveyed a sense of playfulness to counteract preconceptions of highbrow literary fiction as dry or dull. This spirit of fun and subversion, combined with the surreal cover image, presented the work as iconoclastic and provocative.

Inside the volume, a wry and intriguing author biography framed Self as a celebrated yet controversial figure of avant-garde British fiction, referencing his "postmodern pyrotechnics" and "wilful difficulty." For existing readers, this reinforcement of Self's rebellious and unconventional persona would strengthen the appeal. For new readers, curiosity may be sparked about this complex and subversive authorial voice. Subtle references to Self's notoriety for "upending literary conventions" worked to target more sophisticated readers seeking an irreverent challenge.

In summary, through a combination of promotional strategies, Penguin astutely tailored the re-launch of this short story collection to engage both Self's established fanbase as well as new audiences in search of an offbeat literary experience. With a daring cover design, provocative endorsements, an quirky author profile and flashes of playfulness, the marketing team achieved a fine balance of signaling the work's avant-garde sensibility while also broadening its mainstream appeal. The reimagining of the collection as an audacious pink paperback proved an innovative strategy to revitalize interest in Will Self's idiosyncratic style.
