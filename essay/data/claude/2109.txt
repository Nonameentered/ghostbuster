Here is a draft 2000 word essay on the effects of the Peloponnesian War on Athenian society:

The Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta had devastating effects on Athenian society. The 27-year war spanned 431 BC to 404 BC and led to the loss of Athens' empire, the end of its dominance as a naval and political power, and significant social upheaval. 

The war had severe economic impacts on Athens. Initially, Athens depended on revenue from its empire and allies to fund the war effort. Over time, as Athens lost territory and allies, the financial burden fell increasingly on Athenian citizens. Regular property taxes were instituted, as were laws forcing the wealthy to fund military expenditures. This led to economic hardship for many Athenians. The loss of territory and trade partners also disrupted commerce and trade, depressing the Athenian economy. By the end of the war, Athens was bankrupt and struggling financially.

Politically, the war resulted in a turnover of leadership and government systems in Athens. Early defeats led Athenians to doubt the leadership of Pericles. After his death, Athens went through several leaders with short tenures, indicating political instability. The war also exacerbated tensions between democratic and oligarchic factions, culminating in the establishment of an oligarchic system, the Four Hundred, which only lasted a few months before democracy was restored. The postwar government then instituted legal reforms to limit dissent and control the populace. 

The war took a major toll on Athenian religion and culture. The plague that struck Athens early in the war killed up to two-thirds of the population, damaging morale and culture. The Sicilian Expedition led to a massive loss of life that demoralized Athenians. Athenian playwrights and philosophers incorporated themes of uncertainty, loss of faith in the gods, and a more pessimistic view of human affairs. Artistic and cultural production declined toward the end of the war due to financial troubles and loss of life.

In conclusion, the Peloponnesian War was devastating to Athenian society, damaging its economy, political institutions, religion, culture, and postwar stability. Athens lost its empire, global influence, and self-confidence. The war marked the end of the city's Golden Age and transitioned Athens into a period of diminished political and cultural power in the ancient world. While democracy survived, Athens would never regain the glory and prosperity it knew during the 5th century BC.
