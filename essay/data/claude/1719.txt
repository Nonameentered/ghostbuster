Three methods commonly used for analysing mechanisms are visual inspection, vector approach, and virtual simulation. While visual inspection requires no quantitative data and relies mainly on experience, it fails to provide precise results and is ineffective for complex mechanisms.

The vector approach uses the geometry and vectors of mechanisms to analyse velocity, acceleration, and forces. For a four bar mechanism, one can draw scaled vector diagrams showing the position, velocity and acceleration of each link at different configurations to understand the motion and dynamics. This method requires trigonometric calculations and an understanding of vectors, making it more difficult to grasp compared to visual inspection. However, it generates quantitative results and works for most mechanisms. 

Virtual simulation uses computer software to create a virtual model of the mechanism. The model can then be manipulated to study its motion and performance. For a four bar mechanism, one can model each link as a rigid body and apply forces and constraints to simulate the mechanism. Simulation provides the most detailed and accurate analysis as it gives data on position, velocity, acceleration, reaction forces, torque, power, etc. However, it requires expensive software and intensive training to operate.

Of the three methods, virtual simulation offers the most comprehensive and precise analysis due to its ability to generate massive amounts of data visualisation. Its main drawbacks are cost and complexity. In contrast, the vector approach, while still generating quantitative results, requires only basic vector knowledge and simpler calculations. It offers sufficient accuracy for most mechanisms at minimal cost.

In conclusion, to analyse mechanisms in a cost-effective manner, the vector approach is the most suitable. It meets the requirements of reasonable accuracy, ease of use with minimal training, low cost, and sufficiently quick mechanism analysis. For more complex mechanisms where higher precision is needed, virtual simulation can then be employed. The vector approach is an simple but effective first step to help companies understand mechanisms and improve production.
