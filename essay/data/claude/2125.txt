X-bar theory, proposed by Noam Chomsky in 1970, aims to describe the internal structure of phrases in syntax. It seeks to capture certain generalizations about the configuration and ordering of constituents cross-linguistically. At its core, X-bar theory specifies that phrases have a hierarchical, nested structure, with a head at the center that projects to higher levels. When it was first introduced, X-bar theory provided a significant improvement in descriptive and explanatory adequacy over previous models in generative syntax.

Descriptively, X-bar theory accounts for the observation that phrases of the same syntactic category, e.g. noun phrases (NPs), verb phrases (VPs), etc., often contain very similar constituents, just in different orders and quantities. For example, the NPs "the old red house" and "this small cottage" both contain a determiner, an adjective, and a noun - they just differ in the specific items and number of adjectives. The theory captures this pattern by proposing that all phrases contain a head at the core, and optionally one or more specifier and adjunct phrases on the periphery. This allows for all attested phrase patterns to be described in a concise and comprehensive way.  

X-bar theory is also explanatorily adequate because it provides a reason why phrases should have this particular structure and ordering of elements. The key idea is that phrases are built up by the projection of a head word to form a layered structure. The head projects to an Xʹ level, which dominates the complements to form a small clause. This small clause then projects further to a full XP level, which dominates any specifiers or adjuncts. This allows the theory to explain, for example, why a determiner like "the" should appear external to any adjectives - because specifiers like determiners attach at the XP level, outside the Xʹ small clause that contains the adjectives as complements. 

To take an example, we can illustrate X-bar theory with the NP "the old red house". The head noun "house" projects first to Nʹ, which combines with the complements "old" and "red" (adjectives). This forms an Nʹ small clause. The small clause then projects to the full NP level, where the specifier "the" is added. The structure would be:

NP
    |
the   Nʹ 
     |     
N   old  red
    |
house

This structure both describes the surface ordering of elements correctly and provides an explanation for why the determiner appears externally. X-bar theory therefore achieves significant descriptive and explanatory adequacy for phrase structure in syntax. It has provided a very influential model for studying and understanding syntax cross-linguistically.
