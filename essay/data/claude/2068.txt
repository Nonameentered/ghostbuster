Four different habitats in the Rennes field centre in Brittany, France were surveyed to determine and compare their species diversity. The sites surveyed were a lake, a stream, an oak forest, and a meadow. At each site, different methods were used to collect a variety of organisms to calculate indices of diversity. 

At the lake, a net was used to sample zooplankton and sweepings were taken of vegetation around the lake to collect insects and other invertebrates. At the stream, a net was again used to collect invertebrates in the water column and sweepings were taken of vegetation and rocks along the stream. In the oak forest, sweepings were taken at multiple spots throughout the forest. At the meadow, pitfall traps were used to capture ground-dwelling invertebrates and sweepings were taken of vegetation. Organisms collected at each site were identified and counted to calculate the species richness, Shannon diversity index, and Simpson's diversity index.

The lake site exhibited the highest diversity of the four sites according to all three diversity measures. The lake had the highest species richness with over 50 different species of zooplankton and invertebrates identified. The Shannon index was over 3, indicating a very high diversity, and Simpson's index was over 0.95, indicating an even distribution of species. The high diversity of the lake can be attributed to the availability of food resources, suitable habitats, and nesting sites in and around the lake environment. The abiotic conditions of the lake including temperature, pH, and mineral availability were also suitable for sustaining many different species. 

The stream site had a high diversity as well, with over 40 different species identified. The flowing water provided habitat, food sources, and oxygen for many types of invertebrates and the riparian zone alongside the stream also provided habitat for other species. The Shannon index for the stream was over 2.5, suggesting fairly high diversity, and Simpson's index was 0.92, indicating an uneven distribution of species. The abiotic conditions of the stream strongly influenced the distribution and diversity of species.

The oak forest had the lowest diversity of the four sites according to the diversity indices. Only about 25 different species were identified in the forest. The canopy cover limited the amount of light and moisture available for undergrowth and the acidic leaf litter on the forest floor provided habitat for only certain tolerant species. The Shannon index was under 2, indicating low diversity, and Simpson's index was 0.85, indicating an uneven distribution of species in the community. The forest environment itself limited diversity.

The meadow site had intermediate diversity with about 30 different species identified. The openness of the meadow provided habitat and food for species that favored sunlight and thicker vegetation. The Shannon index for the meadow was around 2.3 and Simpson's index was 0.88. The diversity of the meadow was influenced by the abiotic conditions as well as interactions between species in the community such as competition and predation.

In summary, the lake site had the highest diversity due to the availability of habitats and food and suitable abiotic conditions for sustaining many species. The stream had high diversity influenced by flowing water and interactions between riparian and aquatic communities. The oak forest had the lowest diversity due to shade limiting plant growth and the acidic environment. The meadow had intermediate diversity influenced by open habitat, abiotic factors, and biotic interactions. Factors affecting distribution and diversity were ecosystem type, availability of resources, and tolerance for environmental conditions. The lake had the greatest variety of invertebrates due to these factors offering more niches for species to exploit.
