When organisations replace their existing order processing systems, three key objectives they should keep in mind are:

1. Improving operational efficiency. By digitizing and automating manual paper-based processes, operational efficiency can be significantly enhanced in terms of reduced time and cost of processing orders. Newer order processing systems can integrate with Enterprise Resource Planning software to provide a seamless flow of information across the organisation. This reduces duplicate data entry, minimises errors, and speeds up processes. 

2. Enhancing customer experience. Modern order processing systems provide customers more convenient and flexible ways to place and track orders through online channels and mobile apps in addition to traditional phone and in-store ordering. This omni-channel experience and visibility into order status at every stage improves customer satisfaction. Integrating orders, invoices and payments across channels also provides a consistent experience.

3. Gaining data-driven insights. Newer order processing systems capture significant volumes of data that can provide valuable insights into customer behaviours, product trends and operational performance through data mining and analytics. This can help organisations optimise products, pricing and promotions to boost sales. Data-driven insights also facilitate continuous improvement of business processes.

The success of implementing an Enterprise IT Architecture framework can be measured through:

1. Achievement of business outcomes: The key outcomes identified in the business architecture such as improved customer experience, increased operational efficiency and data-driven decision making. Metrics can track progress against baseline to validate success. 

2. Adoption across business units: The extent to which the architecture principles, models and standards have been adopted by different business units. Regular reviews and audits can verify compliance and consistency.

3. Reduced complexity and duplication: How much the architecture has streamlined systems, eliminated redundant components and defined clear authoritative sources for data and processes. 

4. Improved agility: Measured by the ability to swiftly incorporate new technologies, adapt the architecture and scale digital solutions to changing business needs. An agile architecture provides flexibility and modularity.

The TOGAF ADM method can be used to integrate the Fujitsu Point-of-Sale architecture and ARTS Data Model into the Enterprise Architecture as follows:

1. Architecture Vision: Develop the vision and principles for integrating the retail-specific architectures with the overall enterprise architecture. Identify key drivers and outcomes.

2. Business Architecture: Map the business processes, functions, data, and key performance indicators described in the retail architectures to the overall business architecture. Identify any gaps and requirements. 

3. Information Systems Architecture: Evaluate how the systems, software and technology components in the retail architectures can be incorporated into the enterprise platforms, infrastructure and applications. Determine integration and migration options. 

4. Technology Architecture: Assess how to make the retail architectures compatible with the enterprise technology standards and roadmaps for implementation. Address any constraints.  

5. Opportunities and Solutions: Explore how the retail architectures can leverage or enhance existing enterprise solutions and determine any new solutions needed. Develop roadmaps for integration and rollout.

6. Migration Planning: Create detailed schedules and actions for transitioning to the integrated architecture based on priorities and resources. Manage communication and address risks.

7. Implementation Governance: Define governance and assurance processes for the integrated architecture to maintain integrity, security and compliance as well as continued adoption. Monitor KPIs and compliance.

Keeping sensitive data and processes hidden in an enterprise architecture is challenging given the need to share information across the organisation. Architecture principles that can help address this include:

1. Security by Design: Build security controls and safeguards into the architecture and solutions from the outset rather than relying solely on blanket policies. This embeds security in all areas.

2. Need-to-Know Access: Restrict access to confidential data and processes to only those roles and users that 'need to know' them to perform their functions. Apply 'least-privilege' access.  

3. Abstract and Modularise: Mask sensitive data through abstraction and modularise security controls so they are integrated throughout the architecture. This avoids conspicuous concentrations of security measures.

4. Monitor and Audit: Continuously monitor for breaches of controls and unauthorised access using tools built into the architecture. Conduct regular audits to verify compliance and make improvements.

5. Educate and Evangelise: Provide ongoing education and training to raise awareness about protecting sensitive information assets. Promote a culture of proactive security through policy and advocacy.

In summary, the objectives of improving operational efficiency, enhancing customer experience and enabling data-driven insights should guide the replacement of order processing systems. The TOGAF ADM method can systematically integrate retail-specific architectures into the enterprise architecture by mapping business, information systems and technology elements and then developing solutions and migration plans for a cohesive outcome. Applying architecture principles focused on security by design, restricted access, abstraction, modularity, monitoring and education helps keep sensitive data and processes hidden. Measuring achievement of business goals, adoption, reduced complexity, and improved agility validates the success of the enterprise architecture.
