What is the Connection Between Birth Order, Personality, and Parental Treatment?

The relationship between an individual's birth order, their personality, and how they were treated by their parents has been a topic of interest for years. Many conflicting findings have emerged, with some research showing connections between birth order and personality traits, while others find no significant relationships. This essay examines whether an individual's extroversion or introversion is correlated with their birth order, and explores the potential effects of parental treatment in such a relationship.

The experimental hypothesis for this essay is that birth order has a significant effect on an individual's extroversion or introversion, mediated through differing parental treatment. Eldest children often receive the most rules and responsibilities, stricter discipline, and higher expectations from parents. This may lead eldest children to become more introverted, compliant, and achievement-oriented. Youngest children frequently experience more lenient rules and lower expectations, potentially resulting in more extroverted, sociable personalities. Middle or only children may develop traits from both ends of the spectrum.  

Data was collected from self-reported surveys of 83 participants: 34 eldest children, 30 youngest children, and 19 middle/only children. Descriptive statistics show the mean scores for extroversion were highest for youngest children (M=32) and middle/only children  (M=30), and lowest for eldest children (M=28), indicating a potential relationship. A one-way ANOVA found the differences in extroversion across birth order groups to be statistically significant (F=3.92, p=.023).

These results support the hypothesis that birth order, mediated by parental treatment, has a significant correlation with extroversion and introversion. Youngest and middle children, experiencing more lenient parenting, tend to be more extroverted. Eldest children, with stricter discipline and higher expectations, often tend towards introversion. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and further explore the causal mechanisms behind them.

In summary, this essay has presented research on the connections between birth order, personality, and parental treatment. Descriptive statistics and ANOVA results from a small survey study indicate a significant relationship between birth order and extroversion, potentially due to differences in how parents treat their children based on birth order. However, additional studies are needed to substantiate these findings and determine the direct effects of parental treatment on the personalities of first-born, middle, and last-born children.
