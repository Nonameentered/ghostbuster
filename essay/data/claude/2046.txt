The Brazilian Rural Extension and Technical Assistance System (CATI) faces several significant challenges in providing effective and sustainable extension services, especially to smallholder farmers and rural communities in Brazil. CATI was established in the 1980s to provide rural communities with technical assistance and help modernize Brazilian agriculture. However, CATI has struggled to fulfill this mandate due to budget constraints, an outdated top-down approach, and difficulties reaching small-scale farmers. 

CATI’s budget has declined significantly in recent decades, limiting its ability to provide services across Brazil’s large rural areas. Government funding for CATI has dropped over 60% since the 1990s, even as the number of family farmers has increased. The vast majority of CATI’s budget goes to salaries, infrastructure, and overhead costs, leaving little for actual extension programs and services. This lack of funding has led to a shortage of well-trained extension agents, limited resources to support extension programs, and an inability to adopt more participatory approaches that are tailored to local needs.

In addition to budget issues, CATI has relied on an outdated “technology transfer” model that adopts a top-down approach to serving farmers. This model focuses on transferring new technologies and knowledge from researchers to extension agents and then on to farmers. However, this linear approach often fails to consider farmers’ needs, knowledge, and local conditions. As a result, many of CATI’s recommendations and programs are not readily adopted by farmers. A more participatory approach, where farmers help shape and develop extension programs to suit their needs, could help address this issue. Adopting more participatory methods can also reduce costs by relying more on farmer knowledge and participation.

Finally, CATI struggles to serve smallholder farmers and family farmers, who make up over 70% of farmers in Brazil. Most small-scale farmers live in remote, isolated communities that are difficult for extension agents to reach. They also face greater resource constraints and different challenges than large commercial farmers. However, CATI’s programs have traditionally focused on servicing larger farms that produce commodity crops, rather than the diverse subsistence crops grown by smallholders. Targeting smallholders will require developing more localized extension programs, recruiting more agents from rural communities, and improving access in remote areas.

In summary, CATI faces budget constraints, an outdated approach, and challenges serving small-scale farmers—all of which limit its effectiveness and sustainability. Transitioning to more participatory methods, developing localized programs tailored to smallholders, and improving access in remote communities could help CATI better support rural livelihoods across Brazil. With nearly 5 million family farmers in Brazil, improving CATI is crucial to supporting this vulnerable population and achieving greater food security nationwide. Overall, by adopting more participatory, low-cost methods and directing more resources to small-scale farmers, CATI can work to fulfill its goal of providing effective and sustainable extension services to all of Brazil’s rural communities.
