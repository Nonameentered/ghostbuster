The ancient Greeks made several important contributions to medicine that influenced how they understood and responded to epidemic diseases. Three key ideas in ancient Greek medicine were the theory of humors, the distinction between acute and chronic diseases, and a belief in environmental determinism. These concepts shaped how the Athenians understood and responded to the Plague of Athens, as described by the historian Thucydides in his History of the Peloponnesian War.

The central theory in ancient Greek medicine was the theory of humors. The Greeks believed that the body contained four humors: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. When the humors were balanced, a person was healthy. But if they were out of balance, the person could become ill. The Greeks linked the four humors to the four elements (air, fire, earth, water) and four qualities (hot, cold, dry, wet). Treatments often aimed to restore balance through adjustments to diet, exercise, and environment.

The Greeks also distinguished between acute and chronic diseases. Acute diseases were sharp and brief, caused by an imbalance of humors. Chronic diseases were long-lasting or recurring. The Plague of Athens was viewed as an acute disease caused by an excess of bile and phlegm. Thucydides wrote that the plague originated from hot and wet environmental conditions that caused "an excess of bile" in people. Treatments aimed to counter the excess humors through purging of bile, bloodletting, and changes in diet.

The Greeks believed in environmental determinism: that the environment and geography could shape a population's health and character. The Athenians attributed the plague to the arrival of many people from the countryside who carried "unhealthy constitutions." Thucydides blamed the plague on the hot and crowded conditions within Athens's walls during the war, as well as the arrival of people from abroad. The treatments were not only aimed at balancing the humors within individuals but also improving the environment through fumigation, ventilation, and cleaning the city.

In summary, key ideas of humors, distinction of acute vs. chronic disease, and environmental determinism shaped how the ancient Greeks understood the causes of and responses to the Plague of Athens. The plague was viewed as an acute disease caused by an excess of humors arising from hot and crowded environmental conditions and new arrivals to the city. Treatments aimed to purge excess humors from individuals and improve the overall environment. These concepts from ancient Greek medicine influenced responses to this devastating epidemic disease.
