Here is a 500-word essay in response to the prompt:

Minor burns, defined as first- and second-degree burns affecting less than 10% of the total body surface area in adults, can typically be managed at home with appropriate care and follow-up. The goals of care for minor burns are to prevent infection, promote healing, manage pain, and minimize scarring. 

Controversy exists around the management of blisters that form from minor burns. Traditionally, intact blisters were left unopened to reduce the risk of infection and promote healing. However, some studies have found that draining intact blisters under sterile conditions does not increase the risk of infection and may provide pain relief and enhanced mobility. If blisters are unopened, they will generally reabsorb within 1-2 weeks. Popped blisters require regular dressing changes to prevent infection until healed.

The use of prophylactic oral antibiotics for minor burns is also controversial. While antibiotics may reduce infection rates, they also risk side effects and promoting antibiotic resistance. For most minor burns that are properly cared for, the risk of infection is low. However, oral antibiotics may be considered for more severe burns, those in high-risk areas like the hands or face, in young children or older adults, or for people with co-morbidities like diabetes that increase infection risk. If signs of infection develop, antibiotics should be started as soon as possible. 

Proper follow-up care and pain management are essential for minor burns. Burns should be rechecked in 2-3 days by a doctor to check for signs of infection and ensure proper healing. Pain relievers, aloe gel, moist wound dressings and over-the-counter creams can help manage pain from minor burns. anti-inflammatory medications may also be helpful. If pain is not adequately controlled with home treatments, prescription medication may be needed.

In summary, minor burns can be safely managed at home for most patients with proper care. Controversy remains around the ideal treatment approaches for blisters and the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Close follow-up with a doctor and effective pain management are essential for promoting healing and minimizing complications. With appropriate care and time, most minor burns will heal without significant scarring or loss of function.
