Here is a 500 word essay on the process for controlling a 7-segment LED display with a Mitsubishi M16 microcontroller and IER Embedded Workbench:

To control a 7-segment LED display with a Mitsubishi M16 microcontroller, the following steps are required:

1. Set up the hardware. Connect the 7-segment display to the microcontroller. The display has 7 lines that correspond to 7 segments, as well as a common pin. Each line should be connected to its own digital output pin on the microcontroller. The common pin should be connected to ground. Provide power to the display circuit. 

2. Configure IER Embedded Workbench. Launch the software and create a new project for the M16 controller. Select the exact microcontroller model. Then add a 7-segment LED display component to represent the physical display in the circuit. Connect the pins from the virtual display to the correct digital output pins on the microcontroller, matching the actual hardware setup.

3. Write the code to send data to the display. In the code, declare 7 variables to represent each of the 7 lines on the display. For example, use variables named a through g. Then in a continuous loop, set the values of those variables to either 1 or 0 based on the shape you want to display. For example, to show a '5', set a, f, g, c, and d to 1, and b and e to 0. 

4. Use the .OUT directive to send the data. After the variables are set to the correct pattern, use 7 .OUT directives to send each variable to its corresponding digital output pin. For example, .OUT a, .OUT b, .OUT c, and so on. This will activate the necessary segments to show the desired shape.

5. Repeat and add delays. Put the entire sequence of setting the variables, sending with .OUT, and a short delay in a loop so that the shape continues to be displayed. Use incremental delays to control how fast the shapes change or alternate.

With some additional code to cycle through numbers, letters, and symbols, this process can be used to display messages and information on a 7-segment LED attached to a Mitsubishi M16 microcontroller. The key steps are properly wiring the hardware, configuring the software, coding the patterns for each shape, sending the data with .OUT commands, and adding necessary delays.
