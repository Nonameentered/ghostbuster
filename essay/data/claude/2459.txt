Shinfield Farm is a large dairy operation located in Berkshire, England with approximately 780 milking cows. The farm maintains a herd of Holstein Friesian cows that are milked three times per day in a modern rotary milking parlor. The cows are housed indoors in a free-stall barn and groups of 230 cows are milked at a time in a 50-stall milking parlor over the course of 20-25 minutes. The milking parlor uses automatic milking equipment to maximize efficiency and throughput. 

The cows at Shinfield Farm follow a total mixed ration feeding program, meaning they receive a blended diet of forages, grains, proteins, and minerals in a mixed ration. The diet is formulated by nutritionists to provide a balanced diet for high milk production. The cows have constant access to high-quality forages like grass silage, corn silage, and alfalfa hay. They also receive a grain concentrate and mineral supplements. The feeding system uses feed alleys and bunkers to provide total mixed rations, allowing 24-hour access to feed. The mixed ration feeding approach helps maximize dry matter intake to support the high milk yields of Holstein cows.

To increase milk production at Shinfield Farm, I would suggest three potential modifications to the current feeding system. First, more frequent feeding of grain concentrates could boost energy intake and milk yield. Currently, the cows receive a total mixed ration with a grain concentrate, but additional concentrates provided during milking could increase energy intake, particularly for the highest-producing cows. Multiple concentrates feedings have been shown to increase milk yield by over 10% in some studies. 

Second, replacing some corn silage with brown midrib (BMR) corn silage or sorghum silage could improve fiber digestibility and milk fat yield. BMR corn silage has been shown to improve milk fat production due to its more digestible fiber. Sorghum silage can also have over 10% greater fiber digestibility than normal corn silage. Increasing milk fat concentration and yield would significantly boost the overall milk production of the herd. 

Finally, supplementing with rumen-protected methionine could help mitigate a deficiency in metabolizable methionine, a key amino acid for milk protein synthesis. Many dairy rations are deficient in metabolizable methionine, which can limit milk protein concentration and yield. Rumen-protected methionine supplements are coated to withstand rumen degradation, providing methionine that can be absorbed in the small intestine and used for milk protein production. Supplementing with rumen-protected methionine could increase milk protein yield and overall milk volume.

In summary, the operation at Shinfield Farm utilizes modern equipment and facilities to maximize the milking efficiency of its high-producing Holstein herd. Modifications to the feeding system, including more frequent concentrate feeding, use of more digestible forages like BMR corn silage or sorghum silage, and supplementing rumen-protected methionine could provide key nutritional advantages to further boost milk yield and overall productivity. Implementing modifications to improve cow nutrition and metabolism would help Shinfield farm gain a competitive advantage in the dairy industry.
