Here is a draft 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

The meaning of language, whether in the form of statements, questions, commands, or other utterances, is deeply connected to the conditions under which that language is true or felicitous. For statements, the truth conditions specify when a statement accurately represents the world. For questions and commands, felicity conditions determine when an utterance successfully achieves the desired effect, such as requesting or conveying information in the case of a question, or causing an action to be performed for a command. 

While truth and felicity conditions are necessary for determining meaning, they are not always sufficient. Questions and commands, in particular, often rely on pragmatic inferences and shared cultural understandings that extend beyond their literal semantics. Consider a command like “Make me a sandwich.” To fully understand this command, one must understand not just that it requests the action of sandwich-making, but also pragmatic features like the authority relationship between speaker and listener, the context in which such a request would be appropriate, and probable speaker intentions or desires. The felicity conditions—that the listener has the ability and materials to make a sandwich and that the speaker actually wants a sandwich made—do not capture all this pragmatic depth.

For questions, the role of pragmatics in meaning is even more significant. Take the question “Can you pass the salt?” On the surface, this question seems to be a straightforward request for information about the listener’s ability to pass the salt shaker. But often, such a question pragmatically functions as an indirect request, not just for information but for the action itself. The felicity conditions of a question like this—that the listener understands the question and has access to the information to answer it—do not reflect the full pragmatically-enriched meaning.

In some cases, a focus only on truth or felicity conditions can even lead to misunderstandings of meaning. If taken purely literally, the command “Make me a sandwich” suggests the listener has an obligation to make the speaker a sandwich whenever requested. But culturally, we understand such commands as requests, not obligations, and so recognize that context and pragmatic features must inform meaning. Questions used as indirect requests provide another potential source of confusion if interpreted based solely on their semantics.

In conclusion, while truth and felicity conditions are necessary components of meaning, they are not always sufficient. A full understanding of the meaning of questions, commands, and other utterances relies also on pragmatic reasoning and inference, as well as cultural and contextual knowledge. A virtually infinite number of meanings can emerge from creative and context-dependent language use in a way that goes beyond objective conditions of truth and felicity. Meaning derives from the rich and unbounded complexities of human communication in the real world.
