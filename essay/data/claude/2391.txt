Here is a 999-word essay in response to the prompt:

There are several proposed mechanisms that can explain the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The first is complementarity, which refers to how species that are functionally distinct can utilize resources in different ways and occupy different niches, thereby enhancing overall resource use and productivity. For example, plant species with different root lengths and growth forms can exploit water and nutrients at different soil depths, leading to greater total resource capture.  

The second mechanism is the selection effect, which suggests that the presence of multiple species increases the chance that at least one high-functioning, fast-growing species will be present to dominate resources. This can enhance ecosystem functioning, at least in the short term. For example, in grassland ecosystems with many grass species, the species that is best adapted to local environmental conditions and available resources may outcompete the others, leading to high productivity.

A third mechanism is the facilitation effect, which occurs when the presence of one species directly benefits another, increasing its survival, growth, or fecundity. For example, nitrogen-fixing plants can increase the availability of nitrogen for other plants. Facilitation can enhance diversity and ecosystem functioning.

While much research has focused on these biodiversity mechanisms, other important environmental factors have received less attention. One is resource heterogeneity, or the diversity of resources in an ecosystem such as water, nutrients, light, and space. More heterogeneous environments provide more niches for species to exploit, enhancing complementarity. Heterogeneous environments also make it more likely that high-functioning species suited to local conditions will be present, strengthening the selection effect. 

Another understudied factor is resource aggregation, or the clumping and patchiness of resources. When resources are more aggregated, species interactions become more important. Clustering of resources can facilitate both competition between species but also beneficial interactions like facilitation. Resource aggregation may strengthen both complementarity and facilitation effects. 

In summary, complementarity, selection effects, and facilitation are thought to drive the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship. However, environmental factors like resource heterogeneity and aggregation can strongly impact these mechanisms and deserve more research attention. A more complete understanding of how these additional factors influence biodiversity effects can help in conserving biodiversity and maintaining healthy, productive ecosystems.
