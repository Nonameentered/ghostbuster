How Tourism Companies Can Effectively Utilize ICT to Maximize their Distribution Channels

Tourism companies today have a variety of distribution channels available to them to sell their products and services, thanks to advancements in information and communication technologies (ICT). Three of the major distribution channels that tourism companies can utilize are:

1. Direct online sales via company website: Tourism companies can develop their own website to directly market and sell their travel products to customers. For a scuba diving travel package, the company can provide all the relevant details about the trip on their website, allow customers to book and pay directly on the site. This allows the company to have full control over the user experience, marketing message, and customer data. However, the company needs to invest in developing and maintaining the website, e-commerce capabilities, and online security. 

2. Online travel agencies (OTAs): Tourism companies can list their scuba diving travel packages on third-party websites like Expedia, Booking.com, and TripAdvisor to access their large customer bases. This allows companies to outsource the cost and effort of developing technology infrastructure and managing online bookings and payments. However, companies have limited control over how their packages are presented on these websites and have to share a portion of their revenue with the OTAs. There is also a risk of commoditization if too many competitors are selling similar packages.

3. Traditional travel agencies: Tourism companies can also sell their scuba diving packages through traditional brick-and-mortar travel agencies, who then resell to customers. This allows companies to leverage the established client base and expertise of travel agents. However, the supply chain is longer, and companies have to share revenue with both travel agents and wholesale operators. There is also a risk of inconsistency in how products are sold and a lack of targeted marketing.  

In conclusion, while there are advantages and disadvantages to each distribution channel, to maximize reach, tourism companies should consider a multi-channel strategy that integrates direct online sales, major OTAs as well as traditional travel agencies. An effective multi-channel strategy, supported by a robust ICT infrastructure, will allow companies to gain access to the widest range of customers, reach target segments that prefer different channels, and build a competitive advantage through differentiated products and experiences. The choice of channels and the priority assigned to each channel also depends on the companyâ€™s business model, target customers, and available resources. With the rise of digital connectivity, tourism companies should aim to develop innovative ways to provide the best possible user experience across all platforms to thrive.
