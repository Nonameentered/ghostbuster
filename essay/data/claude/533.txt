Here is a 1250 word essay on the extent to which John Maynard Keynes aligned with classical or neoclassical economic schools:

John Maynard Keynes was one of the most influential economists of the 20th century. His economic theories have fundamentally shaped modern macroeconomic thought and policies. However, Keynes' perspectives differed in key ways from the mainstream classical and neoclassical economic schools that dominated prior to the Great Depression. 

Classical economists like Adam Smith and David Ricardo focused on the idea that free markets would lead to full employment as supply and demand came into equilibrium. They believed that the economy was self-regulating and that government intervention should be minimal. The neoclassical school that followed built on these notions, developing theories around utility maximization and general equilibrium. Like the classical economists, neoclassical theorists argued that the economy would stabilize at full employment through market mechanisms.

Keynes rejected many of the central tenets of classical and neoclassical economics. He did not believe that the economy was naturally self-regulating or that it would necessarily stabilize at full employment. Rather, he argued that the economy could stabilize at equilibrium points below full employment, leaving willing workers unemployed. This possibility of recession and joblessness led Keynes to advocate for a larger role for government policy to stabilize the economy. 

In his influential work The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, Keynes argued against the classical notion that supply creates its own demand. He posited instead that aggregate demand from consumption and investment drives economic growth. When demand falls short, it can lead to recession and job loss. Keynes advocated for countercyclical monetary and fiscal policy, including government spending and tax cuts, to boost aggregate demand during economic downturns. This was in direct contrast to the non-interventionist policies recommended by classical economists.

Keynes also rejected the neoclassical focus on individual agents and argued instead that macro-level forces shape the economy. He believed that investment depended on business confidence and expectations about the future, which were unstable and couldn't be modeled at the individual level. The "animal spirits" of businessmen could drive both economic booms and busts. Government policy was needed to counteract these destabilizing forces. 

In conclusion, while Keynes shared some theoretical perspectives with classical and neoclassical economists, including a belief in private enterprise and market pricing mechanisms, his views differed in substantial and important ways. Keynes advocated for countercyclical government policy to stabilize the macroeconomy in contrast with the non-interventionist policies typically recommended by the classical and neoclassical schools. His work shaped the 20th century shift toward more active government management of the economy at the macro level. Overall, Keynes' economic thought aligned more with the new school of macroeconomics he helped develop than with either the classical or neoclassical traditions that dominated prior to the Great Depression.
