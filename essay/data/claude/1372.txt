Here is a 500 word essay in response to the prompt:

The Western rights framework is inherently anthropocentric, built on understandings of natural rights given to humans as rational and moral beings. Extending this framework to include nonhuman entities requires reconciling this anthropocentrism with recognizing inherent value in nature beyond human interests. A "weak anthropocentric" approach that balances human interests with living in harmony with nature may offer a path forward.  

Western civilization is built on a model of human dominion over nature that enables exploitation. Natural rights are given to humans alone based on our rationality and morality. To grant rights to nonhumans requires undoing the conception of nature as purely instrumental to human interests. We must see intrinsic value in nonhuman life and natural systems beyond resources for human use.

The language of rights may be insufficient here, as rights imply reciprocity and shared social understanding between rights-holders. Nonhuman entities cannot claim or understand rights in this way. An environmental rationale that sees humans as part of interdependent natural systems, not distinct from or above them, is better suited to motivate preservationist policies. We must understand human interests as aligned with, not opposed to, the interests of nonhuman nature.

However, the Western tradition cannot be wholly discarded. A "weak anthropocentric" approach balances human interests with environmental priorities. It understands humans as part of nature, but recognizes the unique rational and moral value of human existence. Weak anthropocentrism sees human thriving as dependent on natural thriving, not as mutually exclusive. It motivates sustainability and preservation based on enlightened understanding of human interests, not in spite of them.

With this approach, human rights and dignity are reconciled with environmental protection through the understanding that the former depend on the latter. Rights can be given to nature not through impossible claims that nonhumans assert or understand rights, but through policies that recognize inherent value in natural systems and restrict human activities that threaten them, thereby securing the human interest in a livable future. Weak anthropocentrism may offer the most promising path to build an ecological rights framework in the Western tradition. By balancing human priorities with environmental responsibilities, it underscores human dependence on the nonhuman world and motivates preservation of natural life not as a self-sacrifice but an act of self-interest and a fulfillment of human dignity on an sustainable planet.
