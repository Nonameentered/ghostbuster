Here is a 742-word essay in response to the prompt:

As sources of fossil fuels deplete and climate change intensifies in the coming decades, most experts agree that 'business as usual' is not an option for meeting global energy needs. Achieving energy sustainability will require a combination of comprehensive strategies, policy changes, advances in technology, and adaptation to renewable energy sources. 

Nuclear power is one possible long-term solution that could help address both energy security and climate change. Unlike fossil fuels, nuclear energy does not emit greenhouse gases and produces large amounts of baseload power. Many existing nuclear plants have operated safely for decades and new reactor designs focus on safety, efficiency, and waste reduction. However, nuclear faces significant challenges including cost, waste management concerns, and proliferation risks that would need to be addressed for it to expand substantially.

Alternatively, expanding renewable energy sources like solar and wind offers a carbon-free path to greater energy sustainability that avoids the issues around nuclear. Solar and wind have seen drastic cost reductions in recent years and continue to get cheaper, competitive with fossil fuels. However, they are intermittent and energy storage solutions would be needed to provide baseload power. A large-scale transition to renewables would also require massive investments to upgrade transmission infrastructure and adopt smart grid technology. 

For the next 100 years, here is a possible timeline:

2020s: Policies support growth of renewables. Paris Accord targets for emissions reductions take effect. Some existing nuclear plants see licenses extended. Carbon tax or cap and trade adopted in major economies.

2030s: Renewables reach over 50% of global electricity. Policies ban sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles. Next-gen nuclear reactors come online. Carbon capture technologies implemented. 

2040s: Most coal plants shut down in Western nations. Solar and wind costs drop below that of natural gas. Used fuel from nuclear is reprocessed and reused. Hydrogen for energy storage is produced at scale.

2050s: Developing nations transition from coal to renewables and next-gen nuclear. Fusion reactors achieve net energy gain. Carbon emissions peak and begin to decline.

2060s-2070s: Global energy mix is over 80% renewable and nuclear. Most transportation is electric and autonomous. Widespread use of microgrids and home battery systems. Fusion reactors deployed commercially.

2080s-2100: Nearly all global energy comes from non-emitting sources. Remaining fossil fuels used for chemical feedstocks and industrial processes. Fusion and next-gen fission provide baseload power. Carbon emissions at 80-95% below 2020 levels.

With a concerted global effort across governments, businesses, and citizens over the next century, a transition to sustainable energy is challenging but feasible. By shifting to renewable and nuclear energy, upgrading infrastructure, and deploying new technologies as they are developed, we can achieve a low-carbon future and energy for all. Overall, there are paths forward, but the next few decades are critical. Our actions today will shape the energy system of tomorrow.
