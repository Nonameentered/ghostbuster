There are several different systems and techniques used commercially to produce eggs for human consumption. The most common systems are cage systems, barn systems, and free-range systems. In cage systems, hens are housed individually in cages, usually made of wire mesh. The cages are typically stacked on top of each other. This system is the most economical in terms of capital requirements and productivity. However, there are significant animal welfare concerns with this intensive system as hens have very limited space and are unable to express natural behaviors. 

Barn systems house hens in larger enclosures, either on multiple levels or on a single level. They provide more space for hens and typically include nesting boxes, perches, and scratching areas. This allows for better animal welfare as hens are able to move around more freely and express some natural behaviors. However, barn systems require higher capital investment and typically have lower productivity than cage systems.

Free-range systems provide the most space and best conditions for animal welfare. Hens have access to outdoor ranges as well as housing. They have ample space to roam, express natural behaviors, and lay eggs in nesting boxes. However, free-range systems typically have the lowest productivity and highest costs due to lower hen density, higher feed costs, and more difficult management.

For the UK market, a balance needs to be struck between animal welfare demands, consumer preferences, economic efficiency, and environmental impact. On balance, a barn system is likely the most appropriate for the majority of egg producers in the UK. Barn systems can achieve reasonably high productivity and still meet higher welfare standards by providing more space and opportunities for natural behaviors compared to cage systems. They are also more economically efficient than most free-range systems while still meeting consumer demand for more ethically and sustainably produced eggs. Some free-range systems should still exist in the UK to meet demand for premium, organic, and cruelty-free eggs. But for the bulk of egg production, barn systems achieve the optimal balance of welfare, economic, environmental, and consumer interests. Overall, the UK egg industry should aim for a diversity of systems to match the diversity of consumer needs. But barn systems likely deserve to dominate in order to achieve a sustainable and ethical model of egg production at scale.
