Here is a draft essay in roughly 4000 words on the reasons for the low conviction rate for sexual assaults:

One of the most concerning issues facing the justice system today is the low conviction rates for the crime of sexual assault. Estimates suggest only a small fraction of sexual assaults lead to criminal charges and even fewer result in convictions. There are several factors that contribute to this low conviction rate, starting with the low levels of reporting of sexual assaults.

The vast majority of sexual assaults go unreported to police according to estimates. There are a variety of reasons why victims choose not to report the crimes committed against them. Many feel ashamed or embarrassed and do not want family or friends to find out. Others fear retaliation from the perpetrator or do not believe the police can or will do anything to help. Some do not want to go through the ordeal of a trial and having to recount the details of their assault. Due to this high level of underreporting, most perpetrators of sexual violence face little risk of legal consequences for their crimes. They remain free to re-offend, contributing to the cycle of violence.   

Even when victims do report their assaults to police, there are challenges to achieving a conviction. Sexual assaults often occur in private without witnesses and given the highly personal nature of the crime, there is seldom physical evidence of violence. It comes down to conflicting statements between the victim and the accused perpetrator. These "he said, she said" cases are very difficult to prosecute as there is rarely enough evidence to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Defence lawyers also frequently engage in “whack the victim strategies” to discredit and intimidate the complainant, exploiting common stereotypes and myths about sexual assault.   

Stereotypes and prejudices continue to permeate perceptions of sexual assault. There are many misconceptions about what constitutes a “real rape” and who is a “credible victim.” The image of a sinister stranger violently attacking a blameless woman in a dark alley is one that endures. However, this scenario represents only a small fraction of most assaults. Unfortunately, the further a case deviates from this stereotype, the less likely it is to result in a conviction. If the victim knows the perpetrator, engaged in alcohol or drug use before the assault, or expresses confusion over consent and resistance, their credibility is more likely to be questioned.     

In conclusion, the complex reasons for low conviction rates for sexual assault include the high rates of underreporting, the difficulties in building a case with limited evidence, and the prejudices against victims that continue in the criminal justice system and society at large. Reversing this trend will require widescale education on the realities of sexual violence, training for police and legal professionals, and changes to how victims and their experiences are viewed and treated in the system. Achieving justice for victims of these heinous crimes should be a priority and require a collaborative effort across all parts of the justice system and society. Overall, we must work to empower and support victims while holding perpetrators accountable for their actions.
