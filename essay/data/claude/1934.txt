"There are several good reasons to examine a biological slide briefly under a lower magnification power before proceeding to the high power oil immersion objective. Low power scanning allows you to determine the structure and distribution of cells in the specimen. You can see the overall tissue arrangement and the sizes of individual cells, which helps to distinguish different types of cells and tissues. For example, you can distinguish the large cells of an animal compared to the smaller cells of a plant or bacterium. The low power view also helps in finding specific areas of interest, such as particular cell types or tissues for further examination. This minimizes searching in vain for these targets when switched to the high power objective.

Another benefit of examining the slide first under low power magnification is that it allows you to estimate the size and placement of intracellular structures and molecules, such as organelles, inclusions, and protein deposits. These estimates help in determining appropriate stain concentrations and incubation times for certain stains and in interpreting the final observations under oil immersion. For example, if the estimated protein granule size is 1-2 micrometers, a stain with 0.5 micrometer stain particles may provide optimal resolution and color intensity. At low power, the relationship between intracellular structures can also be determined, which provides context for high power observations.   

Asexual reproduction in bacteria and yeast are two distinct processes. In bacteria, asexual reproduction occurs through binary fission, in which a single bacterial cell divides into two identical daughter cells. The bacterial cell elongates, replicates its DNA, and divides its cytoplasm into two equal parts, with one set of genetic material in each new cell. In contrast, yeast reproduce asexually through budding. The yeast cell forms a smaller bud that develops into a fully separated daughter cell. The daughter cell receives nutrients and organelles from the parent cell during formation of the bud.  

The sporangium and conidium are two different asexual reproductive structures. A sporangium is an enclosure in fungi that contains haploid spores. The sporangium develops from fungal hyphae and releases the spores, which then germinate into hyphae. In contrast, a conidium is an asexual spore that develops at the end of a specialized fungal hypha called a conidiophore. Conidia are exposed at maturity and readily become dispersed, whereas sporangia contain spores within an enclosure until maturity and release. Thus, the two structures differ in their development, morphology, and method of spore dispersal."
