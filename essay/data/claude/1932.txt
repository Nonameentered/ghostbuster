Here is a 1750-word essay response to the prompt:

Lastminute.com launched in the UK in 1998 as an online marketplace for distressed inventory of travel, accommodation and leisure activities across a number of suppliers. The company adopted a product orientation in its early years, focusing on developing a wide range of last-minute deals that offered significant discounts to customers. The company's value proposition was built around providing customers with access to heavily discounted time-sensitive offers across a range of travel and leisure categories. 

However, over time Lastminute.com has shifted to a marketing orientation to drive growth. Several factors have influenced this transition. Firstly, the number of competitor sites offering similar last-minute deals has increased substantially. This has reduced Lastminute.com's competitive advantage from being an early mover in the space. Secondly, customers have become more sophisticated in their purchasing behavior. The novelty of accessing last-minute deals has worn off, and customers now expect more personalized and curated offers. Finally, suppliers have become more adept at controlling inventory and distributing excess capacity through a range of channels. This has reduced the volume of distressed inventory available to Lastminute.com.

In response, Lastminute.com has adapted its marketing mix to build stronger customer relationships and meet changing needs. It has invested heavily in its customer data and analytics capabilities to gain a single view of customers across channels and understand behavior in more depth. This allows Lastminute.com to provide personalized product recommendations and more targeted communications to customers. The company has also expanded its product range beyond just last-minute deals to include a broader range of full-price offerings across more travel and leisure categories. This provides customers with more choice and a reason to keep returning to the Lastminute.com marketplace.

Lastminute.com's shift to a marketing orientation has been instrumental to its continued success. By gaining a deeper understanding of customers, diversifying its product range, and delivering more personalized and relevant customer experiences, Lastminute.com has been able to strengthen its brand and build long-term customer loyalty despite increasing competition. Its transition from a product-centric to customer-centric business model has enabled Lastminute.com to meet the evolving needs of customers and stay ahead of competitors. Overall, the move to a marketing orientation has provided a solid foundation for future growth.
