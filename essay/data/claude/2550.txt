There are several advantages and disadvantages to using maize silage compared to grass silage as the main feed for finishing beef cattle. Maize silage, also known as corn silage, is made from mature corn plants that are harvested, chopped, and then ensiled. Grass silage is made from grass crops like ryegrass, timothy grass or red clover. While maize silage tends to result in faster growth rates and larger final carcass sizes, grass silage can produce beef with some desirable characteristics like increased marbling and tenderness.

One of the main advantages of maize silage is that it provides highly digestible, energy-dense feed for cattle. A study comparing Angus cross steers fed either maize silage or grass silage found that steers on the maize silage diet had an average daily gain of 1.4 kg/day, compared to 1.1 kg/day for those on grass silage. The increased energy and starch in maize silage likely contributed to this higher growth rate. The maize silage-fed steers were also 56 kg heavier at slaughter. For beef producers, this can translate into getting cattle to market weight in less time, increasing productivity and profitability.   

However, there are some downsides to the rapid growth promoted by maize silage. Beef from maize silage-fed cattle tends to be less marbled and less tender. The previously mentioned study found that steers fed maize silage had beef with lower marbling scores (3.1 vs 4.2 for grass silage) and higher shear force values (4.9 kg vs 4.2 kg for grass silage), indicating less tender meat. Slower growth on grass silage seems to allow more time for fat deposition and connective tissue breakdown. Many consumers prefer more marbled, tender beef, so grass silage may have an advantage for producing a premium product.

Another disadvantage of maize silage is that it requires more inputs to produce. Maize silage needs nitrogen fertilizer to achieve maximum yields, while many grass crops can produce satisfactory yields with little or no additional fertilizer. Maize also typically requires more intensive tillage, irrigation, and pest control. The environmental impacts from production, like nitrate leaching and carbon emissions, would therefore likely be greater for maize silage. In areas where grass growth is abundant and input costs are high, grass silage may be more economically and environmentally sustainable.  

In conclusion, while maize silage does have significant benefits for rapid beef production, grass silage is a viable alternative with some advantages for beef quality and reduced inputs. For finishing beef cattle, a mix of both maize and grass silages could help achieve maximum growth rates while also producing a premium, highly marbled beef product. The ideal mix for any operation would depend on local conditions, available feeds, and the desired characteristics of the final beef. With the use of both silages, producers can maximize the advantages of each to achieve a balance of high productivity and product quality.
