The dietary reference values (DRV) were established by the Scientific Committee for Food of the EU, and they represent the amount of energy and nutrients recommended for groups of people and populations in the UK. The DRV include the estimated average requirement (EAR), the recommended daily amount (RDA), and adequate intake (AI) for both macronutrients and micronutrients. According to a study that evaluated the dietary intake of 400 university students in the UK using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), the dietary intake of both male and female students generally meets the DRV for macronutrients but fails to meet the recommendations for some micronutrients. 

Male students in particular struggle to meet the DRV for fiber, vitamin D, folate, and certain minerals like iron, zinc, and magnesium. Excessive intake of energy, saturated fat, sugar, and sodium paired with inadequate intake of the aforementioned micronutrients can have detrimental health effects. Excess energy and saturated fat intake can lead to weight gain and increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic illnesses. Inadequate fiber, folate, and mineral intake are associated with digestive issues, anemia, impaired immune function, and cognitive decline.

To improve their dietary intake, male students should increase their consumption of whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds to boost fiber and mineral intake; fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified foods to increase vitamin D and folate intake; and more lean meats, eggs, lentils, and leafy green vegetables to boost iron and zinc intake. Students should also limit intake of processed foods, red meat, full-fat dairy, and sugary beverages. Portion control and home cooking are effective strategies for consuming a balanced and nutritious diet.

There are some potential errors and limitations to consider with the FFQ. Firstly, the FFQ relies on the participants' memory and accurate self-reporting of food intake, which can be subject to recall bias. The FFQ also provides only a snapshot of diet at a single point in time and may not capture habitual diet or seasonal variations. Portion size estimation using the FFQ can be challenging for participants and lead to over- or under-reporting of dietary intake. The FFQ has a limited list of foods and food groups and may miss some dietary components. Despite these limitations, the FFQ can still be useful in ranking individuals by intake level and for examining the relationship between diet and health outcomes in large population studies.

In summary, while university students in the UK generally meet the DRV for macronutrients, many male students struggle to meet the recommendations for key micronutrients like fiber, vitamin D, folate, iron, zinc, and magnesium according to a FFQ survey. To improve dietary intake and support health, male students should aim to consume more whole foods like grains, nuts, fatty fish, lean meats as well as fortified foods and less processed options with portion control. The FFQ used to assess dietary intake has some limitations around accuracy and completeness, but it can still provide useful insights into broad dietary patterns and nutritional deficiencies prevalent in groups and populations.
