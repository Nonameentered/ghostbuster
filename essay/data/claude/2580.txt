The objective of the experiment to determine the reducing sugar content of Jam is to quantitatively analyze the amount of reducing sugars, such as glucose and fructose, present in the sample of jam. Reducing sugars have the ability to act as reducing agents by donating hydrogen atoms. The materials required for this experiment include the sample of jam, Benedict's reagent (which contains cupric citrate complex ions), a burette, pipettes, flasks, a hot plate, deionized water, and a starch indicator. 

To determine the reducing sugar content, first, a sample of jam should be obtained for analysis. A mixture of the sample and deionized water should be prepared in a flask to make a solution that is approximately 1% sugar by mass. Benedict's reagent is a blue solution of cupric citrate complex ions. When mixed with reducing sugars and heated, the cupric ions are reduced to cuprous ions, resulting in the precipitation of cuprous oxide, which causes the solution to turn green, yellow, or red-orange, depending on the amount of reducing sugar.

A measured volume of the 1% jam solution is transferred to a flask using a pipette. An excess amount of Benedict's reagent is added to the flask. The solution is then heated for a few minutes. If reducing sugars are present, the solution will become green, yellow, or red-orange, depending on the concentration of reducing sugar. The starch indicator is used to help determine the endpoint of the reaction more easily. The titration is done by slowly adding the 1% jam solution from the burette to the flask until the solution turns red-orange. The volume of jam solution used corresponds to the reducing sugar present. The reducing sugar content is directly proportional to the volume of solution used. From the titration results, the concentration of reducing sugar in the jam sample can be calculated. 

In summary, through the procedure of titration with Benedict's reagent and using starch indicator, we can determine and quantify the amount of reducing sugars present in the sample of jam. The materials, indicators, and observations of color change provide an easy experimental method for this type of quantitative analysis.
