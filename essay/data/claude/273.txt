Lord Alfred Thompson Denning, universally known as Lord Denning, was one of the most influential judges of the 20th century and had a profound impact on English law through his decisions and writings. One area where he had a particularly significant influence was on the rights of residential tenants and occupants. 

Traditionally, English law favored the rights of property owners over those actually occupying the property. The prevailing legal doctrine was that if someone was on another's land without their permission, they were considered a trespasser with very limited rights. Landowners had almost total discretion to remove trespassers or restrict their access. When it came to residential tenants, the law provided them some additional rights through legislation and common law, but still left landlords with considerable power over tenants and the terms of their occupancy.

Lord Denning helped rebalance the law to provide greater rights and protections for residential occupants, whether as tenants, licensees or even trespassers. One of the first major cases where he advanced the rights of tenants was in Errington v Errington in 1951. In that case, a couple had lived in a home provided by the husband's parents for over 20 years and made extensive improvements to the property. However, the house was conveyed to the couple through a mere license, leaving them without any legal interest in the property. When the parents sought to evict the couple, Lord Denning ruled that they had acquired an equitable interest in the property through their long possession and financial contributions. He stated that it would be inequitable for them to lose their home without compensation.  

Lord Denning followed a similar equitable reasoning in other cases involving long residential possession and occupation, such as Hussey v Palmer and Eves v Eves. He believed the law should protect the reasonable expectations of occupants and prevent the harsh forfeitures of homes and investments that would otherwise result. His rulings made it more difficult for property owners to evict residential occupants after long periods of possession, even without a proper lease or legal interest. 

Beyond tenancies and licenses, Lord Denning sought to provide greater rights even for those occupying property as trespassers. In McPhail v Persons, Lord Denning ruled that a squatter who had occupied a vacant council house for over 20 years could not be summarily evicted. He held that the long period of undisturbed possession and the squatter's substantial renovation of the property gave rise to certain equitable rights, even though as a trespasser he would normally have had none. While not giving the squatter a full legal interest in the property, Lord Denning found that basic fairness and justice required giving him more rights than an ordinary trespasser in order to protect his long home and investment.

Through decisions like these, Lord Denning eroded the traditional favoritism of English law towards the rights of property owners over residential occupants. He believed the law should protect the reasonable expectations that arise from long occupation and possession of a home, even without a proper legal title or interest. His innovative rulings established more equitable rights for tenants, licensees and even certain trespassers in residential property. Overall, Lord Denning had a profound impact on modernizing the rights of those in residential occupation and moving the law to a fairer and more progressive position.
