The classic two-slit experiment with photons has been expanded into modern variants that further probe the mysteries of quantum mechanics. In delayed-choice experiments, researchers manipulate the experimental setup after photons have passed through the slits to determine whether they behaved as particles or waves. Even after photons have traveled through space, their behavior depends on measurements made at the end. This suggests that quantum objects do not have defined properties independent of measurement.  

The two-slit experiment shows that photons can exhibit wave-like interference, even when fired one at a time. This counterintuitive behavior implies that single photons pass through both slits simultaneously and interfere with themselves. In the Copenhagen interpretation, photons exist in a superposition of states until measured. The act of measurement causes the superposition to collapse into a definite state. Other interpretations like the de Broglieâ€“Bohm theory suggest that photons have definite particle trajectories but are guided by a wavefunction.

The explanation for the two-slit experiment lies in the wave-particle duality. Quantum objects have properties of both particles and waves. A single photon acts as a particle when emitted and detected but behaves like a wave propagating through both slits. When detected on a screen, the wavefunction collapses at a spot, but the interference pattern emerges over many photons. 

The two-slit experiment poses deep questions about the nature of reality and our ability to describe it. Do photons exist independent of measurement? Does consciousness cause the collapse of the wavefunction? The experiment highlights the strangeness of quantum behavior and suggests limits to scientific knowledge and human intuition about the workings of the universe. Overall, the two-slit experiment and its modern variants demonstrate the bizarre yet fascinating behavior of quantum objects.
