Here is a 500 word essay on the prompt:

An integrated farm takes a holistic approach to agriculture that is sustainable and environmentally-friendly. Rather than focusing on maximum yields of a single crop, an integrated farm cultivates a diverse range of plants and animals together in a symbiotic system. 

One key aspect of an integrated farm is crop rotation. Instead of planting the same crop in a field year after year, which can deplete the soil of nutrients, an integrated farm rotates between different crops. For example, a field may rotate between legumes like beans or peas, grains like wheat or oat, and leafy green crops. The different crops have different effects on the soil, whether fixing nitrogen, using different nutrients, or preventing pest and disease buildup. This makes the soil healthier and more productive.

Integrated farms also make use of natural pest control and fertilization methods. Rather than relying on chemical pesticides and fertilizers, the farm utilizes compost and manure to nourish the soil. It also encourages natural predators like ladybugs, birds, and bats to control pests. Planting diverse crops likewise prevents any one pest from destroying an entire harvest. These natural methods avoid polluting the air, water, and soil with toxic chemicals. 

Livestock are well integrated into the system. Animals graze on grass and leftover crop remains, then their manure is used as fertilizer. Chickens or ducks often forage in the fields, eating leftover grains and pest insects while also providing eggs and meat. The livestock provide natural sources for fertilizer, pest control, and food, strengthening the sustainability of the farm.

Though crop yields may be somewhat lower than industrial monocrops, an integrated farm is highly productive in its diversity of foods. It also promotes healthier soil, fewer pests and diseases, and a thriving ecosystem. By working with natural cycles rather than against them, integrated farms achieve sustainability through diversity, rotation, and natural processes. Overall, integrated farms represent an ecologically harmonious model for agriculture.
