Respiratory failure occurs when the respiratory system cannot provide adequate oxygenation of blood and removal of carbon dioxide from the body. In elderly patients, severe pneumonia is a common cause of respiratory failure. The diagnosis of respiratory failure requires measurement of oxygen saturation, arterial blood gases, and chest imaging.

Initially, oxygen saturation is measured using pulse oximetry. A reading of less than 90% indicates hypoxemia and the need for supplemental oxygen. Arterial blood gases show a low partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2 less than 60 mmHg) and possibly high partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2 greater than 45 mmHg), indicating inadequate ventilation and perfusion. Chest imaging like X-ray or CT scan will confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia and also check for complications like pleural effusion. 

The management of respiratory failure from pneumonia includes treatment of the underlying infection, improving oxygenation and ventilation, and addressing any complications. Antibiotic therapy should be started as soon as possible based on sputum culture results. Oxygen supplementation can be provided via nasal cannula, face mask, or in severe cases through mechanical ventilation like non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or invasive mechanical ventilation. Physiotherapy and respiratory treatments help clear secretions. IV fluids maintain hydration while electrolyte imbalances are corrected.

In the elderly, the underlying cause of severe pneumonia leading to respiratory failure could be aspiration of gastric contents, sequelae of COPD like bronchiectasis, or a compromised immune system. A detailed history, additional testing and evaluation by respiratory physicians may be needed to determine the underlying etiology.

The psychological impacts of respiratory failure and mechanical ventilation on the elderly include anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The patient and families worry about mortality and long hospitalization. Delirium is also common which causes further distress. Social implications include loss of independence and mobility, reduced social interactions, and the need for prolonged rehabilitation during recovery. Many patients require home oxygen therapy or nursing home placement after discharge before returning to their prior living arrangements.

In summary, respiratory failure in the elderly from severe pneumonia requires prompt diagnosis, management of hypoxemia and ventilation, treatment of infection, and addressing psychological and social needs to optimize outcomes and quality of life. A holistic, multidisciplinary approach focused on the needs of the geriatric patient will achieve the best results.
