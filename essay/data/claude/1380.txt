Substance Dualism is the philosophical theory that the mind and body are two fundamentally different substances. Substance Dualists believe that the mental realm and the physical realm are distinct and separate. The most famous proponent of Substance Dualism was the 17th-century French philosopher Rene Descartes. His formulation is known as Cartesian Dualism.  

According to Descartes, the mind and the body are composed of different substances—thought and extension, respectively. The mind is non-physical, thinking, and conscious, while the body is physical, unthinking, and spatial. The mind is indivisible, unitary, and un-extended, while the body is divisible into parts, made up of distinct components, and exists in space. Though Descartes argued that mind and body interact, he struggled to give a coherent account of how two substances so fundamentally different could causally influence one another.  

A key strength of Cartesian Dualism is that it gives a intuitively plausible account of the immateriality of the mind and consciousness. Our own experience suggests there is something fundamentally non-physical about our thoughts, perceptions, and inner experiences. Cartesian Dualism captures this sense that the mind is set apart from the physical world. It also explains why we have privileged access to our own minds—we directly experience our own consciousness in a way we do not directly experience physical objects.   

However, Cartesian Dualism faces significant challenges and objections. The primary weakness revolves around the issue of how the mental and physical realms can interact at all given how substantially different they are. Contemporary philosophers have found interactionist forms of Dualism difficult to make sense of given our modern scientific understanding of physics. There does not seem to be room for a non-physical mind to exert real influence in the physical world or vice versa.

Empirical evidence from psychology and neuroscience also challenges the notion that the mind is separate from the physical body. We now have scientific explanations for many aspects of the mind once thought to be fundamentally non-physical, such as emotions, memory, perception, and even consciousness. Damage to the physical brain can radically alter one's mental experiences and abilities. This suggests that the mind arises from and depends upon the physical processes of the brain.

In conclusion, while Cartesian Dualism provides an intuitively appealing account of the distinction between the mind and body, it faces substantial difficulties. There are reasons to be skeptical that the immaterial mind can interact with the physical body or that it exists independently of the physical processes that give rise to it. However, Dualism continues to find supporters who argue that consciousness in particular eludes physical explanation. The debate between Dualists and their critics remains an open and vibrant area of contemporary philosophy.
