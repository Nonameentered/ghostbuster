Here is a 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

The current English legal position on abortion is provided by the Abortion Act 1967, which allows for abortion on certain grounds. The Act permits abortion up until 24 weeks of pregnancy if two doctors agree that the continuation of the pregnancy would involve greater risk to the physical or mental health of the woman, or her existing children, than terminating the pregnancy. After 24 weeks, abortion is only allowed in cases of severe foetal abnormality or risk to the woman's life.

This framework fails to adequately consider the circumstances surrounding abortions for foetal disability. It applies a broad brushstroke by grouping all abortions after 24 weeks together, without acknowledging the range of disabilities and differing impacts on the pregnant woman and family. The disability can vary significantly in severity and prognosis, but the Act does not distinguish between them in its requirements. For instance, it does not consider abortions for life-limiting conditions separately from those for manageable disabilities. The lack of nuance results in an overly restrictive approach that can negatively impact women carrying foetuses with disabilities.

A rights-based approach, as adopted in American jurisprudence, could improve the balancing of interests in English law. In the US, the right to privacy under the constitution has been found to encompass a woman's choice to have an abortion. However, the state also has an interest in protecting prenatal life. To balance these competing interests, the courts in the US apply the undue burden test to assess the constitutionality of abortion restrictions. This test looks at whether a restriction has the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the foetus is viable. If so, it is deemed an undue burden and unconstitutional.   

Applying this rights-based undue burden test can introduce more nuance into English law. It would require considering the impact of restrictions on abortions for foetal disabilities on the pregnant woman and her rights. For instance, a total ban on post-24 week abortions in all cases of disability without exception for life-limiting conditions would likely fail the undue burden test as it places substantial obstacles in the path of women in such situations. The severity and prognosis of the disability, prospects of the foetus surviving for long, and impact on the woman would all be relevant to determine if the restriction poses an undue burden. 

A tailored approach is needed to govern abortions for foetal disability. Rather than broad restrictions, the law should account for individual circumstances and balance the rights and interests of all concerned based on factors like severity of condition, impact on life expectancy, quality of life, and physical/emotional harm to the woman. An undue burden standard as adopted in the US can guide a more nuanced framework in English law, upholding reproductive rights while protecting prenatal lives in appropriate cases. Overall, a rights-based approach with the undue burden test can instil more balance, nuance and equity into the legal position on abortions for foetal disability in England.
