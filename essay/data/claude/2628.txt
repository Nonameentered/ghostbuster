Joshua Pollard's post-processual approach to settlement archaeology of the Neolithic in the British Isles provides a broader perspective on social change during this era. His concepts of dwelling landscapes and inhabitation rhythms push against the scalar logic of processual archaeology, focusing on the lived experience at the site level rather than broader models of cultural evolution. Pollard's work at Neolithic sites such as Hambledon Hill, Dorset and Durrington Walls, Wiltshire reveal more nuanced dynamics of everyday life that shaped the Neolithic settlement pattern. 

Processual archaeology conceptualized the Neolithic transition in Britain as part of a broad process of cultural evolution and economic intensification, characterized by a shift from mobile hunter-gatherers to sedentary farmers. Sites were interpreted primarily in functional terms, to understand economic activities and environmental adaptation. In contrast, Pollard proposes the concept of ‘dwelling landscapes’ - considering sites not just as physical spaces for activities but also as meaningful, symbolically charged places for inhabitation. His post-processual approach focuses on the phenomenological experience of living at these sites and how inhabitation rhythms shape settlement patterns.

At Hambledon Hill, Pollard identifies an ‘chaîne opératoire’ or operational sequence of activities in the layout and usage of spaces that reflects symbolic and social logics, not just economic efficiency. The peculiar double-ditch enclosure, with restricted entrances, channelled visitors through transitional zones reflecting social hierarchies. Meticulous stratigraphic excavation revealed details of rhythms of activity, refuse disposal, and shifts in spatial organization over 200-300 years of use, suggesting the significance of habitus and daily practice in structuring space. 

Durrington Walls exhibits a similar symbolic and social logic in its organization. The arrangement of timber structures, open areas, depositional practices, and movement through the site reflect not just seasonal herd management but also important habitus and ritual behaviours underpinning society. The massive rebuilding of the site, aligning structures and creating formal avenues, indicate changes in the inhabitation rhythm and social order around 2500 BC.

In sum, Pollard’s post-processual approach to major Neolithic sites in Britain provides insight into the cultural logics and lived experiences underpinning settlement patterns and shifts. Focused on ‘dwelling’ and ‘inhabitation,’ Pollard reveals the symbolic and social mechanisms by which early agricultural societies organized space, structured daily life, and ultimately transformed themselves during the Neolithic period in Britain. His approach broadens understanding beyond economic adaptations and environmental drivers, giving us a glimpse into the cultural worldviews and habitus that shaped the Neolithic transition.
