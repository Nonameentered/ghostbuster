My Food Consumption and Cultural Identity 

Food is fundamental to human existence, but it is also a key aspect of cultural identity and expression. The foods I eat, how I eat them, and with whom I share them are all influenced by the cultural groups I belong to and help shape my sense of identity. At the same time, my food consumption habits can provide insights into cultural practices of the past and how societies have evolved.

I was born into an upper-middle class family in the Midwestern United States. My parents were both raised Catholic, though we were not particularly religious as a family. However, Catholic traditions and holidays shaped some of my earliest food memories, including fish fry dinners on Fridays during Lent and hearty Christmas Eve feasts. Another early influence was my mother’s German heritage. Although my mother only spoke English, she often made traditional German foods she learned from her grandmother like sauerbraten, spätzle, and apple strudel.

As a child, most of our family meals were homemade, and we ate together nearly every night. This practice of sharing home-cooked meals reflects the mid-20th century rise of the traditional family dinner in the U.S. and the post-World War II economic prosperity that allowed more women to stay home to cook. However, as my mother went back to work and life grew busier, we began to rely more on processed and convenience foods, a trend that aligned with rising dual-income households and the growth of big food companies. 

In my teenage years and as a young adult, my diet became more influenced by mainstream American culture. I regularly ate fast food, junk food, and sugary snacks. I bonded with friends over pizza, burgers, and milkshakes. However, as I entered my 30s, I developed an interest in healthier, more ethically and environmentally sustainable eating. I started following dietary practices like flexitarianism and reducitarianism, eating more plant-based, locally-sourced, and organic foods. This shift reflects the rise of the “conscious consumer” movement.

Looking at my own food experiences provides a glimpse into how American culture has changed over the decades. The foods I eat are a product of the ethnic traditions of my ancestors, the era I grew up in, the region I live in, my social class, and my own ethical values. At the same time, analyzing my eating habits at different life stages helps bring cultural food practices of the past into sharper focus. My story is just one example of the rich insights that can be gained by studying our complex relationships with food.
