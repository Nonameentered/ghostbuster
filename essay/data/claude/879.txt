Establishing a duty of care is a fundamental principle in tort law. It refers to the obligation of a person or organization to exercise a reasonable standard of care to avoid causing harm to others. Unless a duty of care can be established, negligence claims will fail. Duty of care impacts cases of negligent misstatement, where incorrect or misleading information is provided, as well as claims of pure economic loss.

For a negligence claim to succeed, the claimant must prove that the defendant owed them a duty of care. This means demonstrating that there was a relationship between the parties that required the defendant to meet a minimum standard of care to avoid causing foreseeable harm. The nature of the relationship, such as between a doctor and patient or business and customer, gives rise to the duty. Without this duty, the defendant cannot be found liable for negligence regardless of how careless or unreasonable their conduct was.

In the tort of negligent misstatement, establishing a duty of care is necessary to determine whether the defendant should be held responsible for providing inaccurate information that caused the claimant economic loss. For example, in Hedley Byrne v Heller, the House of Lords found that a bank owed a duty of care to a company that relied on the bank's inaccurate credit report, resulting in financial loss. However, in another case a builder was found not to owe a duty of care to a purchaser who relied on a careless misrepresentation by the builder about the quality of a recently built house. Whether a duty exists depends on the relationship between the parties and if it was reasonably foreseeable that the statement would be relied upon to cause economic loss.

 Claims for pure economic loss also depend heavily on finding a duty of care. Liability for negligence generally only extends to loss that is physical injury or damage to property. Recovery for economic loss alone where there is no accompanying physical damage is more tenuous. The courts are cautious about imposing a duty of care for pure economic loss because of the potential for vast, indeterminate liability. They will consider the relationship between the parties, proximity, foreseeability, and public policy factors in determining whether a duty should exist. For example, in Murphy v Brentwood District Council, a duty of care was imposed on a local council for pure economic loss to homeowners after the council was negligent in inspecting and approving the foundations of a housing estate, which then began to subside. However, in another case a duty of care and liability for economic loss were not found when a ferry operator allowed a ferry to continue operating in unsafe conditions, but no actual accident or damage occurred.

In conclusion, establishing a duty of care is vital to determining liability in negligence. For claims of negligent misstatement and pure economic loss, finding a duty of care depends on a close relationship between the parties, reasonable foreseeability of harm, and public policy considerations. While a duty of care opens the door to liability, its limits help contain the scope of responsibility for negligent acts and protect defendants from unbounded claims. Overall, duty of care is a crucial mechanism for achieving fairness and balance in the tort of negligence.
