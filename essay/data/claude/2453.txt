Food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) are commonly used to assess the dietary intake and nutritional status of populations, including college students. However, there are some concerns about the accuracy of FFQs in determining actual nutritional intake. A survey of 86 first-year students at the University of Windsor in Canada in 2006 illustrates some of the potential shortcomings of FFQs and reveals some surprising results about students' nutritional intake.

FFQs rely on individuals self-reporting the types and frequencies of foods they have consumed over a given period of time, which introduces the possibility of both intentional and unintentional inaccuracies. People may underreport foods they perceive as unhealthy and overreport foods they believe are nutritious. They may also simply forget or be unaware of everything they have eaten. These self-reporting issues can result in skewed data on nutritional intake from FFQs.

The 2006 study of University of Windsor students used a 126-item FFQ to survey students about their food consumption in the previous month. The results suggested that females consumed more nutrients like iron and vitamin C, while males consumed more energy and fat - findings that aligned with general knowledge about the diets of young men and women. However, some surprising results were also found that contradict assumptions about the unhealthy diets of college students.

For example, the study found that the students consumed more than the recommended amounts of fruit, vegetables, grains, and dairy, while consuming fewer than the maximum recommended amounts of energy, fat, sugar, cholesterol, and sodium. Their mean body mass index was in the normal range. These results contradict the stereotype of college students as binge-drinking junk food consumers with poor diets and general health.  

The Windsor study illustrates how FFQs can yield unexpected insights into groups' nutritional intake and health that run counter to popular preconceptions. However, the reliability and accuracy of the results are limited by the self-reported nature of the data. Clarifying information may have helped decrease intentional or unintentional misreporting, and more objective measures of actual food consumption and biomarkers could have provided useful data for comparison. In the end, while FFQs have value as a low-cost way to gain insight into populations' diets, their findings should be viewed cautiously and corroborated with additional evidence whenever possible.
