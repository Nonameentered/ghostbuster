Here is a draft 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

CFS Insurance's current operations department is highly inefficient in managing policies and claims for customers across 20 states due to  poor organizational structure and siloed departments. To address these issues, a major restructuring  of the operations department has been proposed. The new structure will transition operations into technology-enabled and customer-focused teams that collaborate  cross-functionally. This structure will facilitate improved workflows, strategic thinking and data-driven decisions to better serve customers.   

Stakeholder management will be critical throughout the project to ensure buy-in and cooperation. Key stakeholders include operations employees, IT staff enabling new technologies, executives approving budgets, and customers impacted by changes. Stakeholders will be engaged early and often through regular communications like email updates, town halls, and one-on-one meetings. Their input and concerns will shape project plans to win their support. However, stakeholder resistance is a risk if communications are poor or changes are not clearly justified.  

The project will follow a traditional project management approach with detailed plans for cost, schedule and scope. The budget is $2.5 million over 6-8 months. A Work Breakdown Structure will decompose the project into tasks with estimates for durations and costs to calculate the critical path and reserve buffers. Earned value management will track progress by comparing actual and planned costs and schedules, allowing early correction of variances. Staff commitments will also be closely monitored to avoid overallocation. If executed well, this methodology will minimize financial, scheduling and resource risks.

Failure Mode and Effects Analysis will identify risks for each project task, the likelihood and impacts of each failure, and mitigation strategies. For example, a failure to redesign business processes could be mitigated by engaging subject matter experts. Risks will be proactively monitored and addressed to avoid impacts to project success. With a well-designed plan backed by rigorous analysis and oversight, the restructuring of operations at CFS Insurance can be completed on time and within budget to achieve the desired benefits. Overall, if the company can navigate the human and process challenges of such an initiative, the technology and customer service improvements should reward these efforts.
