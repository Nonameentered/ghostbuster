Here is a draft 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

A "strong" organisational culture, defined as a set of shared values, beliefs and norms that shape the identity of an organisation and guide employee behaviour, can have both benefits and downsides. On the one hand, a strong culture can promote employee alignment and loyalty, facilitate coordination, and support efficient group decision making. However, an overly strong culture can also discourage dissent and diversity of thought, leading to poor decision making and lack of innovation. The relative benefits and downsides ultimately depend on how well the culture aligns with the organisation's strategic priorities and encourages useful types of cohesion while still allowing for reasonable diversity of thought. 

A key benefit of a strong culture is that it helps align employees around shared goals and values. When members come together with a common sense of purpose and set of priorities, it is easier to work as a cohesive group. For example, the technology company W.L. Gore, known for products like Gore-Tex, has a strong culture emphasising autonomy, collaboration and experimentation. This culture has supported employee engagement and commitment to the company's innovative priorities.  

A strong culture also facilitates effective coordination between interdependent members or groups. At Southwest Airlines, a culture of teamwork and "fun" enables employees from pilots to baggage handlers to work together seamlessly in a fast-paced environment. This coordination allows Southwest to achieve quick turnarounds and the industry's best on-time performance record. Efficient coordination is highly dependent on shared expectations and trust, which a strong culture helps establish.

However, an overly strong culture has significant downsides in group decision making. It can discourage dissent, as members feel pressure to conform to the dominant views of the group. The culture at Enron, emphasising aggressive competition and discouraging dissent, is a notable example. This culture contributed to the poor strategic decisions and lack of ethical oversight that ultimately led to Enron's spectacular collapse in 2001.  

A strong culture may also limit diversity of thought, as it attracts and retains only those who fit in with the prevailing culture. However, diverse, dissimilar perspectives are essential for innovation and effective problem solving. Google's culture, for example, values diversity and encourages employees to question assumptions and avoid consensus thinking. This diversity of thought has proven essential for Google's innovation.  

In conclusion, while a strong culture has clear benefits in promoting alignment, coordination and efficient decision making, it needs to be balanced with openness to dissent and diversity. Strong cultures that support "shared values" and "coordination" while also accepting reasonable dissent and difference can leverage the upsides of culture, but avoid the potential downsides in group decision making. Overall, the specific nature and effects of a strong organisational culture depend on the types of cohesion and shared expectations it emphasises. The right balance is one that aligns with the organisation's most important priorities and values.
