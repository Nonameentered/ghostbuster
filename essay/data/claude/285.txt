The French labour movement has historically been divided along ideological lines between the CGT and CFDT, the two largest trade union confederations. The CGT, founded in 1895, adhered to a Marxist-inspired revolutionary syndicalism that advocated the overthrow of capitalism. The CFDT broke from the CGT in 1964 and adopted a reformist political stance, seeking to cooperate with employers to gradually improve workers’ conditions within the capitalist system. 

This ideological divide had major implications for trade union membership, collective bargaining, and the French system of neo-corporatist industrial relations. The CGT dominated membership for most of the 20th century, reaching nearly 5 million members in the post-World War 2 period. The revolutionary CGT was deeply antagonistic toward employers and the state, engaging in frequent strikes and protests. The reformist CFDT grew slowly but steadily, reaching 2 million members by the 1990s. The CFDT was more open to cooperative bargaining and partnership with employers and the government.

The ideological division hampered solidarity in the French labour movement and weakened unions’ leverage against employers and the state. However, some analysts argue that the CGT and CFDT have overcome their traditional ideological differences in recent decades. They point to cooperation between the unions on certain issues, like opposition to pension reform in 1995 and 2010. The CGT has also moderated some of its revolutionary rhetoric and become more open to negotiation.

However, the CGT and CFDT remain fundamentally divided in their strategies and orientations. The CGT continues to define itself as a revolutionary union aiming to overthrow capitalism, while the CFDT maintains its reformist stance. They differ on key issues like working time regulation and responses to economic liberalization. The CGT is more willing to engage in conflictual tactics like strikes, while the CFDT prioritizes negotiation. Membership in the unions still corresponds to distinct leftist and centrist political preferences.

Beyond the CGT-CFDT divide, the French trade union movement faces internal divisions on occupational, political and regional lines. The FO union and independent "autonomous" unions compete for membership. Regional unions in areas like Corsica or the French Caribbean pursue distinct agendas. While inter-union cooperation occurs at times, the highly fragmented nature of the French labour movement contributes to its overall weakness relative to employers and the state.

In conclusion, while the CGT and CFDT have found some common ground on select issues, ideological divisions between them persist and continue to fracture the French trade union movement. Overcoming these deep-rooted differences poses a major challenge to building union solidarity and strength in France.
