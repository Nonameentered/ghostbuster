Here is a draft 2250-word essay in response to the prompt:

The Renold company experienced a difficult year ending December 31, 2020, with several factors contributing to poor financial performance and declining profitability. Revenue declined by 12% from the previous year to $328 million, driven by a slowdown in key end markets like automotive, general industrial, and aerospace due to the COVID-19 pandemic and recession. Gross profit margin declined from 32% to 28% due to higher costs for raw materials, transportation, and labor. Net income declined by 49% to just $15 million. 

An analysis of key ratios shows the major impacts on profitability and efficiency. The gross profit margin ratio declined from 32% to 28%, showing the company's inability to pass on higher costs to customers. The net profit margin ratio declined from 9.4% to 4.6%, indicating the squeeze on profits due to lower revenue and higher costs. The return on assets ratio declined from 9.2% to 4.8%, showing lower efficiency in generating profits from assets. The inventory turnover ratio declined from 6.4 times to 5.2 times, indicating less efficient management of inventory.

To combat these cost pressures, Renold has taken several actions. The company is accelerating suppliers' price increase pass-throughs to customers to recover margins. The company is also making changes to its supply chain and renegotiating contracts with logistics providers to reduce costs. Renold is restructuring various aspects of its business to improve efficiencies. For example, it has reduced headcount by 10% and cut other marketing, travel and entertainment expenses by 15-20%. These measures should help improve key ratios around costs and efficiency going forward.

Based on this analysis, I would recommend holding Renold shares for long-term oriented investors willing to withstand short-term difficulties. Revenue and profits should improve in 2021 along with the overall economy. Cost-cutting initiatives and price increases should help gross and net profit margins recover next year. Renold stands to benefit from long-term trends like automation and digitization across its end markets. However, the stock could face volatility in the near-term. For investors seeking strong stability and cash flows in the next year, the risks may currently outweigh the rewards. 

Adopting new accounting standards like IFRS or the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 may impact how Renold accounts for costs, deferred revenue, and key contracts. Transitioning to new standards often requires adjustments to past financial statements to provide comparable reporting. The new standards may introduce some volatility in reported revenue, gross margins and net income as the accounting changes are implemented over the next year. However, these impacts are often temporary, and the new standards aim to provide more transparency into the company's performance over the long run.

In summary, Renold faced a difficult year in 2020 due to macroeconomic headwinds and cost pressures but is taking prudent steps to navigate a recovery. The financial impacts of new accounting standards should be monitored but are unlikely to change the long-term outlook. While next year may still hold volatility, Renold appears positioned for improved performance over the coming years as the economy rebounds and its own initiatives take hold. With a recovery on the horizon, long-term investors should consider maintaining a position in Renold to benefit from its upside.
