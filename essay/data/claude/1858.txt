How to Effectively Market a Crime/Thriller Novel and New Author on a Budget

Marketing a crime/thriller novel to a distinct audience and establishing a new author on a budget requires targeted messaging and creative use of low-cost strategies. For a crime novel, focus your efforts on reaching voracious readers of the genre who consume books quickly and rely on word-of-mouth and personal recommendations for finding new books and authors. These core readers can help propel a new novel and author to success through reviews and social media if you can effectively capture their attention and motivate them to spread the word. 

A compelling pitch focused on elements of the story that align well with reader expectations for a good crime/thriller is key. This includes highlighting a relatable yet complex protagonist working to solve a mystery or crime, suspenseful pacing with red herrings and plot twists, menacing villains, and a sense of gritty realism. Blog posts, social media posts, and a strong book blurb can all convey these aspects to capture reader interest. Next, seek out and engage crime fiction book reviewers and bloggers, offering free review copies to help generate critical reviews. Even if only a small percentage of requests are accepted and lead to coverage, the resulting reviews and word-of-mouth will expose the book to many potential readers.

Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Goodreads provide low-cost ways to connect directly with readers and build excitement. Regular posts about the story, characters, settings, and themes can engage readers, as well as topical posts about news stories related to crime and mystery. Run a series of contests and giveaways, offering free ebook or print copies of the novel in exchange for reviews and social media posts. This incentivizes readers to engage with the book and spread awareness to their networks. 

Look for free or low-cost ways to connect with readers in person at libraries, book clubs, and local bookstores. Ask to speak on author panels or offer to teach a workshop on the genre. Setting up a booth at a street fair or festival is an easy way to engage with and sell books to readers. Building this local, grassroots support will expand word-of-mouth and make the book more visible to distributors and booksellers.  

While no marketing strategy can guarantee a successful crime novel and new author, focusing resources on directly engaging voracious readers of the genre through social media, in-person events, and free review copies is an effective approach, especially when employed creatively on a tight budget. With time and consistency, these strategies can gain enough local momentum to spread more widely through reviews, word-of-mouth, and distribution in libraries and storesâ€”leading to a breakout book and new author. The key is understanding your core readers and crafting strategic messages and interactions tailored specifically for them.
