Dark matter refers to material in the universe that does not emit or reflect light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. Scientists have inferred its existence through its gravitational effect on visible matter in the universe. Cold dark matter is the leading theoretical form of dark matter, consisting of slowly moving elementary particles that have weak interactions with normal matter. Cold dark matter is vital to understanding how structure formed in the universe. 

The existence of dark matter was first proposed based on observations of galaxy rotation curves. The rotational speed of objects in a galaxy depends on the distribution of mass within the galaxy. Based on the distribution of visible matter, the rotation curves of spiral galaxies should drop off with increasing distance from the galactic center. However, observations show that rotation curves remain flat, indicating the presence of additional unseen mass extending beyond the visible matter. This observations suggests that there is far more mass in galaxies than can be accounted for by visible matter aloneâ€”the missing mass is what we call dark matter.

Cold dark matter provides the simplest explanation for dark matter that fits with observations. According to the cold dark matter theory, dark matter consists of stable elementary particles that move slowly compared to the speed of light. These cold dark matter particles interact through gravitational and weak nuclear forces but have very little interaction with normal matter. Examples of hypothesized particles include axions, sterile neutrinos, and weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs). Because they move slowly and rarely interact, cold dark matter particles clump together through gravitational attraction into large halos surrounding galaxies and clusters. These massive halos provide the extra mass observed in galaxy rotation curves and are vital to the formation of large-scale structure in the universe.

Cold dark matter plays a crucial role in cosmological structure formation. According to the leading theory of cold dark matter cosmology, tiny density fluctuations in the early universe were amplified by gravity into the large-scale structure we observe today. Cold dark matter particles clumped around these initial density fluctuations, and their gravitational influence caused normal matter to follow suit. Over time, the accumulation of cold dark matter into halos enabled the formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Computer simulations based on the cold dark matter model remarkably reproduce the complex web-like structure and clustering of galaxies observed in our universe. The ability of cold dark matter theory to account for many features of observed galaxy clustering lends it significant support. 

In summary, cold dark matter is the leading theory that provides a compelling explanation for dark matter and its role in shaping the structure of the universe. Observations of galaxy rotation curves point to the existence of dark matter, and cold dark matter consisting of weakly interacting particles that form massive halos provides a simple model consistent with these observations. Cold dark matter theory also enables structure formation in the universe and the development of galaxies and clusters. With mounting supporting evidence from observations and simulations, cold dark matter stands as our best model for understanding the missing mass in the universe and its profound influence on cosmological evolution.
