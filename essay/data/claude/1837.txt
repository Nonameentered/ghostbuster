Both sensory evaluation and chemical analysis can be used to assess the freshness and quality of fish samples. Sensory evaluation involves trained panelists using their senses of sight, smell, and touch to evaluate characteristics such as appearance, odor, and texture that can indicate how fresh the fish is. Chemical analysis involves measuring compounds such as total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), trimethylamine (TMA), and biogenic amines that are formed or break down as fish spoils over time. 

While sensory evaluation can provide a holistic impression of fish quality, it is subjective and can vary based on the individual panelists and their level of experience. Panelists must be extensively trained to evaluate fish in a consistent manner. Properly trained panelists can detect subtle changes that occur as fish spoils that chemical tests may miss. However, it may be difficult for even experienced panelists to reliably discriminate between fish samples that differ only slightly in freshness. In contrast, chemical tests are objective and quantitative, providing a standardized measure of compounds indicative of spoilage that can detect even small changes. However, chemical tests only measure a limited number of specific compounds, rather than providing an overall assessment of quality. They may not always accurately reflect the changes detected by sensory evaluation.

The results of sensory and chemical evaluation of the two trout samples in this case highlight some of these limitations. The sensory panel detected only minor differences between the two samples, rating them as “reasonably” and “fairly” fresh with slightly duller eyes and increased slime in the “fairly” fresh sample. These results suggest the fish were still quite fresh, but one sample was marginally less so. In contrast, chemical testing showed a doubling of TVB-N and TMA levels and a 50% increase in putrescine, indicating substantially reduced freshness in one sample. The chemical tests suggested a difference in quality that the human panelists mostly missed. However, the chemical tests may be overestimating the actual difference in eating quality and consumer acceptability. 

In conclusion, while both sensory evaluation and chemical analysis have value in assessing fish freshness, each has certain limitations. An approach that combines both sensory and chemical testing may provide the most comprehensive and accurate indication of fish quality. Sensory panels remain vital to evaluating subtle changes in quality that can impact eating experience. But chemical tests can provide objective measures of spoilage indicators, allowing more definitive comparisons of samples that may seem only marginally different to human panelists. By using both techniques together, fish freshness and quality can be thoroughly and reliably evaluated.
