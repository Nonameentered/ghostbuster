The family of a 6-week-old infant brought to A+E for bruising from an accident at home will likely face significant psychological stressors and social deprivations that could negatively impact the well-being of the child. 

First, the parents are likely to experience anxiety, guilt, and self-blame over the accident and injury to their baby. As new parents, they may doubt their ability to properly care for an infant, leading to feelings of inadequacy. They will likely require reassurance from physicians and nurses that the bruising, while serious, will heal and that they did the right thing by bringing the infant for care right away.

Second, the infant may experience disruptions to feeding, sleeping, and bonding due to medical evaluations and care required to assess the extent of injuries. At only 6 weeks of age, the baby is dependent on the parents to meet basic needs, so any separation from parents could be distressing. The medical staff should aim to keep the baby with the parents as much as possible to avoid further stress. 

Finally, the family may face social isolation or judgment from others who learn about the accident and injury. Close family and friends should offer support and help the new parents avoid blaming themselves. If police or social services become involved to investigate possible abuse, this could further strain family relationships and functioning.

Evidence-based interventions to address these stressors include reassurance and education from medical staff, keeping the infant close to parents as much as possible, counseling or therapy referrals for anxiety or guilt, parenting education and support groups to build confidence, and close monitoring by health visitors to ensure the well-being and safety of the baby and provide additional support to the family. With compassionate care and support, this family can overcome this stressful experience.
