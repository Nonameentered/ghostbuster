Supramolecular hydrogels are polymer networks formed through non-covalent interactions between monomers rather than covalent bonds. These physical crosslinks, such as hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic interactions, enable supramolecular hydrogels to have dynamic and reversible structures that can respond to environmental changes. This distinctive property makes supramolecular hydrogels promising candidates for controlled drug delivery. By tailoring the non-covalent interactions between monomers, supramolecular hydrogels can be designed to change their structures and release profiles in response to physiological cues. 

Recent advancements in supramolecular hydrogels have provided a better understanding of how to manipulate non-covalent interactions to achieve the desired responsiveness and drug release kinetics. For example, the strength and reversibility of hydrogen bonds can be tuned by changing the number of hydrogen bonds, type of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors, and introducing competitive molecules. Adding hydrophobic monomers or changing the degree of hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity balance can strengthen or weaken hydrophobic interactions. Ionic interactions can also be introduced and tailored to make supramolecular hydrogels sensitive to ionic strength and pH.

By strategically incorporating these non-covalent interactions, supramolecular hydrogels with complex responsiveness can be constructed. One such example is a supramolecular hydrogel formed from hyaluronic acid and α-cyclodextrin that is sensitive to both pH and reactive oxygen species. The hydrogel swells and releases drugs in response to low pH and high reactive oxygen species, providing targeted delivery under inflammatory conditions. Another study developed a supramolecular hydrogel from polyethylene glycol and β-cyclodextrin that releases insulin in response to glucose. The hydrogel works by competitive binding, where increasing glucose concentrations displace insulin from the hydrogel network.

In conclusion, supramolecular hydrogels have expanded our understanding of how to rationally design dynamic polymer networks through non-covalent interactions between monomers. By gaining control over these interactions, supramolecular hydrogels can be engineered to have complex responsiveness to multiple physiological stimuli, paving the way for smart drug delivery systems that can achieve precision treatment. Recent advancements in tailoring hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and ionic interactions have been instrumental to progress in this field. Overall, supramolecular hydrogels are a promising platform for next-generation drug delivery.
