The chloride content of milk is determined through a titration analysis using a silver nitrate solution. Silver nitrate reacts with chloride ions to form a precipitate of silver chloride. By adding silver nitrate solution to a milk sample and measuring how much is required to reach the equivalence point when all the chloride has precipitated, the total chloride concentration can be calculated.

Normal cow's milk contains on average 0.12% chloride. Milk from cows with mastitis, an inflammation of the mammary gland, often has a higher chloride content. This is because mastitis results in damage to the milk secretory tissue in the udder, allowing plasma constituents like chloride and sodium to leak into the milk. As the permeability of the tissue increases, the chloride concentration rises. Chloride levels of 0.2% or higher are frequently observed in mastitic milk. 

In addition to the increase in chloride, mastitic milk also shows a decrease in lactose, the main sugar found in milk. Lactose is synthesized by mammary gland cells, so when these cells are damaged during mastitis, less lactose is produced and secreted into the milk. Lactose levels below 4.5% are often indicative of mastitis.

By determining the chloride content through titration and measuring the lactose level, it is possible to identify if a cow may have mastitis. The principles behind these analyses are that the healthy mammary gland tightly regulates what compounds get into the milk, while a damaged or inflamed gland loses some of this selectivity, allowing plasma components in and reducing normal milk constituents. These changes can serve as useful diagnostic markers for mastitis screening and milk quality testing.

In summary, chloride content is measured through a titration with silver nitrate, allowing the total chloride in a milk sample to be calculated. While normal milk has a consistent chloride level around 0.12% , mastitic milk tends to be higher in chloride, often 0.2% or above. At the same time, mastitic milk is typically lower in lactose due to impaired production. By determining chloride and lactose levels, it is possible to identify changes indicative of mastitis for the purposes of quality control and mastitis detection.
