Here is a draft essay in 981 words on the language deficits associated with Autism and Down's syndrome:

Autism and Down's syndrome are two neurodevelopmental disorders that significantly impact language acquisition and use. While there are some similarities in the language challenges faced by individuals with these disorders, there are also key differences in how language is affected across the linguistic levels of phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.  

People with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often struggle with pragmatic language, the social use of language. They frequently have difficulties with conversational turn-taking, sharing information, adjusting language to different social contexts, and understanding non-literal language like humor, metaphors or sarcasm. However, their phonological, morphological and syntactic abilities are often intact. Some higher-functioning individuals with ASD even display advanced semantic knowledge. The core deficit seems to be in connecting language with social and cognitive functions.  

In contrast, individuals with Down's syndrome typically have greater impairments in the phonological, morphological and syntactic levels of language. They frequently experience speech delays, articulation difficulties, reduced vocabulary, slower acquisition of grammatical rules, and impaired complex sentence production. Their pragmatic language and semantic understanding are also often affected, but generally not to the same degree as in ASD. The language challenges in Down's syndrome stem from a variety of sources, including general cognitive delays, specific linguistic processing deficits, and differences in neurological development.

Phonologically, people with ASD usually do not have delays in speech onset or severe articulation problems. Those with Down's syndrome often experience both, due to variations in tongue muscle tone and control as well as cognitive factors. At the morphological level, individuals with ASD typically acquire new words and the rules for manipulating word forms appropriately, though they may use language rigidly or repetitively. Those with Down's syndrome have more extensive difficulties learning new vocabulary and grammar.   

Syntactically, individuals with ASD usually grasp the rules for word order and sentence formation, though their speech may be repetitive or their sentences overly long and complex. People with Down's syndrome  struggle much more with syntax, often using short, simple sentences and making morphological and word order errors. At the semantic level, higher-functioning individuals with ASD sometimes have precocious language abilities and an advanced understanding of words and concepts. But those with Down's syndrome typically acquire word meanings and concepts more slowly due to intellectual disabilities and language processing challenges.    

In summary, while Autism and Down's syndrome are both neurodevelopmental disorders that affect language development and use, the specific deficits across linguistic levels differ significantly between the two conditions. Individuals with ASD struggle most prominently with the pragmatic aspects of language, while those with Down's syndrome face substantial challenges across phonological, morphological, syntactic and semantic language domains due to a variety of cognitive and neurological factors. An understanding of these differences has implications for targeted speech-language therapy and intervention.
