The analysis of animal bone assemblages from archaeological sites can provide a wealth of information about human diet, animal husbandry practices, environment, and climate in the past. The faunal remains from a recently excavated British site were analyzed using several methods to categorize the bones and assess the species present, ages of animals, evidence of weathering and butchery, and the minimum number of individuals represented. 

The first step in analyzing the assemblage was to sort the bones by taxon, element, and size. Taxon refers to the animal type, such as cattle, sheep/goat, pig, etc. The element refers to the specific bone, such as femur, humerus, or vertebra. And the size category provides information about the age range of the animal, such as adult, subadult or juvenile. Each bone was examined to determine the taxon and element, and measured to determine size and age range. These data were recorded in a database.

A comparative collection of modern skeletal specimens was used to aid in identification. Certain key morphological features, such as shape, density, and articulating surfaces of each bone were compared between the archaeological specimens and the reference skeletons. This allowed even fragmented bones to be identified to a taxonomic category. Unidentifiable bone fragments were weighed and recorded as “unidentified medium mammal” or similar category.

Evidence of weathering and butchery on the bones was also noted, such as knife marks from skinning and dismembering, signs of burning, gnawing from scavengers, and cracks from sun exposure. Butchery marks indicate the animal was used as a food source. Weathering and gnawing point to the bones being exposed to the elements for some time before burial. The types of marks present can reveal information about butchery and cooking practices.

To determine the minimum number of individuals (MNI) represented for each species, the bones were sorted by side (left or right), element (e.g. humerus), and age/size category. The MNI is the smallest number of individuals necessary to account for all bone specimens of a certain taxon. For example, three right humeri and two left humeri of adult cattle would indicate an MNI of two for adult cattle. The MNI provides a conservative estimate of the actual number of animals present.

The number of individual specimens (NISP) is simply the total count of all bone fragments identified as a particular taxon. While useful as a broad measure of relative abundance, the NISP can be skewed by differential preservation and fragmentation of certain elements. Therefore, MNI is typically regarded as a more reliable measure for inter-site comparisons.

At the British site, the analysis revealed cattle as the dominant species in the assemblage, with an MNI of 12 and NISP of 235. Sheep/goat were also well represented, with an MNI of 11 and NISP of 183. The high prevalence of cattle and sheep/goat bones indicates that husbandry of these animals was an important part of the local economy. Pigs were less common, with an MNI of 3 and NISP of 22, suggesting they were of secondary importance. Horse remains were scarce (MNI = 1, NISP = 8), indicating they were not commonly eaten.

In comparison, a nearby site in the same time period showed a slightly higher reliance on sheep/goat (MNI = 17) versus cattle (MNI = 14), and more evidence of pig husbandry (MNI = 8). While the sites showed some differences in species emphasis, taken together they paint a picture of an agricultural community engaged predominantly in cattle and sheep/goat farming for food, raw materials, and trade.

In summary, the analysis of animal bones from archaeological sites provides significant data about human-animal relationships and how people lived and sustained themselves in the past. By identifying species type, age, evidence of butchery, and calculating MNI and NISP, a great deal can be learned about the relative importance of certain animals to the local economy and environment at the time. Comparing the results across sites helps establish a broader understanding of human settlement, subsistence, and landscape use during a given time period.
