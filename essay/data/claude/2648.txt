Investigating how the boiling point of cyclohexane varies with pressure provides insights into how intermolecular forces affect the phase transitions of materials. Cyclohexane is a hydrocarbon with a simple molecular structure, consisting of six carbon atoms arranged in a ring. At standard pressure, cyclohexane boils at 81°C. As pressure increases, the boiling point also increases due to the effect of pressure on intermolecular interactions.

To investigate the pressure dependence of cyclohexane's boiling point, the experiment is conducted using a pressurized reaction vessel. Cyclohexane is added to the vessel, which is then sealed. A pressure gauge and temperature probe inside the vessel are used to monitor the pressure and temperature. The vessel sits in a temperature-controlled bath, which is initially set below the standard boiling point of cyclohexane. 

As the temperature of the bath is slowly increased, the temperature inside the vessel also rises. When the internal temperature reaches 81°C at standard pressure, bubbles of cyclohexane vapor form as the liquid boils. However, because the vessel is sealed, the vapor pressure builds up, increasing the overall pressure inside the vessel. This increased pressure forces the cyclohexane molecules closer together, enabling stronger intermolecular interactions that require higher temperatures to overcome. The boiling point therefore increases.

By gradually increasing the temperature of the bath in small increments, the precise temperature at which boiling occurs at each pressure level can be determined. A graph of the pressure inside the vessel versus the boiling temperature reveals a linear relationship. The slope of this graph quantifies how sensitive the boiling point is to changes in pressure. Materials with stronger intermolecular forces will exhibit a greater dependence of boiling point on pressure.

This experiment thus provides data to both demonstrate the effect of pressure on phase changes as well as gain insights into the strengths of intermolecular forces of specific compounds. The results for cyclohexane can then be compared to similar experiments with other hydrocarbons and related materials. In summary, the purpose of this investigation is to explore fundamental concepts of phase transitions, intermolecular forces, and molecular interactions.
