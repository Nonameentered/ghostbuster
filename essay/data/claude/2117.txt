The acquisition of language in children is a complex biological and social process that develops naturally in humans in the first years of life. Language acquisition involves learning spoken language, whereas reading and writing acquisition involves learning to associate speech sounds or signs  with written representations, and learning the skills and conventions of reading and writing. While language acquisition seems to be innate to humans, reading and writing are cultural inventions that must be taught. 

Researchers have determined that very young children have an innate ability to learn language simply through exposure. Infants start learning language in the womb, where they begin to recognize the sounds and speech patterns of the language they are exposed to. After birth, infants continue learning through listening to the speech around them. With little explicit instruction, toddlers develop a vocabulary of hundreds of words between 18 months and 3 years old and begin combining words into simple sentences. The process of learning language is natural, universal, and develops in a predictable sequence across cultures.

In contrast, reading and writing ability does not develop naturally and must be explicitly taught. Children must learn that written symbols represent speech sounds and words. They must learn spelling, grammar, and comprehension skills to become literate. While oral language learning is mostly complete by age 3, literacy takes many years of education and practice to develop. Learning to read and write varies greatly across and within cultures based on the writing systems and educational opportunities available. 

Researchers have investigated whether chimpanzees and other great apes have an innate capacity for language learning comparable to young children. Some researchers have attempted to teach chimpanzees to communicate using gestures, symbols, and speech. The most well-known research in this area was Project Nim, which aimed to teach a chimp named Nim Chimpsky to communicate using sign language. However, there is little evidence chimps can master grammar and syntax in these studies.captive chimps can only learn to associate specific symbols or signs with particular objects and actions, not acquire generative language spontaneously. Their learning appears limited since it requires intensive training and the chimpanzees do not seem motivated to communicate with humans for its own sake.

While human children have a strong innate predisposition for language, chimpanzees and other animals do not appear to have the biological capacity for natural language acquisition seen in humans. The differences between human language acquisition and chimpanzee communication highlight the uniqueness of the human ability to develop complex language systems. Overall, this essay outlines some key differences in how children naturally acquire spoken language but have to be taught how to read and write, while chimpanzees struggle to even learn basic symbolic communication without extensive training and instruction. The acquisition of language seems to set humans apart.
