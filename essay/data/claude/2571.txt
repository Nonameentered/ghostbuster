Analysis of the Multimodality of a Dr Pepper Television Advert

Television adverts are highly multimodal texts that employ a variety of modes, including visual imagery, audio, language, and more to persuade audiences and sell products. A 2016 television advert for Dr Pepper, the soft drink brand, uses a combination of modes to construct a fun, quirky, and youthful brand image and promote the product. 

The most immediately striking mode in the advert is the visual. The advert is set in what appears to be a stylish apartment building, with attractive young people as the main characters. The bright colors, exciting activities like dancing and socializing, and fast-paced editing with many quick cuts give an energetic feel to the visuals. Close-up shots of the characters having fun while drinking Dr Pepper, with smiles and laughter, associate the positive feelings and experiences with the product. The young, fashionable characters and activities depicted cater to a youth target audience, signaling that drinking Dr Pepper can make you feel alive and socially connected.

The audio mode, especially the upbeat pop soundtrack that plays throughout the advert, works together with the visuals to create energy and excitement. The volume of the music rises and falls with the transitions between shots, emphasizing the rapid pace and liveliness of the visuals. The song's lyrics, "It's the little things, it's the little moments, it's knowing we'll be alright," reflect the positivity and relationships shown on screen. The combination of upbeat tempo and optimistic lyrics transfers these feelings to the audience's experience of the brand.

Language is used minimally but strategically in the advert. The only language is the Dr Pepper logo and product shots, as well as the slogan which appears at the end: "Dr Pepper. One of One." The effect is a minimalist but memorable tagline that suggests Dr Pepper is unique and one-of-a-kind. The absence of any verbal language otherwise places more emphasis on the visuals and music to convey the brand image. The modes work together in a highly cohesive manner with a consistent energetic and youthful tone.

In conclusion, the Dr Pepper television advert employs a variety of multimodal elements, especially visuals, audio, and language, to construct an exciting brand image targeting youth audiences. The upbeat music and visuals give an energetic tone, while the minimal use of language contributes to a memorable tagline. The advert is a highly effective example of multimodality where the different modes intertwine to persuade audiences and promote the product.
