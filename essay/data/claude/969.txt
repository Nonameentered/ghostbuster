Here is a draft 1749 word essay in response to the prompt:

The U.S. president is granted a relatively limited set of powers under the Constitution. The executive branch that the president heads was envisioned by the founders as weaker than the judiciary and especially the legislature. However, presidents have gained significant influence and authority over time through the accumulation and exercise of informal powers and exploiting opportune circumstances. While the president's formal powers remain limited on paper, in practice modern presidents wield a level of authority and influence that extends well beyond what the Constitution outlines.

The Constitution provides the president with a modest set of enumerated powers, focused primarily on commanding the military, appointing executive officers and ambassadors, and handling foreign relations. Domestically, the president has no explicit power to legislate, as that authority is reserved for Congress. The president's formal powers are also checked and balanced by the other branches of government. For example, treaties and appointments require Senate approval, legislation can be vetoed, and the Supreme Court can declare executive actions unconstitutional. In this structurally weak position, presidents have little chance of success without building up their authority through informal means.

One of the most significant informal powers presidents have at their disposal is the bully pulpit. Through public persuasion and speeches, presidents can place issues on the national agenda, shape public opinion, and pressure other political actors. When presidents appeal directly to voters, it is difficult for members of Congress, especially in the president's own party, to directly oppose them. Franklin Roosevelt mastered the use of radio broadcasts and Franklin D. Roosevelt used the bully pulpit to promote his New Deal programs. More recently, presidents have utilized media appearances on television and social media to reach citizens directly and expand their influence.

Presidents also gain power based on circumstances and events. In times of crisis, such as wars or economic downturns, presidents are granted more authority and latitude to act. The president is the commander-in-chief, so during wartime presidents take on more power to direct military strategy and spending. They also gain support for actions that would likely fail under normal circumstances. For example, Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus during the Civil War, and Franklin Roosevelt greatly expanded the size and role of the federal government in response to the Great Depression. Moments of crisis provide presidents the opportunity to shape events and enact change.  

Strong leadership and charisma also afford presidents more authority to persuade and achieve their goals. Force of character and personality have allowed some presidents to expand influence. Through ambitious agendas and mastery of policy details, presidents like Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan shaped debate and legislation through sheer will and determination. Their talents for understanding politics and twisting arms allowed them to make progress on priorities like civil rights reform and tax cuts. Although the powers of the office remain limited, the influence and authority of individual presidents depends significantly on their leadership abilities and personal qualities.

In conclusion, while the Constitution provides the president with a restricted set of powers and responsibilities, modern presidents have established much more expansive influence. They have built up their authority through informal means, exercising and expanding the bully pulpit, gaining more latitude during crises, and leveraging their leadership and persuasiveness. The power of the president depends more on how individuals in the role choose to pursue and achieve their goals, as much as on the structural powers granted to the office. The presidency has evolved to become as powerful as the people who occupy the White House and their skill in gaining the trust and support of citizens and government officials.
