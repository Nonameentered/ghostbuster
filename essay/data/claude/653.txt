Within International Relations (IR) theory, there is an ongoing debate between moral pluralists and universalists over the nature and content of ethical norms. Moral pluralists argue that moral values are socially constructed within particular societies and cultures. There are no universal or absolute moral standards that apply across all contexts. Moral universalists, on the other hand, believe that some fundamental moral values and norms—such as prohibitions against murder, slavery, and torture—should apply universally to all societies and cultures. 

Three perspectives within IR theory that contribute to this debate are communitarianism, realism, and cosmopolitanism. Communitarians are moral pluralists who believe ethical values are defined within particular communities. There are no universal moral rules and norms outside of a community's own values. Realists also adopt a pluralist view, arguing that moral concerns are secondary to states' pursuit of power and self-interest in an anarchic international system. Cosmopolitans, on the other hand, are moral universalists. They believe there are certain fundamental moral rules regarding individual dignity and human rights that should govern state behavior and apply universally across all societies.

Communitarianism is a pluralist perspective that sees moral values as defined within and specific to particular communities. Communitarians argue that moral reasoning is shaped by communal traditions and practices. There are no universal or absolute moral principles outside of a community's own conceptions of moral right and wrong. Morality is thus relative to the values of each community. As Walzer argues, "There are no transcendent moral principles, no external moral realm, no moral rules or truths that hold regardless of location or culture.”

In contrast, moral universalism holds that some moral values and norms should apply universally to all human beings regardless of cultural differences. Cosmopolitans adopt a universalist stance, arguing for the existence of certain fundamental moral rules regarding human dignity and rights that should govern state behavior across all societies. These include prohibitions against genocide, torture, and slavery, as well as rights to life, political participation, and basic subsistence. As Beitz argues, “There are certain elementary protections...that should be accessible to all persons, regardless of their communal attachments or aspirations.” 

Between these competing pluralist and universalist views sit realists, who are pluralists primarily concerned with states' pursuit of power and self-interest. Realists argue that moral concerns are secondary in an anarchic international system where states must ensure their security and survival. Moral values and human rights matter only within states, not in the relations between them. There are no universal moral rules constraining state behavior externally. As Morgenthau argues, “Universal moral principles cannot be applied to the actions of states."

In conclusion, there are compelling arguments on both sides of the pluralism-universalism debate. Communitarian and realist perspectives provide pluralist conceptions of morality as defined within local communities or secondary to states' self-interest. Cosmopolitanism offers a universalist view of certain moral rules regarding human dignity that should apply everywhere. Resolving this debate has important implications for human rights, international law, and global governance. Overall, pluralism and universalism represent fundamentally different visions of ethics in global politics.
