The concept of Logos or 'Reason' is central to the philosophy of the pre-Socratic thinker Heraclitus. For Heraclitus, the Logos represents the underlying rational principle of the universe that orders and governs all things. However, Heraclitus conceives of this rational principle in a way that is paradoxical and enigmatic. On the one hand, the Logos is a cosmic law of divine reason. On the other hand, it represents the process of constant change and flux that dominates the nature of reality. 

Heraclitus views the cosmos as a dynamic process ordered by Logos, a force that determines how all things change and transform. He argues that the Logos is the supreme governing principle of the universe, the source of all meaning, order and stability in the world. At the same time, Heraclitus observes that the nature of reality and existence is in constant flux and change. “All things flow and nothing abides; everything gives way and nothing stays fixed” (Fragment 91). This philosophy of universal flux leads Heraclitus to the conclusion that all sense perceptions are illusory and deceptive. True understanding can only come through recognizing the Logos, the underlying rational principle that structures and synthesizes all changing phenomena.

Heraclitus articulates his vision of the Logos through the use of paradoxes and enigmatic statements. For example, in Fragment 32 he writes: “The wise is one only. It is unwilling and willing to be called by the name of Zeus.” The Logos represents a unified whole at the same time as it manifests itself in opposite principles. The paradoxes point beyond common ways of thinking to a deeper truth about the unity and harmony between opposites. The Logos expresses itself as the tension and concord between opposites - as in Fragment 45: “Opposition brings concord. Out of discord comes the fairest harmony.” The opposites are united in a harmonious system by the power of the Logos.

The Logos also represents the divine law and wisdom that governs the eternal flux and change of all things. For Heraclitus, the constant play of opposites that produces change also expresses the immortal and unchanging Logos. As he writes in Fragment 84: “For the twenty-five letters are immortal though they compose transient words.” Although words and all phenomena are in flux, the letters (representing the Logos) remain eternal and unchanging. The Logos is paradoxically both the unchanging wisdom that orders the universe as well as the process of continual flux and change itself.

In conclusion, the concept of Logos or Reason is key to understanding Heraclitus’ philosophy. The Logos represents the rational, divine principle that governs the cosmos and gives order to the constant flux and chaos of existence. However, Heraclitus conceives of the Logos in a profoundly paradoxical fashion. It is both the eternal, unchanging law of the universe as well as the process of continual change itself. The Logos mysteriously unites opposites and brings harmony out of discord. By articulating his vision of Logos through paradoxes, Heraclitus points beyond logical reasoning to a deeper intuition of the unity between opposites and the harmony that underlies all change and diversity. The paradox of Heraclitus’ Logos reflects his insight into the fundamentally ambiguous and enigmatic nature of existence.
