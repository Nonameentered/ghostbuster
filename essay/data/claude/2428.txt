The digital filtering solution proposed in the report aims to improve the speech compression system developed by the company. The current system compresses digital speech signals to enable efficient transmission and storage of audio data. However, the compression process introduces some distortion and noise in the signal. The proposed digital filtering solution addresses this issue by removing the unwanted frequency components from the compressed speech signal to enhance its quality and intelligibility.

Specifically, the report suggests implementing a low-pass filter to attenuate the high-frequency components above a cutoff frequency of 4 kHz. Since most of the speech energy and information is concentrated below 4 kHz, attenuating the higher frequencies will not degrade the speech signal significantly. However, it will help remove the hissing sounds and other noise introduced by the compression algorithms. By filtering out these unwanted high-frequency components, the proposed solution can improve the overall perceptual quality of the compressed speech and make it more pleasant and natural sounding to the human ear.

The benefits of this digital filtering solution for the company's speech compression system are two-fold. First, it can enhance the quality and intelligibility of the compressed speech signals to provide a better customer experience. Clear and natural-sounding speech is essential for many applications like telecommunications, voice assistants, and audio books. Second, by improving the perceptual quality of the compressed audio, the proposed filter can help make the company's speech compression technology more competitive and attractive to potential customers and partners. In summary, the digital filtering solution can add value to the speech compression system through substantial improvements in audio quality, user experience, and commercial viability. Overall, this solution is poised to strengthen the company's position as an innovator in speech processing technologies.
