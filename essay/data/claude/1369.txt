Using an electronic online corpus as an analytic tool to analyze the semantic prosody of a phrase provides several findings. First, the genre of texts selected for analysis greatly impacts the results. The semantic prosody refers to the contextual associations of a phrase and whether they are generally positive or negative. A phrase may convey a positive semantic prosody in casual conversations, news articles or academic texts but a negative semantic prosody in political speeches or opinion pieces. For example, an analysis of the phrase "immigration reform" shows it has a positive semantic prosody in most genres as it is associated with positive concepts like "progress," " necessary," and "overdue." However, in political speeches by anti-immigration politicians, it has a negative semantic prosody and is associated more with "amnesty," "chaos" and "crisis." 

Second, semantic prosodies can shift over time based on current events and wider public opinions. A phrase that once conveyed a negative semantic prosody can become more neutral or even positive. For instance, "artificial intelligence" had a rather dystopian prosody in science fiction from the mid-20th century but has gained a more positive association recently with advancements in useful AI technologies. The time period in which texts were published as well as the prevailing opinions at the time thus significantly impact their semantic prosodies.

Finally, authors often use linguistic devices such as noun phrases and dysphemism to subtly persuade readers and influence semantic prosodies. Repeatedly associating a phrase with a particular noun phrase creates an implied connection in readers' minds. For example, a politician may frequently use the noun phrase "illegal aliens" after discussing "immigration reform" to give it a more negative semantic prosody. Similarly, dysphemistic metaphors are used to sway semantic prosodies; referring to immigration as a "tsunami" or "flood," for instance, activates the reader's fear and disgust to negatively influence their perception of the issue.

In summary, semantic prosody analysis using an electronic corpus provides many useful findings but several factors affect the results. The genre, time period and authors' use of linguistic tools can all work to shape the semantic prosodies that readers implicitly perceive in various phrases. Researchers should carefully consider how these elements may impact their data and analyses. Overall, online corpora offer a rich trove of information in tracing these semantic and cultural shifts.
