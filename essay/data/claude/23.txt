Critical realism, developed by the philosopher Roy Bhaskar, has had a significant impact on modern sociology. Critical realism provides an ontological framework that asserts that reality exists independently of our knowledge of it. Reality has causal powers and mechanisms that produce observable events, and scientific inquiry aims to discover these mechanisms. For sociology, critical realism offers an alternative to positivist and constructivist perspectives that dominated the field. Critical realism proposes an alternative ontological and epistemological position that provides a foundation for developing theories and evidence that can provide practical contributions to society.

A key proponent of critical realism in sociology is Margaret Archer. Archer has critiqued the ontological assumptions of traditional sociological theories like functionalism and argued that they cannot adequately explain social change and agency. Traditional sociological perspectives treated society and social structure as static, unchanging entities that constrain human agency. In contrast, Archer's morphogenetic approach sees social structures as both the medium and the outcome of social interaction. Structures pre-exist social action but are also transformed by and dependent on the activity of human agents. Through the morphogenetic cycle of structural conditioning, social interaction, and structural elaboration, social structures and human agency are linked in a dynamic relationship. This provides a framework for explaining social change that overcomes static notions of social determination.

The concept of power has been an important issue for critical realists in sociology. Power is a causal mechanism that generates observable events and helps explain outcomes in society. For critical realists, power must be conceptualized as being grounded in structures and relations, not just as a characteristic of human individuals or groups. C. Wright Mills conceptualized power as an institutional rather than personal construct. Power is concentrated in roles and positions inside key social institutions like the economy, the political system, and the military. Mills argued sociologists must critically analyze the institutional sources of power and how power is exercised over certain groups. 

In contrast, Talcott Parsons saw power as diffused throughout the social system in a way that maintained stability and social order. Power was built into the cultural and social norms of society that guided cooperation and consensus. However, this conceptualization was critiqued as being unable to adequately address issues of conflict and constraint in social relations.

Steven Lukes articulated a three-dimensional view of power that has been influential for critical realists. The first dimension is the pluralist view that focuses on observable and overt power struggles in decision making. The second dimension highlights how policy agendas and decisions can be covertly shaped and manipulated by the values and interests of powerful groups. The third dimension is the radical view that the most significant form of power is the ability of powerful groups to shape perceptions, cognitions and preferences in a way that secures compliance and submission to the system of rule. This three-dimensional view provides a framework for developing theories of power that identify the actual causal mechanisms at work in social relations and institutions.

In conclusion, critical realism has provided sociology with an ontological and epistemological framework for developing theories and evidence that can provide practical contributions to society. By conceptualizing reality as consisting of causal mechanisms that are often unobservable, critical realism proposes that sociological inquiry should aim to uncover these mechanisms to explain events in the world. Critical realists argue sociology must move beyond superficial descriptions and correlations to provide causal explanations of social phenomena. Critical realism has influenced approaches like Archer's morphogenetic approach and Lukes' three-dimensional view of power. These perspectives show how critical realism can be used to overcome limitations of previous sociological theories and develop new theories that reconnect human agency and social structures. With its basis in uncovering causal mechanisms, critical realism points to a sociology that can produce knowledge for emancipatory ends. Overall, critical realism provides a promising perspective for developing a sociology that can contribute to society beyond academia.
