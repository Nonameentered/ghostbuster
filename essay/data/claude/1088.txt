Here is a 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

X-ray diffraction is a technique used to determine the structure of crystalline solids—materials that have a highly ordered arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules in a regular, repeating three-dimensional pattern. In X-ray diffraction, X-rays are directed at a crystalline sample and the scattered X-rays are detected and analyzed to determine the arrangement of atoms within the crystal structure. 

There are 14 different types of crystal lattices, which refer to the arrangement of points repeating in three dimensions. The simplest are cubic lattices, including simple cubic, body-centered cubic, and face-centered cubic. Hexagonal lattices have a six-fold symmetry. Tetragonal lattices have rectangular or square axial ratios. Orthorhombic lattices have three unequal axial lengths at right angles. Monoclinic lattices have two axes at right angles and the third at an oblique angle. Triclinic lattices have three unequal axes at oblique angles. Each lattice has a unit cell, the smallest repeating unit, defined by lattice parameters 'a', 'b' and 'c', which represent the lengths of the cell edges.

Miller indices are used to describe lattice planes and the directions between them. They are represented by integers 'h', 'k' and 'l' that are reciprocals of the intercepts the plane makes on the 'a', 'b' and 'c' axes. Only certain lattice planes are allowed based on the symmetry of the lattice. For example, in a cubic system, planes passing through two or more axes are not allowed. The separation between lattice planes 'd' is related to the lattice parameter 'a' through Bragg's Law: nλ=2dsinθ. Where 'n' is an integer, 'λ' is the wavelength of the X-rays, 'd' is the interplanar spacing, and 'θ' is the incident angle.

In an X-ray diffraction experiment, a beam of X-rays is directed at a crystalline sample. The scattered X-rays interfere with each other, and at certain angles the interference is constructive, resulting in a diffracted beam. A detector picks up these diffracted beams which reflect off planes within the crystal at specific angles. These diffracted beams produce spots on the detector which are used to determine the crystal structure. The spots correspond to different lattice planes in the crystal, and their positions and intensities provide information about the size and shape of the unit cell, the symmetry of the lattice, the types of atoms, and their positions within the structure.

The primary equipment used includes an X-ray tube to generate the X-ray beam, a goniometer to rotate and tilt the sample, an X-ray detector, and software to analyze the resulting diffraction pattern. Increasingly, more advanced equipment such as synchrotrons are used to generate very high intensity X-rays for diffraction experiments. 

In summary, X-ray diffraction is a versatile and important technique for determining the arrangement of atoms in crystalline materials. By analyzing the diffraction pattern resulting from X-rays scattered by a crystalline sample, the size and shape of the unit cell, the lattice type, and the positions of atoms within the structure can be deduced. X-ray diffraction has been crucial for understanding structures of inorganic and biological materials that are difficult to determine by other means.
