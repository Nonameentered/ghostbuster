Here is a 750 word essay in response to the prompt:

Modern computer-based engine test systems are extensively used to determine the performance characteristics of engines. Systems such as the CADET allow engineers to investigate operating parameters, generate power and torque curves, and create performance maps for engines. As an example, the Rover K16 1.4 litre engine can be tested on the CADET system to fully explore its capabilities.  

The CADET system is connected to the K16 engine and allows it to be run through a range of speeds and loads. Sensors monitor factors such as engine RPM, throttle position, air and coolant temperatures, and the composition of exhaust gases. From this, the power output and torque of the engine at different RPM levels are measured and plotted on graphs to create power and torque curves. The peak power of 105 horsepower at 6,000 RPM and peak torque of 133 Nm at 4,400 RPM can be identified for the K16 engine.

The CADET system can also generate a performance map for the K16 engine by testing it at varying loads and throttle positions. This map shows how much power and torque the engine can produce at any given RPM and load. From the performance map, the efficiency of the engine can be analyzed based on how much of the theoretical maximum power is generated in practice. Advances in engine technology, such as improved fuel injection, valve actuation, and engine control systems, have allowed the K16 engine to achieve greater power and fuel efficiency than previous engines of a similar displacement.  

In summary, modern test systems like CADET provide engineers extensive data on engine performance. They can measure power and torque outputs over a range of speeds to produce characteristic curves for the engine. Performance maps can also be created to show how the engine performs under different loads at any RPM. Analyzing this data allows for insights into the efficiency and advantages of new technologies employed in engines like the K16. Continual progress in engine performance and fuel economy is enabled by these sophisticated test systems.
