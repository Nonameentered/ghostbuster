Conventional pest control methods in rice production systems, such as the use of synthetic pesticides, have led to several unintended consequences that threaten the sustainability of rice farming in Southeast Asia. Pesticides have been shown to negatively impact human health, harm beneficial insects and the environment, and promote the development of pesticide resistance in pests and weeds. In response, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies have been developed that aim to minimize the use of pesticides and promote biological control methods. 

IPM incorporates multiple pest control tactics, including cultural practices, biological control agents, host plant resistance, and selective use of pesticides. A key goal of IPM is to suppress pest populations to tolerable levels using natural biological control methods as much as possible, reserving pesticide use only when populations exceed economic thresholds. IPM has been shown to reduce pesticide use by up to 90% while still controlling pests effectively. In rice production, IPM emphasizes practices such as enhancing natural enemies of pests through providing habitat for predatory and parasitic insects, using disease-resistant and pest-tolerant rice varieties, and improving crop rotation and field sanitation to remove alternate pest hosts.

Recent research has led to promising new biological control methods for rice pests and weeds that can be integrated into IPM programs. For example, researchers have had success controlling the rice water weevil, a major early-season pest, using a parasitic nematode. Other studies have shown that altering the time of day that rice fields are flooded can significantly reduce rice water weevil populations. New weed control methods include the use of weed-eating fish and application of fungal pathogens that attack weeds. These types of biological controls are compatible with IPM and organic programs and help further reduce dependence on pesticides.

Land management techniques also play an important role in biological control and IPM in rice farming. Maintaining biodiversity in and around rice fields provides habitat for natural enemies of pests and weeds. Leaving unmowed field margins and not burning rice straw after harvest supports natural enemy populations. Planting nectar-producing plants also provides natural enemies with food sources, allowing them to sustain themselves even when prey populations are low. These techniques, combined with the use of biological control agents and pest-resistant plant varieties, have been shown to effectively regulate pest and weed populations in rice production systems, reducing the need for pesticide applications.

In summary, conventional pest control methods in rice production are unsustainable and have led to issues like pesticide resistance, environmental damage, and harm to human health. IPM and biological control techniques that incorporate habitat management, natural enemies of pests, use of resistant plant varieties and sustainable practices offer an alternative that supports the natural regulation of pest populations with minimal pesticide use. Recent research on new biological control methods for key rice pests and weeds provides more options for IPM programs to draw from to meet the goal of sustainable pest management in rice production. Overall, the integration of these IPM and biological control strategies can significantly reduce dependence on pesticides while maintaining or even improving yields.
