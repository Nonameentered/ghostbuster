The differential diagnoses for an elderly man presenting to the emergency department after a fall and inability to move or walk include:

- Hip fracture: The most likely diagnosis is a fracture of the hip, specifically a broken femur (thighbone) near the hip joint. Hip fractures are common in elderly patients due to osteoporosis and increased fall risk. The type of hip fracture, such as displaced versus non-displaced and intra- versus extracapsular, determines the treatment approach and prognosis. Displaced and extracapsular fractures typically require surgical fixation and have higher risks of poor outcomes. 

- Leg fracture: Alternative possibilities include fractures of the tibia, fibula or knee. Fractures further down the leg are less likely to cause complete inability to walk but would still require immobilization and possible surgery based on the break.

- Spinal injury: Damage to the spine such as a compression fracture could also lead to loss of leg function and mobility. Spinal injuries require emergent imaging and consultation with a spine specialist.

- Nerve or muscle injury: Rarely, trauma could cause damage to major nerves or muscles in the leg resulting in temporary loss of strength and control. This would require neurological and orthopedic assessment to determine appropriate management.

For an elderly patient, the risks associated with any fracture are higher due to slower healing, higher surgical risks, and decreased mobility and independence. Close monitoring in hospital and possible inpatient rehabilitation or skilled nursing facility care are often required, especially for hip fractures. The patientâ€™s home environment and available social support also significantly impact safety for discharge and ability to avoid institutionalization.

In the UK, the prevalence of hip fractures is over 70,000 per year and rising with the aging population. The primary causes are falls from standing height, often due to balance problems, muscle weakness, poor eyesight, or environmental hazards. Osteoporosis also plays a major role by causing bone fragility. 

To optimize outcomes, a multi-disciplinary team including orthopedic surgeons, physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers, and care managers should work closely together. Surgical repair, mobilization, physical therapy, fall prevention, nutrition, pain management, and discharge planning are all complex components requiring coordination across disciplines for the best chance of success. Overall, for an elderly man with limited mobility after a fall, there are many possible explanations but a hip fracture is most likely and requires prompt diagnosis, treatment and team management to return to function and independence.
