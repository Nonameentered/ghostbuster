WinCoot is a software tool used to refine and build molecular models based on electron density maps. An electron density map is a 3D representation of the electron density in a macromolecule such as a protein, generated using X-ray crystallography. WinCoot allows researchers to manually adjust and build a model by manipulating individual atoms and amino acid residues to best fit the electron density. 

The structure of lysozyme consists of two domains: an alpha domain and a beta domain. The alpha domain contains four alpha helices and the beta domain contains an anti-parallel beta sheet. Lysozyme's function is to break down bacterial cell walls by hydrolyzing the beta (1-4) glycosidic linkage between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. Binding of the substrate maltose induces a conformational change in lysozyme that opens up the active site for catalysis.

The active site of lysozyme contains several charged amino acids including Asp52, Glu35, Asp101 and Arg21 which are important for substrate binding and catalysis. When maltose binds, it likely occupies the cleft between the alpha and beta domains where the active site is located. However, without an electron density map and model from a maltose-bound structure, we cannot say definitively how maltose alters the active site.

In refining the model of lysozyme several errors were found and resolved. For example, some amino acids were in the wrong orientation or position that did not match the electron density. By manually adjusting and reorienting these amino acids in WinCoot, a better fit to the density was achieved. Potential errors can occur in model building from misinterpreting blurry or low-resolution density or by placing the incorrect amino acid type at a location in the map.

In the final model, several structural features were observed. For example, alpha helices were characterized by distinctive helical density for the backbone and side chains protruding outward. Beta sheets showed an elongated strand-like density with side chains oriented above and below the sheet. Certain amino acids like tryptophan had clearly defined ring structures due to the presence of aromatic rings. These and other features gave clues to properly build and refine the lysozyme model using the electron density map in WinCoot.

In summary, WinCoot is a molecular modelling tool used to manually build and adjust protein models to best fit an electron density map determined by X-ray crystallography. By describing the structure of lysozyme, its active site, the binding of maltose, errors found and resolved in the model, and characteristics of certain amino acids, this essay provides an overview of how WinCoot can be used to properly refine an electron density map into an accurate molecular model.
