Bertolt Brecht was one of the most influential playwrights of the 20th century. Dissatisfied with the traditional genre of naturalism that aimed to create an illusion of reality on stage, Brecht developed his own unique dramatic theory called 'epic theatre.' Unlike naturalism, epic theatre aimed to engage the audience in a critical examination of the plays’ themes and subjects. Brecht believed that theatre should not simply reflect the world but actively work to change it. Throughout his career, Brecht's plays grew increasingly politically charged as he incorporated Marxist philosophy and addressed the socio-political issues of Weimar Germany in the 1920s. By analyzing three of Brecht's plays – The Threepenny Opera, The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, and Mother Courage and Her Children – we can trace Brecht's development of epic theatre and see how he used it to challenge audiences and advance his vision of politically engaged theatre.

In the early 1920s, Brecht broke onto the Berlin theatre scene with his first major success The Threepenny Opera, a Marxist reinterpretation of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera. Set in Victorian era London, the play follows the bandit Macheath and his criminal companions. While the play is an entertaining satire of capitalism and the bourgeoisie, Brecht's use of epic theatre techniques is relatively limited compared to his later works. The play incorporates songs that interrupt the narrative and distance the audience, and the set design is sparse and minimalistic. However, the play still embraces some naturalist conventions, focusing on creating lively characters and music to entertain audiences rather than directly engaging them in social critique.

Brecht's next play The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny incorporated more overt use of epic theatre and demonstrated a growing interest in cultural criticism. Set in a fictional pleasure city, the play satirizes consumerism and greed in capitalistic societies. Brecht employed several epic theatre techniques to break audiences' passive enjoyment of the play including setting changes in full light, projection of song titles and captions, and direct address to the audience. With its critique of capitalism, the opera confirms Brecht's Marxist awakening and penchant for using theatre as a way to advance political ideas. However, Brecht faced criticism for the play's controversial themes, foreshadowing the obstacles he would continue to face in advocating for a politically engaged theatre.

Mother Courage and Her Children, often considered Brecht's greatest work, exemplifies his mastery of epic theatre and use of theatre to expose injustice and effect change. Set during the Thirty Years' War, the play follows Mother Courage as she follows the war in her canteen wagon, attempting to profit while losing all her children to the war. Using a range of epic techniques, including songs, projection of captions, limited scenery, and actors directly criticizing their characters, Brecht prevents audiences from becoming emotionally invested in the play. Instead, these techniques encourage critical reflection on the play's themes of war, capitalism, and moral responsibility. Through its historical setting, the play illustrates how political conflict shapes society and individuals' lives while also drawing parallels to fascist Germany in the late 1920s and 1930s. Of Brecht's plays, Mother Courage is most successful in inspiring audiences to take political action against oppression and injustice in their own time period.  

In conclusion, Brecht's plays grew increasingly politically charged over the course of his career as he honed his theory of epic theatre. From The Threepenny Opera to Mother Courage and Her Children, Brecht incorporated more Marxist ideology and use of epic techniques to actively engage audiences in social and political critique. Caught in the tumultuous atmosphere of 1920s Germany, Brecht's vision was that theatre could reflect the world's ills and provoke audiences into changing them. Through plays focusing on morality, greed and war, Brecht demonstrated the potential for theatre to inspire action against oppression and advance ideological change. Overall, Brecht established himself as a pioneer of political theatre and proved that drama could make a vital impact on society.
