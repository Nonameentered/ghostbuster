Ambiguity refers to linguistic expressions that have more than one meaning or interpretation. Ambiguity is an inherent feature of natural language, and there are several types that manifest in different ways. Lexical ambiguity refers to words that have multiple meanings, such as "bank" to mean either a financial institution or the land alongside a river. Structural ambiguity arises from grammatical constructions that can be interpreted in multiple ways, e.g. "I saw the man with binoculars" which can mean either a man possessing binoculars or seeing a man by means of binoculars. Semantic ambiguity results from semantic categories or concepts that have fuzzy boundaries or overlap, such as "heap" or "tall". Phonological ambiguity refers to words with different meanings that are pronounced the same way such as "there" versus "their". 

Ambiguity differs from vagueness, which refers to expressions that lack clear or definite meaning and cannot be resolved to a single interpretation, e.g. "somewhat helpful". Ambiguity also differs from deixis, which refers to expressions whose meaning depends on context. Deictic expressions like "tomorrow" and "this" are inherently vague until context provides a resolution, whereas ambiguous expressions have discrete potential meanings that can be listed. Ambiguity may arise from or interact with both vagueness and deixis in some cases.

Understanding ambiguity is important in linguistics for several reasons. First, ambiguity highlights the flexibility and creativity of language. Second, ambiguity poses a substantial challenge for natural language processing as machines struggle to interpret ambiguous input or generate unambiguous output. Third, ambiguity provides a window into how humans interpret and resolve incompatible meanings, which relies primarily on context and pragmatic reasoning. Fourth, ambiguity can be a source of humor, poetry, and creative language use when intended and recognized as such.

In summary, the basic types of ambiguity include lexical, structural, semantic, and phonological ambiguity. Ambiguity leads to multiple possible interpretations, unlike the clear resolution that vagueness and deixis allow when contextualized. Studying ambiguity provides insights into the complexity of human language, the difficulties of computational linguistics, and the cognitive mechanisms that allow humans to navigate ambiguous communication. With examples and analysis, this essay has aimed to disambiguate the notion of ambiguity itself to illustrate why understanding this linguistic phenomenon is so important.
