Free radicals are unstable atoms or molecules with unpaired electrons that have the potential to damage DNA, proteins, and lipids in the body. They are typically either oxygen-or nitrogen-centered molecules formed during normal metabolism as well as in response to environmental pollutants or radiation. Because they are unbalanced, free radicals attempt to acquire electrons to attain stability, which can lead to a chain reaction of oxidation that results in cellular damage.

Free radicals are capable of damaging DNA by inducing single-strand breaks, double-strand breaks, purine and pyrimidine modifications, and DNA cross-linking. DNA damage caused by free radicals has been implicated in the development and progression of cancer as well as age-related degenerative diseases. Free radicals can also damage proteins by oxidizing amino acids and breaking protein strands, which alters protein structure and function. They may oxidize polyunsaturated fatty acids in lipids, leading to lipid peroxidation that compromises cell membrane integrity and produces harmful byproducts like malondialdehyde.

Antioxidants help prevent oxidative damage by neutralizing excess free radicals and their harmful effects in the body. They either stabilize free radicals by donating an electron or break the chain reaction of oxidation before damage is done. Common dietary antioxidants include vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein, and various flavonoids. These antioxidants may be obtained through consumption of a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. For example, citrus fruits and tomatoes are high in vitamin C; nuts, seeds, avocados, and sweet potatoes provide vitamin E; and carrots, spinach, kale, and broccoli contain high amounts of beta-carotene. 

In addition to well-known antioxidants like vitamins and carotenoids, plant foods are also rich in phytochemicals that may function as antioxidants. These include compounds such as anthocyanins, quercetin, curcumin, and resveratrol, among others. Phytochemicals are thought to contribute to the health benefits of diets high in fruits and vegetables, which tend to be associated with a lower risk of cancer. Several potential mechanisms by which phytochemicals may protect against cancer have been proposed, including enhancing antioxidant activity, altering carcinogen metabolism, influencing hormone activity, and promoting cell cycle arrest or apoptosis of abnormal cells. By scavenging free radicals and modulating other cancer-related processes, antioxidants and phytochemicals from plant-based foods provide defenses against DNA damage, uncontrolled cell growth, and other cellular changes that can lead to malignant transformation and tumor development.

In summary, free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage DNA, proteins, and lipids in the body through oxidative reactions. Antioxidants like vitamins, carotenoids and phytochemicals found in plant foods help neutralize free radicals and minimize oxidative damage. A diet rich in fruits and vegetables, which are abundant in antioxidants and phytochemicals, may confer protection against cancer and other chronic diseases in part due their ability to defend against free radical-induced cell injury.
