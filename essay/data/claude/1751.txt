Liza Dalby's ethnography "Geisha" provides a critical examination of the cultural misperceptions commonly held about geisha. Outside of Japan, geisha have often been exoticized, portrayed as submissive courtesans trained in the art of pleasing men. Dalby delves deep into the actual lifestyle and attitudes of geisha in Kyoto in the 1970s to reveal a much more complex picture. 

First, geisha are not prostitutes or courtesans. While in previous eras there was more ambiguity between geisha and courtesans, by the 1970s geisha led independent lives focused on entertainment and artistic cultivation. They might choose to take on lovers or patrons, but this was separate from their professional life. Geisha train for years to become skilled in traditional arts like music, dance, conversation, and alcohol serving. Their central purpose is using these arts to entertain and engage in repartee with their guests. Sex has no place in these public interactions. 

Second, geisha are not submissive servants to men's desires. Dalby reveals geisha to be strong, independent businesswomen who choose their own clients and how much to engage with them. While flirtation and lighthearted conversation are part of the job, geisha do not hesitate to reject inappropriate requests or rebuff unwelcome advances from guests. Senior geisha, in particular, command respect for their artistic talents and take pride in their work. They see themselves more as "preservers and performers of traditional arts" than objects of male attention. 

Finally, the geisha world is far more cosmopolitan and progressive than typically imagined. While geisha are rigorously trained in traditional arts, they lead modern lives in contemporary Japan. Many were educated, well-traveled, and socially progressive. Geisha establishments in the 1970s also adapted with the times, serving Western alcohol, allowing more casual dress at times, and talking with guests about world events. The geisha profession was declining but sought to attract new clients to traditional arts through these updates. 

In the post-war era, the geisha profession has declined significantly due to social changes in Japan. The traditional arts of the geisha struggle to compete with modern, Westernized entertainment. The apprentice system has broken down, with few young girls willing to undergo the arduous training. However, real geisha communities do still exist in Kyoto and Tokyo to preserve these cultural traditions. A few successful geisha houses have even emerged, focusing on an exclusive, high-class clientele.  

While the geisha tradition lives on in a diminished form, Liza Dalby's compelling account remains invaluable. At a time when Japan was reinventing itself in the modern world, Dalby captured geisha life in its full richness and vibrancy. By shedding light on the human dimensions and artistic expressions of geisha, her work dispels the most common misconceptions about this cultural institution. Overall, "Geisha" represents a penetrating and humanizing study of geisha as free-thinking artists charting their own destinies during a pivotal era of Japanese history.
