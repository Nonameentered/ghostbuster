Here is a 1750 word essay in response to the prompt:

The participants in verbs, known as verb arguments, relate closely to semantic roles in a sentence. Semantic roles describe the relationships between a verb and its arguments, identifying who did what to whom. The two main semantic roles are the agent, the initiator of the action, and the patient, the entity affected by the action. Additional semantic roles include instrument, location, recipient, beneficiary, etc. The number and type of semantic roles in a sentence depend on the verb and its arguments.  

Verbs can be categorized based on the number of arguments they take. Intransitive verbs take only one argument, typically an agent, as in “I ran.” Transitive verbs take two arguments, an agent and patient, as in “I kicked the ball.” Ditransitive verbs take three arguments, an agent, patient, and recipient/beneficiary, as in “I gave her a gift.” Some verbs can be used either transitively or intransitively, with a difference in meaning, e.g. “The vase broke” (intransitive) vs. “I broke the vase” (transitive).

The subject of a verb, especially an intransitive or transitive verb, typically fills the agent role, as the initiator of the action. For example, in “I ran,” “I” is the subject and agent. In “I kicked the ball,” “I” is again the subject and agent. The object of a transitive verb usually fills the patient role, as the entity affected by the action. So in “I kicked the ball,” “the ball” is the object and patient. 

Ditransitive verbs, with two objects, may assign recipient/beneficiary roles to the indirect object. For example, in “I gave her a gift,” “her” is the indirect object and recipient, while “a gift” is the direct object and patient. The recipient is the person who receives or benefits from the direct object. Some ditransitive verbs like “owe” or “promise” imply a recipient/beneficiary but do not actually take an indirect object. In “I owe you money” or “I promised you a reward,” “you” fills the recipient role but functions as the object, not indirect object.

Other semantic roles that arguments may fill include instrument, location, theme, result, etc. The instrument is the means by which an action is carried out, e.g. “I wrote the letter with a pen.” The location specifies where an action occurs, e.g. “We had dinner at the restaurant.” The theme is what an action or process is about, e.g. “We talked about politics.” The result is what comes from an action, e.g. “The explosion produced a loud noise.”

In summary, semantic roles identify the relationships between a verb and its arguments. The number and type of arguments a verb takes determines its potential semantic roles. While subjects and objects typically fill agent and patient/theme roles, other semantic roles are also possible, depending on the specific verb and syntax. The diversity of semantic roles demonstrates the richness and complexity of meaning in natural language.
