Montaigne's prefatory address 'To the Reader' introduces many of the central themes that he explores in depth throughout his Essays. Specifically, in 'On repenting' and 'On liars' Montaigne examines the themes of the self, truth and lies, repentance, and human nature. From the outset, Montaigne establishes a direct and intimate relationship with the reader that creates trust and emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and understanding human nature.

In 'To the Reader', Montaigne argues that the subject of his book is himself, declaring that he is "the matter of [his] book". By framing his work around his own imperfect self, Montaigne invites the reader into a relationship of equality and shared fallibility. His humble and self-deprecating style puts the reader at ease, as evident in his admission that he finds "no great generosity in [men's] compositions". This approachable and relatable style engages the reader and makes them more open to consider the themes Montaigne explores.

The theme of 'self' is introduced immediately as Montaigne states that his imperfect self is the subject of the book. In 'On repenting', Montaigne reflects deeply on himself and examines his character with honesty and vulnerability. He shares insight into his process of self-examination, confessing "I plunge myself in myself", and shares personal habits and inclinations without pretence.

By the end of 'On repenting', Montaigne offers the reader access to a nuanced and intimate understanding of himself, inviting them to embark on the same project of self-study.

The topic of liars and truth is another theme addressed directly in 'To the Reader' and examined in 'On liars'. Montaigne warns the reader that just as in society, in his book they will encounter sections that are "either false or uncertain".  He makes no pretence of imparting absolute truths, admitting his own mind is as prone to error as any other. In 'On liars' Montaigne explores humanity's relationship with truth, arguing our condition naturally predisposes us to lying, stating "the reverse of what we have just said...seems to us true". He ultimately suggests that some lies may be harmless or even advantageous, as long as one remains devoted to virtue...
