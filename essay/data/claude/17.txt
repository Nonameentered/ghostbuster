Cultural representations, including art, music, literature, and film, were instrumental in shaping national identities in Latin America in the 1930s. In Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, the rise of popular nationalism was reflected in and amplified by cultural works that deliberately crafted a sense of shared national identity. 

In Argentina, the tango music and dance became a powerful expression of popular nationalism and cultural pride in the 1930s. Early tangos had lampooned the Argentine elite, but over time they evolved into patriotic anthems celebrating Argentine identity. Songs like "Cambalache" lamented the state of the nation but also stirred national pride, while "Adios Nonino" became an unofficial second national anthem. The tango was seen as a uniquely Argentine creation, and its rising prestige reflected a growing sense of national identity and cultural self-confidence.

In Brazil, nationalist sentiments were cultivated through the promotion of samba music and Carnival celebrations. Samba songs, especially those from the 1930s, glorified Brazil's natural beauty, cultural heritage, and racial mixing. Carnival parades also became highly nationalistic, with samba schools adopting names like "Brazil of Yesterday and Today." Getúlio Vargas, Brazil's populist leader, keenly promoted samba and Carnival as symbols of national unity and pride in Brazil's cultural traditions.

In Mexico, cultural nationalism was most vividly expressed through murals and films. Artists like Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and José Clemente Orozco painted large murals, many commissioned by the government, celebrating Mexican history, folklore, and indigenous heritage. Their murals tied a modern Mexican identity to an ancient and glorified past. Films, especially historical epics, also constructed a sense of shared national identity by highlighting iconic events and figures in Mexico's history.

In all three countries, these cultural representations helped forge a new form of nationalism that was popular, sentimental, and accessible. They tapped into emotions of cultural pride, heritage, and homeland in a way that transcended social classes. While elites had long claimed national identities, popular culture allowed ordinary people to feel a powerful sense of belonging to the nation. The rise of radio, film, and public art gave these cultural expressions a wide audience, allowing them to shape national identities on a mass scale.

Popular nationalism was a defining force in 1930s Latin America. In Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, culture was not just a reflection of this new nationalism—it was the means through which national identities were constructed, spread, and instilled in the popular imagination. Cultural representations were thus instrumental in forging a sense of shared national belonging during this pivotal decade.
