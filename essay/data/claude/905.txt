The concepts of the 'Developmental State' and the 'Competition State' have been influential in understanding the economic growth and development of East Asian countries in the post-World War 2 era. The developmental state refers to a state that actively intervenes in the economy to promote growth and industrialization. The competition state is a later concept that refers to a state's focus on enhancing national competitiveness in an era of globalization. 

In the decades following WW2, states like Japan, South Korea, and Singapore adopted a developmental state model. They had authoritarian governments that worked closely with the private sector to invest in key industries, promote exports, and drive rapid economic growth. In Japan, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) spurred the growth of major Japanese corporations and promoted technology transfers. In South Korea, the government aggressively invested in 'chaebols' or large business conglomerates to develop industries like steel, shipbuilding, and electronics. In Singapore, the state Economic Development Board attracted foreign investment and developed the port infrastructure and financial sector.

However, by the 1990s, globalization and economic openness meant that these states could no longer rely on domestic policy levers alone. They had to become 'competition states' that focused on making their economies attractive to foreign investors and boosting national competitiveness. This involved deregulation, liberalization, and incentives for innovation. Singapore pursued biotech, education, and cultural development to compete based on talent and knowledge. South Korea promoted tech startups and creative industries. Japan pursued university reform and scientific research to drive innovation.

While the concepts of developmental and competition states are useful, they also have limitations. They suggest a high degree of coherence and competence within states that is unrealistic. In reality, there are competing interests within the government, and policymaking is often fragmented. They also imply that states can control and direct the economy when in fact global markets and private sector interests constrain state influence. Finally, they underplay the importance of historical and cultural factors, as well as a country's position within global supply chains, in shaping economic models.

In conclusion, while developmental and competition states have transformed East Asia's economies, the reality is more complex than these concepts suggest. A country's economic structure depends on the interaction between state policy, market forces, and other historical and cultural factors. Going forward, East Asia's states will have to keep balancing economic openness with policies that support continued development of human capital and technological capability. Overall, state and society will both play key and mutually dependent roles in meeting the challenges of global competition.
