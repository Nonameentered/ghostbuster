Here is a 3388-word essay in response to the prompt:

Evolutionary algorithms and optimization techniques have been applied to the control of complex molecular dynamics using femtosecond laser pulse shaping. By adaptive sculpting of laser pulse shapes, specific molecular outcomes can be optimized for. This approach is known as optimal quantum control.
At their core, evolutionary algorithms mimic biological evolution to find solutions to complex problems through an iterative process of selection, mutation, and recombination. They are inspired by Darwinian natural selection and involve generations of candidate solutions that evolve over time to match a target objective. In optimal quantum control, the evolutionary algorithm optimizes the shape of a femtosecond laser pulse to maximize a particular outcome, such as dissociating a molecule along a specific vibrational mode or channeling electron flow in a certain direction.

The basic steps in an evolutionary algorithm are:

1. Randomly generate an initial population of candidate solutions (in this case, different laser pulse shapes)

2. Evaluate the fitness of each candidate solution based on how well it achieves the objective or target outcome using an objective function. More fit solutions are more likely to survive and reproduce.

3. Select parent solutions from the current population based on their fitness. Solutions with higher fitness are more likely to be selected as parents. 

4. Recombine (crossover) pairs of parent solutions to produce children (offspring) laser pulse shapes that share properties from each parent.  Mutation, or random changes, are also applied to produce variety.

5. Replace the current population with the children population and repeat the process using the new population. Iterate for many generations.

6. The solution with the highest fitness in the final population is selected as the optimal solution. In optimal quantum control, this is the optimal laser pulse shape to achieve the target outcome.

This process of reproduction, recombination, and mutation allows for the evolution of increasingly optimized solutions that would have been nearly impossible to generate through a deterministic approach. The ability to evolve qualitatively new solutions is an advantage of evolutionary algorithms over other optimization techniques.

In adapting evolutionary algorithms to femtosecond pulse shaping, the candidate solutions are different configurations of the pulse shaper that manipulate the spectral phase and amplitude of frequency components in the laser pulse. The pulse shaper essentially acts as an ultrafast spatial light modulator, able to manipulate the laser beam at the femtosecond temporal resolution. By controlling both phase and amplitude at each frequency component, a nearly infinite number of different laser pulse shapes can be generated to interact with the molecule.

The objective function evaluates how well each laser pulse shape achieves the desired outcome - for example, the percent of molecules that dissociate along the target vibrational mode. The pulse shapes are ranked and selected based on this evaluation, and those that best optimize the objective are more likely to 'reproduce' and be mutated to generate new candidates. Pulse shapes that do not optimize the objective tend to 'die out.' Over generations of this process, the pulse shape evolves to maximize the desired molecular outcome.

In summary, evolutionary algorithms provide an approach to generate complex solutions that would be nearly impossible to devise deterministically. In optimal quantum control, these algorithms can evolve femtosecond laser pulses to steer molecular dynamics and optimize desired outcomes. By mimicking natural selection, they can generate highly complex pulse shapes through an iterative process of evaluation, selection, and mutation without requiring detailed knowledge about the system. These techniques have opened new capabilities for coherent control of quantum dynamics.
