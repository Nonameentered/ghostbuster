Modernist writers employed a variety of techniques to convey the unrepresentable horrors of World War I. As Virginia Woolf wrote, "On or about December 1910 human character changed." The catastrophe of the war demanded new ways of expressing human experience. Key techniques modernist writers used include:

Fragmentation and collage. Rather than representing the war through coherent, linear narratives, writers reflected its disjointed and fractured nature through fragmentary forms. Siegfried Sassoon's collection The Memoirs of George Sherston uses short, episodic chapters to capture the fragmentation of experience in the trenches. Images, impressions, and sensory details are juxtaposed to evoke the lack of continuity or meaning.  

New uses of language. Writers exploited the symbolic and sonic qualities of language to gesture at what could not be literally described. Imagery of rot, rust, slime and ooze pervades Wilfred Owen's poems, echoing the decay of bodies and minds. In "Dulce et Decorum Est," the "gargling" of the dying man's lungs and "blood/Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs" create nauseating sounds that convey the obscenity of his death.
 
Irreverent and ironic tones. Writers adopted a cynical, mocking tone to critique the war and expose the gulf between its grim reality and the idealistic language used to promote it. Sassoon's poems like "The General" and "They" use biting satire to attack incompetent leaders and condemn the public's ignorant support of the war. His poem "Suicide in the Trenches" drips with irony in calling death an "escape" when the soldiers "gave their lives" for "the good cause."

Focus on suffering and death. Remarque's novel All Quiet on the Western Front is a bleak portrait of the extreme suffering, violence, and death of the war. Remarque graphically describes the deaths of the protagonist's friends to hammer in the sheer meaningless waste of human life. The novel is a protest against both the war itself and the political leaders and citizens whose ignorance and foolish ideals led to its prolongation.  

Through these techniques, modernist writers produced works that gestured at the unrepresentable horrors of World War I and allowed readers to glimpse its cataclysmic impact on human consciousness. Their fragmentary, ironic styles and focus on suffering exposed the moral and physical wreckage of the first industrialized global war.
