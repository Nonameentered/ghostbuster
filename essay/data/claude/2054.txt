Here is a draft 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

Archaeology has greatly expanded our understanding of the medieval peasant. Prior to the rise of archaeology as an academic discipline, historians relied primarily on written records from the medieval period to understand society during that time. However, these records were largely generated by and focused on the nobility and ecclesiastical institutions. The lives of ordinary peasants were rarely documented in the historical record. 

Archaeology has helped fill in these gaps by uncovering physical evidence of how medieval peasants lived, worked, and died. Excavations of peasant villages, farmsteads, and cottages have revealed details about how people lived and worked. Evidence of the layouts of buildings, the types of tools and pottery used, the crops and animals raised, and more provide insights into the daily experience of the medieval peasant.

For example, excavations of peasant houses and cottages show that they were typically made of wood, mud, and thatch, with earthen floors and few windows. Most were a single room, sometimes with an additional room used as a pantry or for storage. The simplicity of these dwellings highlights the impoverished conditions in which many peasants lived. Yet the proximity to orchards, gardens, barns and pens also shows how closely tied peasant life was to the land and the management of resources to survive.

Beyond housing, tools, artifacts, and environmental evidence found at village and farmstead sites demonstrate the types of work peasants engaged in and crops and livestock they raised. Most were subsistence farmers, growing crops like wheat, barley, oats, and raising pigs, cattle, and sheep. Artifacts like sickles, scythes, threshing tools indicate the labor-intensive nature of farming, while remains of grains and animals confirm the types of crops and livestock in use. 

Peasant cemeteries and skeletal remains also provide insights into aspects of peasant life difficult to glimpse from any other source. Skeletal analysis shows the hard lives of physical labor many peasants endured from an early age. In many cases, growth defects indicate lack of nutrition and the presence of disease was widespread. Peasant graves also often contain personal objects revealing more individual expressions amid these difficult lives.

In sum, archaeology has been instrumental in building a more complete understanding of the medieval peasant. Material evidence from excavations supplements the limited written record and helps bring to life the texture of the hard but personal experiences of the peasantry. Their housing, means of survival, the conditions of their lives, and what gave meaning within their communities can emerge through the artifacts, ecofacts, and structures uncovered through careful archaeological research. Archaeology provides a vivid complement to history in enriching our understanding of peasants and all people from the Middle Ages.
