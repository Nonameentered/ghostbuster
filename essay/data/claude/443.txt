Here is a draft essay response in roughly 1250 words to the prompt:

Silver mining played a crucial role in Mexico's development during the colonial period from the 1520s until 1810. The abundance of silver deposits in central and northern Mexico and the heavy reliance on forced indigenous labor made silver mining very profitable for the Spanish colonizers. This fueled the growth of Mexico's economy but it came at a devastating human cost, as countless indigenous Mexicans perished while working in the mines under horrendous conditions. 

Soon after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, the first major silver deposit was found at Taxco in central Mexico. This discovery spurred prospecting and led to even more massive finds, especially around Zacatecas in north-central Mexico. Silver mining grew rapidly and became the primary economic activity for colonial Mexico. The prolific mines of Zacatecas made it one of the largest cities in Mexico. Silver production exploded from around 15 million pesos in the 1560s to over 63 million pesos by the end of the 17th century.

This silver boom was a boon for the Spanish crown. The king claimed ownership over all mineral deposits and took the quinto real, a 20% tax on all silver extracted in Mexico. This amounted to millions of pesos per year for the Spanish empire and funded its trade with China and other activities. The influx of American silver also caused periods of inflation in Spain and affected its economy.

For Mexico itself, silver mining was both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it attracted Spanish settlers and spurred the growth of colonial cities like Zacatecas, Guanajuato, and San Luis Potos√≠. Silver funded the establishment of new agricultural estates and ranchos, which produced food and goods to supply the mining towns. However, the human cost was staggering. The mines required vast amounts of cheap labor, which the Spanish provided through the encomienda system that forced indigenous Mexicans into labor. Working conditions were deplorable and deadly - historians estimate over half of all workers in some mines perished. The disruption from mining also undercut agricultural production and traditional ways of life for many native communities.

In conclusion, silver mining was instrumental in spurring economic activity and urban growth in Mexico during the colonial period. However, its heavy reliance on the forced labor of indigenous populations and the immense human suffering it caused also made it a morally problematic base for Mexico's economy that contributed to the wider destructive impact of Spanish rule. Mexico's post-independence struggles to build a new economy independent of silver mining reflected the complex legacy of this period.
