Here is a 1500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Sociolinguists study how social variables such as gender, class, age, and ethnicity influence the way people speak in verbal communication. Two of the most studied social variables are gender and social class. Sociolinguistic research has found clear patterns in how these variables impact language use. 

Gender is one of the most deeply studied social variables in sociolinguistics. Researchers have found significant differences in how men and women speak, especially in informal conversation. Women tend to use more linguistic markers that signal politeness, cooperation, and inclusion. These include hedges like “kind of” and “sort of,” tag questions like “isn't it?,” and politeness markers like “please.” Women also tend to use more intensifiers like “so,” “very,” and “really” when speaking. Men, on the other hand, tend to use more direct and competitive speech. They interrupt more, use more imperatives like “do this” or “don't do that,” and are more likely to avoid markers of uncertainty like hedges.  Studies of gendered language use span many cultures and age groups, showing how pervasive these patterns are.

Social class also impacts how people speak in profound ways. People from working class backgrounds tend to use a more localized, vernacular dialect while people from higher class backgrounds use a more standardized, prestige dialect. This difference in dialect signifies in-group membership and helps establish class-based identities. Vocabulary is another way class is linguistically marked. People from higher classes often use more complex, elaborated vocabulary, even in informal speech, while those from lower classes tend to use a more casual, simplified register. Syntax also varies based on class, with higher classes using more complex sentences with subordination and lower classes relying more on paratactic coordination.   

In conclusion, a person's gender and social class have a significant impact on their language use according to extensive sociolinguistic research. Gender affects aspects of speech like politeness markers, directness, hedging, and intensifiers. Social class impacts the type of dialect, vocabulary, and syntax a speaker prefers. Sociolinguists have found considerable evidence for these patterns across many speech communities and age groups, demonstrating how deeply gender and class variables are connected to verbal communication. Overall, the way we speak is profoundly shaped by our social identities and memberships.
