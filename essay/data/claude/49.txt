Here is a draft 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

Massacres carried out in the twentieth century, such as the Holocaust, Armenian genocide, mass killings in Cambodia and Bosnia, and the Nanjing Massacre, share some common factors but also differ in meaningful ways. By examining these events, we can gain insight into the causes and characteristics of mass violence.

A common factor across these incidents was organized violence perpetrated by governments and groups against civilian populations. In each case, political and military leaders mobilized armed forces to carry out killing of non-combatants on a mass scale. Whether acts of genocide, politicide, or war crimes, these massacres aimed to destroy entire groups of people and were planned and orchestrated by those in power. The violence was not spontaneous but carefully organized to maximize deaths. 

However, the motives and ideologies driving the violence in each case differed. The Holocaust was motivated by Nazi racist ideology that saw Jews as subhuman and an existential threat. The Armenian genocide was also motivated in part by nationalist concerns as the Ottoman government perceived Armenians as a threat to Turkish identity. In contrast, the violence in Cambodia and Bosnia arose more from totalitarian communist ideology and authoritarian urges to exert control over populations by forcibly reshaping society. The Nanjing Massacre was spurred on by an imperial Japanese culture that promoted extreme brutality in war and viewed Chinese as inferior.

The identity of the perpetrators and victims also varied across the cases. In some instances, the state turned against a minority group within its own population, as with Germany persecuting Jews and Turkey targeting Armenians. In other cases, the violence targeted political or social groups, as in Cambodia and Bosnia. The Nanjing Massacre reflected a pattern of the Japanese military attacking civilians of conquered neighboring nations. The perpetrators themselves differed too, from the Nazi and Ottoman governments to the communist Khmer Rouge regime to Serb militias.

The methods of killing and level of efficiency likewise differed. The Holocaust and Armenian genocide incorporated deportation, forced labor, starvation, and mass shootings in the aim of complete annihilation of the victim groups. In Bosnia and Nanjing, killing was more sporadic and decentralized, carried out through random violence, rape, torture, and sporadic murders. The Khmer Rouge regime imposed a reign of terror and used forced labor, starvation, and executions but at a lower total death toll.

In conclusion, while government-organized violence against civilians was a common thread, the massacres of the twentieth century differed substantially in their motivating ideologies, identity of victims and perpetrators, and methods of killing. Examining both their similarities and differences provides insight into how and why such atrocities continue to recur in human society. Overall, no two massacres are exactly alike, but by understanding past events we can work to prevent such horrors from happening again in the future.
