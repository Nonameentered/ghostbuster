Here is a 750-word essay in response to the prompt:

The author's daily diet was tracked for three non-consecutive days and analyzed using several methods to determine macro- and micronutrient intake. The Nutrition Data website was used to look up the nutritional contents of each food and beverage consumed and add up the totals for the day. The results were compared to the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) established by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to determine deficiencies. 

The analysis found the author was deficient in several areas. The calorie intake over the three days averaged only 1,500 calories per day, which is below the estimated average requirement of 2,000 calories per day for most moderately active adult females to maintain weight. The carbohydrate intake was also low at around 45% of total calories compared to the recommended range of 45-65%. The author was not meeting the DRI for dietary fiber, with an average intake of only 15 grams per day compared to the recommendation of 25 grams. For macronutrients, the protein intake was within the normal range but on the lower end at around 15% of total calories.

Several important micronutrients were also lacking. The average vitamin D intake was only 150 IU per day, well below the 600 IU recommendation. Magnesium intake was low at an average of 225 mg per day compared to the 320 mg recommendation for females. Potassium was also lacking at under 2,000 mg per day compared to the 4,700 mg recommendation. These deficiencies could be addressed by making some changes to the diet and supplementing when needed.

Some potential sources of error include inaccuracies in logging all food items, errors in nutritional data for some items, and day-to-day variability in the diet that a three-day analysis may not capture. The results are also based solely on diet and do not consider any nutritional supplements that could help address deficiencies. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the author's nutritional status, a longer-term diet analysis, along with blood testing for certain micronutrients, may be warranted.

In summary, analysis of the author's diet over three days revealed deficiencies in calorie, carbohydrate, fiber, vitamin D, magnesium, and potassium intake. These deficiencies could potentially be remedied through diet changes such as increasing calorie-dense options, eating more high-fiber and magnesium-rich foods, taking a vitamin D and magnesium supplement, using potassium-based salt substitutes, and improving the accuracy and comprehensiveness of dietary logging and analysis. However, there are limitations to a short-term analysis, and more in-depth methods may be needed for a full nutritional assessment.
