A smart home system uses various technologies to automate and monitor home functions remotely for the occupants. Such systems can monitor the environment, detect changes and respond automatically through the use of networked devices. For elderly individuals, a smart home system can provide many benefits to support independent living and ageing in place. 

Two of the main sensors used in a smart home system for the elderly are motion sensors and contact sensors. Motion sensors detect movement and the lack thereof in the home. They can detect if an elderly individual has fallen or is inactive for a prolonged period, indicating a potential emergency situation. Contact sensors attached to doors and cabinets can detect if they have been opened or accessed. By monitoring patterns of activity and detecting deviations, the system can prompt the elderly individuals about daily tasks or detect potential harmful situations. An intensive system with many sensors placed throughout the home is typically used for elderly monitoring to provide detailed information about the individual's activity, habits and wellbeing. An extensive system with fewer, basic sensors may miss critical information required to properly monitor the elderly.

The processing unit, such as a control hub, uses the data from the various sensors to determine if any alerts or actions need to be taken. The software applies algorithms and logic to analyze the sensor data and detect patterns. There are three main sections: data collection, data analysis, and response initiation. The data collection section gathers the raw input from the motion, contact and other sensors. The data analysis section compares the current data to usual activity and schedules to detect any anomalies. If a potential issue is detected, the response initiation section will activate an appropriate alert, reminder or emergency response depending on the situation. For example, if a motion sensor detects no activity from an elderly individual's waking time, the system can first activate an audible alarm as a reminder. If there continues to be no response, the system can send an emergency alert to caretakers or emergency responders. 

In conclusion, a smart home system for the elderly uses motion and contact sensors to monitor daily activity and detect potential issues. An intensive system provides detailed monitoring to enable prompt emergency response. The processing unit applies software logic to gather, analyze the sensor data and initiate appropriate alerts and responses. For the elderly, such a system provides security and peace of mind by reducing risks from sudden medical or hazardous events through continuous monitoring and rapid emergency alerting. With a smart home system, the elderly can maintain independence in their own homes for longer.
