There are several basic requirements that must be considered in the design of a torque measurement system using a torque sensor. The first requirement is to determine what level of accuracy and precision is needed in the measurement of the torque. This requires understanding the specific application and measurements needed to determine the torque sensor resolution and range that must be specified. For a high accuracy measurement, the torque sensor's error and repeatability need to be very low, while for a general purpose measurement these parameters can be more modest.

A second key requirement is determining the torque capacity needed for the application, which establishes the torque sensor maximum rating that must not be exceeded. The torque sensor has to be able to measure the highest anticipated torque in the system without any damage or loss in performance. Often a safety factor is also included to account for any unexpected spikes in the torque. The torque sensor should never be operated at more than its rated maximum capacity. 

The operating speed of the system is another important requirement. The torque sensor must be able to provide accurate measurements at the speeds required by the application. High speed applications require a fast sensor response time and the ability to capture peak torque values, while low speed applications can use a sensor with a slower response. The sensor also needs to be suitable for the environmental conditions of the system including factors such as temperature, humidity, presence of chemicals, and physical vibration or shock. Harsher environments usually require more robust sensor designs and components to handle these conditions.

The interface and signal conditioning required for the torque sensor is also a key requirement to consider. The sensor needs to have an interface, such as voltage output, current output, digital output, etc., that is compatible with the data acquisition and control system used for the application. Any signal conditioning like amplification, filtering or isolation also needs to be provided to prepare the sensor signal for input to the control system devices. 

In summary, the basic requirements for a torque measurement system include determining the needed accuracy, measurement range, operating speed, environmental suitability, and interface for the torque sensor. Specifying a torque sensor that addresses all these requirements will result in an optimal design for a torque measurement system. With the proper selection of a torque sensor and integration into a system, accurate and reliable torque feedback can be achieved.
