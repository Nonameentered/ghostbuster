Contaminated land refers to sites that have been polluted by historical anthropogenic activities and pose risks to human health and the environment. For Spectrum Petrochemicals, contaminated land is a significant issue due to the hazardous chemicals involved in petroleum refining and petrochemical manufacturing. Thorough assessment and remediation of contaminated sites are critical to limit legal liability and ensure the safety and wellbeing of surrounding communities. Spectrum Petrochemicals should utilize a variety of assessment techniques to characterize the nature and extent of contamination at their sites. 

The Love Canal incident in the 1970s highlighted the dangers of contaminated land and spurred new legislation. Love Canal was a neighborhood in Niagara Falls, New York built on top of an abandoned waste disposal site containing 21,000 tons of hazardous waste. Residents reported high rates of disease and birth defects. The site was declared a disaster in 1978 and relocated under the Superfund program. In response, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) was enacted to hold polluters financially accountable for remediation. The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act also required more stringent human health risk assessments following the Significant Pollutant Linkages model which considers complete exposure pathways between contaminants, transport mechanisms, and receptors.

For Spectrum Petrochemicalsâ€™ sites, important assessment techniques include environmental site assessments to review historical records and test for common petroleum contaminants like benzene, lead, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Soil, groundwater, surface water, and sediment sampling can determine contaminant types and concentrations. Benzene and lead are hazardous pollutants of high concern due to their toxicity, mobility, and historical use in petroleum industries. A theoretical risk assessment following the Significant Pollutant Linkages model would consider:

Source (petroleum refining byproducts): Benzene and lead released into the environment.
Mechanism of transport (spills, leaks, wastewater): Contaminants seeping into soil and groundwater, feeding into surface water and sediment. 
Exposure route (dermal contact, inhalation, ingestion): Site workers, trespassers or neighboring communities exposed through direct contact, breathing in or consuming contaminated media.
Receptor (humans, ecosystems): Adverse health impacts like cancer, neurological damage; harm to local plants and wildlife. 

This assessment would determine unacceptable risks requiring remediation to protect human and environmental health. Remediation options include removing contaminated soil, pumping and treating groundwater, covering sites with protective barriers. Institutional controls like fencing and signage can also limit exposure.

In summary, contaminated land poses substantial risks to companies like Spectrum Petrochemicals. Thorough assessment, strict regulation, and responsible remediation are essential to mitigate liability, ensure safety, and promote environmental justice surrounding petrochemical operations. The Significant Pollutant Linkages model and lessons from Love Canal highlight why contaminated site management should remain an ongoing priority for decades to come.
