Here is a 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

The Carolingian Renaissance, spanning roughly the 8th to 9th centuries AD, saw a revival of interest in learning and education in Western Europe, centered around the court of Charlemagne. As part of this revival, Carolingian scholars sought to preserve and disseminate ancient Latin texts, especially those focused on religion, grammar, and philosophy. However, not all texts were copied equally. Several factors contributed to the disparity in which texts were copied, including the social, cultural, and religious values of the Carolingian elite. 

Foremost among these factors was the religious devotion of Charlemagne and his court. Christianity was a cornerstone of Carolingian rule, and thus religious texts were a high priority for copying. The Vulgate Bible was copied frequently, as were texts by Church Fathers like Augustine, Jerome, and Gregory the Great. In contrast, pre-Christian Latin texts on topics like geometry, agriculture, and architecture were rarely copied. The desired texts reflected the piety and intellectual interests of the ecclesiastical scholars who largely dominated education.

 culturally, the Carolingian elite admired the concept of renovatio, or "renewal," of the glories of early Christendom. They saw the Roman Empire as a golden age, and sought to imitate Roman cultural accomplishments like literature, the arts, architecture and jurisprudence. As a result, they focused on copying texts from this period, especially those on grammar, rhetoric, and philosophy, like Cicero, Virgil, Horace, and Boethius. Post-Roman Latin texts were less valued and less frequently copied. 

Socially, education and literacy were marks of high status in Carolingian society. Being able to read, speak, and write a sophisticated level of Latin was essential for advancement in the church hierarchy and government bureaucracy. The types of texts selected for copying and study reflected this, focusing on Latin grammar and rhetoric. 

Most importantly, Carolingian scholars were limited by the availability of texts that had survived from antiquity. They could only copy what they had access too, and many ancient works had been lost. They relied on imperfect lists of authors and titles from writers like Isidore of Seville to choose works to seek out. Without doubt, many potential volumes were unknowingly overlooked.

In conclusion, the copying of Latin texts during the Carolingian Renaissance was shaped by a combination of cultural veneration of early Christendom, the religious devotion of the court, the social prestige of learning, and the limitations of surviving sources. These influences reinforced one another, concentrating scholarly effort on specific types of works, especially Christian, philosophical, and grammatical texts. The end result was an unevenness in which ancient works were copied and transmitted to later generations.
