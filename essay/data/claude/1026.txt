The microprocessor industry operates based on two key rules: Moore's Law and Metcalfe's Law. Moore's Law states that the number of components on integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years, enabling greater processing power and functionality. This pushes companies to continually innovate to keep up with the pace of advancement. Metcalfe's Law states that the value of a network grows exponentially with the number of compatible communicating devices in the network. This creates incentives for companies to gain dominance and control networks and platforms.

These laws drive fierce competition based on innovative capability. Companies must invest heavily in R&D to develop new technologies and more powerful microprocessors to gain a competitive advantage. Innovation impacts all areas of the Porter's Five Forces framework. It raises barriers to entry as new firms must match large incumbents' R&D spending. It impacts the threat of substitutes as more advanced microprocessors can substitute for other components. It impacts buyer power as buyers have more options and can play companies against each other. It impacts supplier power as companies can switch to new components. And it directly impacts the rivalry between Intel and AMD.

In addition to the Five Forces, "complementors" and institutional factors impact competition. Complementors like software developers, computer manufacturers, and cloud platforms influence the adoption of new microprocessors. Government policy around technology standards, trade regulations, and antitrust laws shape how companies can compete.  

Intel, the dominant incumbent, faces limited threats due to these forces and AMD struggles against its strength. Intel controls nearly 80% of the microprocessor market due to its resources, intellectual property, and ecosystem influence. AMD cannot match Intel's $13.6 billion R&D budget or technical capabilities like its in-house foundry. Intel also has deep relationships with complementors and platform control which limits AMD's market access.  

To overcome these challenges, AMD needs a strategic review of its innovation model. It cannot outspend or outpace Intel, so it needs to be more targeted and agile. AMD should focus innovation on high-growth segments of the market underserved by Intel like embedded systems, low-cost PCs and tablets, and high-performance computing. It could build a cost advantage through partnerships rather than internal R&D. It can leverage open technology standards and alliances with complementors to break Intel's hold on platforms and ecosystems. These types of strategic shifts and refocusing of resources could allow AMD to gain more competitive footing despite the strength of its dominant rival.  

In summary, Moore's Law and Metcalfe's Law drive intense competition based on innovation in the microprocessor industry. This competition impacts all areas of Porter's Five Forces framework as well as forces related to complementors and institutions. AMD faces significant threats from its more powerful rival Intel but with a more targeted innovation strategy, it may find ways to successfully compete in underserved market niches, gain cost advantages, and break into Intel's ecosystem control. A strategic review of how it can do more with less may be required for AMD to survive and thrive against a competitor that operates based on scale and dominance.
