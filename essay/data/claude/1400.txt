The Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) is a powerful tool that enables scientists and engineers to image and manipulate matter at the atomic and molecular scale. Some of the most promising applications of STM in nanotechnology involve using the STM tip as a precision engineering tool to create and modify nanostructures atom by atom, as well as to induce and control chemical reactions on individual molecules.

One of the most significant applications of STM manipulation is the construction of atomic-scale structures with specific shapes and electronic properties. By repeatedly moving single atoms or molecules, or by removing them, scientists can design nanostructures that have particular geometries and functions, such as electronic circuits or even gears and motors at the atomic scale. For example, in 1993 scientists at IBM used an STM tip to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms on a nickel surface to spell out the company logo. More recently, scientists created graphene nanoribbons with specific shapes by using an STM tip to etch and remove carbon atoms from sheets of graphene in a precise, controlled fashion.

The STM tip can also be used to synthesize single molecules with well-defined structures by chemically bonding atoms or molecules together on a surface. In 2014, scientists at IBM used an STM tip to manipulate tungsten atoms on a copper surface to synthesize an organometallic compound called PIMBT that has potential medicinal applications. The STM-enabled synthesis of single molecules allows chemists to create and study complex molecular structures that are otherwise difficult to produce in large quantities.

Furthermore, STM manipulation enables scientists to induce and control chemical reactions on an individual molecule level. By applying electric fields or manipulating the STM tip, scientists can efficiently break and form new covalent bonds between atoms and molecules on the surface. For example, in 2015 scientists used an STM tip to activate a single molecule of diisopropylphosphine cadmium bromide and induce it to release one bromine atom and rearrange into a new structure  â€”  simulating an organic reaction on a single-molecule scale. Such reactions provide insights into how molecular reagents behave at the nanometre level and represent a first step toward molecular assembly lines and 3D printers that could manipulate matter on the atomic scale.

An unconventional application of STM is in mechanically-based molecular computation, where the position and movement of atoms are used to represent and process information. The STM tip can be used to "write" data by creating nanostructures with different geometries, and then "read" that data by measuring the positions and features of the nanostructures. The advantage is that mechanisms at this scale can operate at very high speeds and densities. However, STM-based computing is challenging to implement and scale up due to the technical complexity required to manipulate atoms precisely and reliably. Overall, while nascent, STM-enabled computation represents an exciting area of basic research in nanotechnology. 

In conclusion, STM manipulation techniques enable scientists to image, modify, and control matter at the atomic and molecular level in ways that were previously impossible. The technology has the potential to drive further discoveries and advancements in fields ranging from materials science to chemistry to computation. With continued progress, STM could ultimately revolutionize nanotechnology by providing a means to assemble molecules and materials from the bottom up with atom-by-atom precision. However, scaling and implementing such applications remains an open challenge for engineers and researchers.
