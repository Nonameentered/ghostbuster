Shipwrecks from the Viking Age, approximately 800 to 1050 AD, have provided invaluable insights into cultural contacts between societies in north-west Europe during that time period. Several well-preserved shipwrecks have been discovered in recent decades, including the Gokstad ship, Skuldelev ships, and the Roskilde 6 ship. Analysis of artifacts recovered from these shipwrecks has revealed extensive trade networks and cultural exchange between the Vikings and other groups they came into contact with, including the Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and eastern Europeans.

The Gokstad ship, discovered in Norway in 1880, provides evidence of trade between the Vikings and the Anglo-Saxons and Franks. The ship contained the remains of trade goods including glass beakers, buckets, and textiles likely obtained through trade with the British Isles and continental Europe. The ship itself shows a mix of Norse traditions with outside influences in its construction. These trade links between the Norse and other north-west European peoples demonstrate ongoing cultural exchange during this period. 

The Skuldelev ships, an assemblage of five Viking ships discovered in Denmark's Roskilde Fjord, also reflect cultural connections over long distances. The remains of grapes, hazelnuts, and a quern-stone used to grind grain were found on the ships, indicating trade with southern and eastern Europe, as those types of plants and equipment were not native to Scandinavia. Some artifacts on the ships were also of Anglo-Saxon or Frankish origin, again pointing to a trade network linking multiple societies. The diversity of material remains on these ships highlight sustained contact and exchange between different cultural groups in the Viking world and beyond.

The Roskilde 6 ship, discovered in 1996 and dated to the mid-11th century, contained the remains of what appears to have been a chieftain or high-status individual. Among the artifacts found were an ornate sword of Anglo-Saxon design, indicating that elite goods as well as raw materials were being traded over long distances. The ship's construction also reflects a fusion of shipbuilding traditions from throughout the Viking world, including Scandinavia, the British Isles, and the Baltic region. This fusion of styles and influences evidences the mixing of cultures that occurred as a result of Viking expansion and connectedness across wide areas.

In conclusion, shipwrecks from the Viking Age have been instrumental in revealing the extensive trade networks and cultural contacts between the Vikings and other societies in north-west Europe. Artifacts recovered from shipwrecks like the Gokstad ship, Skuldelev ships, and Roskilde 6 illustrate how the Vikings traded and interacted with the Franks, Anglo-Saxons, and various eastern European groups. These archaeological finds demonstrate that the Viking world was closely linked and suggest ongoing cultural exchange and sharing of technologies, styles, and ideas across the region. The Viking longships thus served as agents of connectivity that bound different societies together. Overall, Viking shipwrecks have provided key insights into how cultures come into contact and influence each other.
