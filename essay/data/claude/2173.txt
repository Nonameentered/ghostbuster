Here is a 2000 word essay response to the prompt:

Disney's animated film Hercules, released in 1997, depicts a very different interpretation of the Greek mythological hero Heracles compared to more traditional portrayals in classical films set in ancient Greece and Rome. While the film incorporates many elements of Greek mythology and culture, it adapts and alters the original stories and histories to create a family-friendly film. 

One of the most significant differences is in the characterization of Hercules himself. In Greek mythology, Heracles is a mortal hero, the son of Zeus, king of the gods, and the mortal woman Alcmene. He is a deeply complex and flawed character, often subject to fits of madness and rage. In Disney's version, Hercules is portrayed as a kind-hearted, good-natured, and clumsy teenage boy who is stripped of his immortality as a baby and grows up with mortal parents. He retains his godlike strength but not the complex personality of the original myths. His journey is a lighthearted hero's quest to rejoin the gods on Mount Olympus by proving himself a true hero.

The film also makes major changes to Hercules' famous Twelve Labors, the challenging and often gruesome tasks he must complete to atone for his sins. In the movie, Hercules only completes two of the labors - defeating the Hydra and wrestling the Erymanthian Boar. The other labors are skipped over in a musical training montage. The labors were crucial turning points in the original Heracles myth, showcasing his strength and courage in the face of dangerous beasts and supernatural creatures. Disney's adaptation sanitizes and condenses these pivotal trials.

Disney also makes significant changes to the wider setting and supporting characters in Greek mythology. Mount Olympus and the gods are portrayed in a whimsical, lighthearted fashion. Hades, the villain of the film, is turned into a comic foil obsessed with taking over Mount Olympus. In the original myths, the Underworld which Hades ruled was a grim place, and Hades himself was a stern and foreboding figure, not a humorous villain. The Fates, in mythology grave and powerful deities, are presented as a comic trio of old hags sharing a single eye. And Pain and Panic, Hades' bumbling sidekicks, have no precedent in Greek stories.

While Disney's Hercules makes many sacrifices in faithfulness to the original Greek sources to create an entertaining family film, it does incorporate Greek cultural elements like architecture, pottery, mosaics, and clothing. The music also has some Grecian-inspired touches. However, the true heart of the Greek myths - the complex stories and flawed but heroic characters - is largely lost or diluted for the sake of modern sensibilities. As an introduction to Greek mythology for children, the film has value, but it should not be viewed as an accurate representation of these ancient tales. Overall, Hercules is best appreciated as another entertaining Disney musical adventure rather than a true adaptation of its namesake myth.
