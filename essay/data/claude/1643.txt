The author of the study conducted an observational analysis of the activity budget of a juvenile male chimpanzee at Dudley Zoo in the UK named Kakama. The author used an established ethological observation technique known as continuous focal animal samplingto systematically record Kakama's activities over 126 hours of observation. The author defined over 20 behavioral categories to capture the range of activities that Kakama engaged in, including resting, feeding, locomoting, grooming, playing, and aggression.

The observations found that Kakama spent nearly half of his time (49%) resting, followed by feeding (17%) and locomoting (15%) around his enclosure. Social activities made up a minority of Kakama's time, with playing accounting for 6% of his activity budget and grooming with 3%. Aggressive displays were rarely observed, accounting for less than 1% of his total activity. The observations also revealed that Kakama's activity budget was fairly stable across the different times of day and days of the week. However, some seasonal differences were observed, with slightly more time spent feeding and less time resting during the winter compared to the summer.

The detailed observations provide insight into the activity budget and behavior of a juvenile chimpanzee housed in a captive setting. Nearly half of Kakama's time was spent resting, highlighting the inactivity that can result from living in an enclosure. The observations also serve as an important baseline to compare with wild chimpanzees and evaluate the welfare of captive individuals. The author argues that systematic observational studies of chimpanzees and other primates are crucial to gaining a more complete understanding of their behavioral biology and improving captive care programs. Overall, the study demonstrates how direct observations using a scientifically-validated sampling method can provide a detailed window into the daily activities and behavior of captive animals.

In summary, the author used continuous focal animal sampling to observe the activity budget of a juvenile chimpanzee named Kakama at Dudley Zoo over an extended period. The findings revealed that the chimpanzee spent most of his time resting and feeding, with some time also devoted to locomoting and social activities like playing. The study provides an important understanding of the behavior of captive chimpanzees and how it compares to wild populations. The systematic observation method is a compelling approach for studying animal behavior in zoo settings.
