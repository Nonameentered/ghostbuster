How did relations with the United States and the Soviet Union shape the leftist character of the Mexican Revolution? 

The Mexican Revolution of 1910-1920 was a pivotal moment in Mexico's history that shaped its political trajectory for decades to come. The Revolution began with a wide range of ideological influences and motivations, from agrarianism to anti-imperialism. Over the course of the armed conflict, the radical left gained increasing prominence and influence, pulling the goals and rhetoric of the Revolution in a socialist direction. This leftward turn was strongly influenced by Mexico's complex and often tense relationships with the two major powers of the early 20th century: the United States and the Soviet Union.

Relations between Mexico and the U.S. had long been marked by conflict and mistrust. The U.S. annexation of Texas in 1845 and invasion of Mexico in 1846-1848 resulted in Mexico losing nearly half its territory. In the decades that followed, the U.S. frequently intervened in Mexican affairs to protect American business interests. By the time of the Mexican Revolution, anti-American sentiment was widespread in Mexico. Leaders like Francisco Madero, Pancho Villa, and Emiliano Zapata stoked these nationalist passions with promises to stand up to the "Colossus of the North." Their revolutionary rhetoric was laced with references to loss of land and sovereignty.

When the Revolution broke out in 1910, the U.S. government backed the conservative dictator Porfirio Díaz, fearing the nationalist and anti-capitalist aims of the revolutionaries. Tensions escalated further when rebels like Villa and Zapata threatened U.S. mines and railways in Mexico. In response, the U.S. occupied Veracruz in 1914 and launched the Pancho Villa Expedition into northern Mexico in 1916. These violent interventions generated outrage in Mexico and pushed the revolutionaries to adopt an even harsher stance against U.S. imperialism. To stand against the U.S., many within the revolutionary ranks gravitated toward socialism and found common cause with the new communist Soviet Union.

The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and formation of the Soviet Union gave the Mexican leftists a model for a socialist state independent of U.S. influence. Key figures like Plutarco Elías Calles and Adolfo Gilly were drawn to communist ideas, and the umbrella Constitutionalist faction adopted socialist principles in its Constitution of 1917, calling for limits on Church power, land redistribution, and improved rights for workers. The Soviet Union, in turn, saw Mexico as an opportunity to spread communism globally. It established close ties with the Constitutionalist government, providing both financial and ideological support.

By the end of the armed phase of the Revolution in 1920, the radical left had clearly imprinted its vision on Mexico. The new Constitution established a secular state, curtailed the Church and elite landowners, enfranchised peasants, and embraced labor rights. Mexico proceeded to nationalize its oil industry and implement land reform and collectivisation in line with socialist ideals. Its relations with the U.S. remained strained for decades, while ties to the U.S.S.R. grew closer. In this way, the ideological and geopolitical struggles between the United States and Soviet Union helped polarize the Mexican Revolution and give it a firmly leftist slant that shaped Mexico for generations.
