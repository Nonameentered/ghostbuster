The Gothic novel genre, which became popular in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, is subversive in how it challenges contemporary societal norms and morality. Gothic works explore themes of religion, sexuality, and social class in unconventional and often taboo ways. By depicting the dark and macabre, as well as paranormal and supernatural elements, Gothic fiction pushed the boundaries of conventional taste and broke from the prevailing neoclassical literary aesthetic. Through its subversive themes and tenets, Gothic literature can also reveal insights into the society in which its authors lived.

One of the ways Gothic fiction is subversive is in how it treats religion and spirituality. Horace Walpole's The Castle of Otranto (1764), considered the first Gothic novel, includes supernatural and fantasy elements like prophecy dreams, mysterious deaths, and a haunted castle. Such inclusion of the fantastical challenged the rationalism that dominated the Enlightenment era. Ann Radcliffe's The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794) also portrays Catholicism and its rituals, like exorcisms, in a sinister light, reflecting anti-Catholic sentiments in Britain at the time.

Sexuality is another theme through which Gothic novels subvert social conventions. The tyrannical male figure who imprisons women against their will, as in Udolpho or The Monk (1796), reveals anxieties about female sexuality and autonomy. The transgressive also appears in the form of incest, as in Matthew Lewisâ€™ The Monk. Such taboo subjects would have been forbidden and distasteful to most readers, indicating the Gothic's desire to push conventional boundaries. 

Social class hierarchies also come under scrutiny in Gothic fiction. The lower social classes, like peasants, are often portrayed as superstitious, ignorant, and barbaric, as in Udolpho and Charles Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer (1820). At the same time, the upper classes are frequently depicted as equally corrupt and immoral. This ambiguous treatment of class suggests a certain distrust in authoritative institutions that were traditionally upheld in other genres.

The Gothic's subversive elements were reflections of the societies that produced them. In an era of profound social change with the French Revolution, Gothic tropes expressed cultural anxieties over instability and chaos. The genre also gave voice to repressed desires in the face of strict social codes of propriety in the 18th century. For women writers like Radcliffe, the Gothic narrative provided an outlet to explore female sexuality, autonomy, and power in a way that would be inappropriate in a realistic novel.

In its rejection of neoclassical order and reason in favor of chaos and emotion, the Gothic genre subverted conventional taste and pushed the boundaries of morality. Through explorations of spirituality, sexuality, and class, Gothic fiction challenged social conventions and taboos. For this reason, the Gothic novel can be seen as subversive, while also offering insight into the societies in which its authors and readers lived. The genre reveals a fascination with the dark and forbidden, as well as anxieties surrounding cultural shifts, that lingered beneath the refined sensibilities of the era.
