Here is a draft 1500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Cultural bias can have a significant influence on child-directed speech and language acquisition. Child-directed speech, also known as "baby talk," refers to the way adults modify their speech when talking to young children by using simpler vocabulary, higher pitch, shorter sentences, exaggerated expressions, and slower speech. This simplified manner of speaking is thought to help children learn language more easily by making speech more accessible and engaging. 

However, the way adults engage in child-directed speech is culturally dependent. Some cultures emphasize speech directed at young children that is more simplified, while other cultures take an approach that exposes children to more complex, regular adult speech from an early age. For example, studies of English speakers in the US show that they tend to use very simplified speech with young children, using shorter sentences, simpler words, and exaggerated tone. In contrast, Mayan families in Guatemala tend to speak to children the same way they speak to other adults, using complex grammar and vocabulary. Similarly, studies of bilingual families show that the language parents choose to use child-directed speech in depends on cultural attitudes. Immigrant families in the US are more likely to use English for child-directed speech, while valuing the home language, reflecting a desire for children to learn English and assimilate culturally.  

The type of child-directed speech a child is exposed to has been shown to influence the trajectory of their language development. Simplified speech helps children map sounds to meanings more easily and pick up on the rhythms of speech. However, exposure to more complex, adult-like speech challenges children and exposes them to more sophisticated language, which is also important for development. Studies show children exposed to more complex child-directed speech at an early age tend to develop stronger language skills, with larger vocabularies and more advanced grammar. They are able to have more sophisticated conversations at an earlier age.  

In summary, the cultural values and attitudes of adults significantly impact the type of child-directed speech children experience. The degree of simplification and complexity in child-directed speech shapes how children perceive and process language, which in turn influences the trajectory of language acquisition and development. An early abundance of rich, adult-like conversations challenges children and provides a strong foundation for lifelong language and literacy skills. Recognizing how cultural biases can influence child-directed speech is important for supporting healthy development in all children.
