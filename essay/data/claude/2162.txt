Here is a 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

The ancient Greeks had a strong sense of ethnic identity that shaped many aspects of their society and influenced their interactions with non-Greeks. At the core of Greek identity was a shared language, religion, and culture. To be Greek meant to speak the Greek language, worship the Greek gods, and participate in cultural practices like athletic competitions, festivals, and philosophy.  

This common identity bound the many independent city-states of Greece together, despite their political differences and rivalries. The Greeks viewed themselves as distinct from and superior to non-Greek "barbarians." The word "barbarian" itself comes from the Greek word for foreigner, rooted in the idea that foreigners spoke languages that sounded like "bar-bar" to Greek ears. The Greeks looked down upon those outside their culture as uncivilized and inferior.

The Greek identity and distinction from barbarians strongly influenced Greek politics and citizenship. Only those of Greek descent were allowed to participate in the political process. Metics, foreigners residing in Greece, had limited legal rights and were barred from citizenship. Slaves and barbarians had almost no rights at all. Citizenship was thus tied to Greek ethnicity, not just residence in a city-state. 

The Greek disdain for barbarians also shaped their military and territorial expansion. When Greek armies conquered neighboring lands, they forcibly assimilated foreign populations by imposing their language, religion, and customs. Those unwilling or unable to assimilate faced harsh consequences, even enslavement. The Greeks thus viewed their culture as superior and sought to spread it, by force if necessary.

Not all interactions with barbarians were hostile, however. The Greeks traded goods and knowledge with Egyptians, Persians, and other neighbors. They admired aspects of other cultures, incorporating foreign architectural, artistic, and scientific concepts into their own society. But even when interacting peacefully, the Greeks maintained a sense of superiority over barbarians.

In conclusion, Greek identity revolved around a shared language, religion, and culture which distinguished them from surrounding barbarians. This distinction shaped citizenship, politics, military expansion, and interactions with foreign groups. The Greeks valued their own culture above all others and viewed the spread of Greek customs as a civilizing force. Their strong sense of ethnic identity bound the Greeks together but also set them apart in the ancient world.
