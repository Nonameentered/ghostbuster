The poems "The Waste Land" by T. S. Eliot and "God's Grandeur" by Gerard Manley Hopkins both depict cities as decaying and decrepit, using stylistic devices such as metaphor, alliteration, and repetition to convey this theme. However, while Eliot portrays the city as a dark, godless place representing the decline of Western civilization and spirituality, Hopkins suggests that God's presence can still be found beneath the grime of industrialized society. 

Eliot's "The Burial of the Dead" presents London as a bleak, polluted place using imagery and metaphors, describing its "dead trees" and "dull roots throbbed, like tumors, to hideous blood making mortar." The inhabitants of the city are apathetic and cut off from cultural history, as evidenced by the repetition of "no one had a heart to listen to [Doms] tale" and "drowning men drowned from" lack of spiritual sustenance. Meanwhile, Hopkins in "God's Grandeur" also acknowledges England as a "soiled" place with its "trade-polluted air" and "all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil." However, unlike Eliot, Hopkins finds hope in the city through metaphor, describing its grime as merely a "foil" accentuating the enduring beauty of God: "the Holy Ghost over the bent / World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings." The repetition of "blue-bleak embers" and "ah! bright wings" highlights this contrast between humanity's pollution and God's grandeur. 

In conclusion, while Eliot and Hopkins both adopt a bleak view of the city in their poems, their perspectives differ significantly. Eliot sees the city as representative of the fall of civilization from a formerly enlightened state, using dark imagery and allusion to convey themes of death, apathy, and the loss of spiritual nourishment. Hopkins, on the other hand, uses contrasting metaphors and repetition to suggest that divine beauty and inspiration can still be found even in the dirt and dreariness of the industrialized world. Despite their bleak depiction of cities, Hopkins ultimately expresses a message of hope that is absent from Eliot's nihilistic "The Waste Land."
