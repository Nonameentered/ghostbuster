The post-Civil War period in America, often called the Gilded Age, was marked by rapid industrialization and economic growth in the country. Society saw the emergence of wealthy "robber barons" and an expanding middle class. However, traditional American values of individualism and upward social mobility came under scrutiny during this time. Many works of American literature in the late 19th century interrogated these values and portrayed their limits and downsides. 

One key example is Frank Norris's 1899 novel McTeague. The novel explores the themes of greed, materialism, and the corrupting influence of moneyâ€”all of which call into question the optimism around individual success and social mobility in America. The protagonist, McTeague, begins as a humble dentist serving a working-class San Francisco neighborhood. However, his ambitions are ignited when he wins money in a lottery. The desire for wealth consumes him, leading him to neglect his patients, mistreat his friends, and eventually turn to a life of crime. McTeague's story is a disturbing cautionary tale about the dark side of chasing individual gain without consideration of ethics or community. 

A central message in Norris's work is that greed and extreme materialism pose a threat to human relationships and morality. Early in the story, McTeague lives a simple life as a dentist and maintains genuine friendships and affection for others in his neighborhood. However, after he wins the lottery, his obsession with accumulating money causes him to forsake all else. He becomes distrustful and suspicious even of his close friend Marcus, eventually killing him in a rage. McTeague's longing for gold also leads him to neglect and eventually abandon his wife Trina, who is left helpless and dies in poverty. Through these tragic plot developments, Norris suggests that material gain pursued for its own sake can undermine the values of love, friendship, and community that truly make for a good and moral life.

The conclusion of McTeague also challenges the idea of upward mobility and success attributed to individual hard work. Although McTeague starts from a modest background and builds a dental practice through diligence and training, his eventual downfall is brought about not by any fault of his own but rather by chance and unfortunate events outside of his control. His lottery winnings give him a taste of wealth and spur desires that lead to his ruin. The ending, in which McTeague is handcuffed to the dead body of Marcus in Death Valley, is a cruel ironic twist that highlights the ultimate futility of his striving and the precariousness of success and status in a harsh world. 

In conclusion, Frank Norris's McTeague delivers a sobering critique of the American ideals of individualism, material gain, and upward mobility that were prevalent during the Gilded Age. Through the tragedy of McTeague, Norris suggests that greed, money obsession, and extreme materialism can easily corrupt human values and relationships. The novel also highlights the arbitrary and precarious nature of success, even for those who start with nothing and work to improve their station in life. Overall, McTeague is a dark commentary on the limits and perils of some long-cherished American dreams.
