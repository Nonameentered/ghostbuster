Molecular disease arises from changes or mutations in an individual's DNA sequence that disrupt the normal functioning of cells and tissues in the body. There are five main types of molecular disease: single nucleotide polymorphisms, small insertions and deletions, chromosomal rearrangements, changes in chromosome number, and epigenetic changes. Understanding the molecular basis of disease has allowed researchers to develop new treatments targeted at the specific genetic abnormalities, though more research is still needed to fully understand and treat many conditions.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, are point mutations that involve the substitution of a single nucleotide base in the DNA sequence. For example, sickle cell disease results from a single SNP in the hemoglobin gene that causes the amino acid valine to be incorporated into the hemoglobin protein instead of glutamic acid. This single amino acid change alters the structure and function of hemoglobin, leading to the disease symptoms. Other examples of diseases caused by point mutations include cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease, and Huntington's disease. 

Small insertions or deletions of DNA bases, known as indels, can also lead to molecular disease. Indels that cause a frameshift by shifting the three-nucleotide reading frame of codons can disrupt the amino acid sequence of a protein and render it nonfunctional. An example is Duchenne muscular dystrophy, caused by a deletion in the dystrophin gene that results in a premature stop codon and loss of the dystrophin protein. In contrast, in-frame indels may preserve the reading frame but insert or delete amino acids in the protein sequence, potentially altering its structure and function.

Chromosomal rearrangements involve large-scale changes in chromosome structure. Deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations of chromosome segments have been implicated in various disorders. For example, Jacobsen syndrome is caused by a terminal deletion on chromosome 11, while various forms of leukemia have been linked to translocations between chromosomes 8 and 21. Changes in chromosome number, referred to as aneuploidy, can also contribute to disease. Down syndrome is the most common example, resulting from trisomy of chromosome 21.

Epigenetic changes involve alterations to DNA packaging and regulation rather than the DNA sequence itself. Chemical modifications to DNA and associated proteins can influence gene expression. Imprinting disorders like Angelman syndrome and Prader-Willi syndrome are caused by epigenetic changes involving parent-specific gene expression. Epigenetic changes have also been linked to various types of cancer, highlighting the importance of proper DNA regulation and expression.

While the molecular basis of many diseases is now understood, continued research is needed to fully determine the genetic causes and mechanisms underlying other disorders. A more complete understanding of molecular disease will allow for earlier diagnosis, improved screening and genetic counseling, and the development of targeted therapies to slow or stop disease progression. Overall, mutational events that disrupt the normal structure and function of DNA, chromosomes, and regulatory elements in the genome give rise to the molecular basis of disease.
