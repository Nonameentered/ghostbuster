Here is a 2250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Spartan women differed greatly from their Greek counterparts in many aspects of their lives, including their lifestyles, personalities, and relationships. Spartan women were known for their strength, courage, and relative independence compared to other Greek women. This was largely due to the unique Spartan education system that trained women to be physically fit and capable of handling domestic affairs in the absence of men during wartime.  

Spartan women led active lifestyles and participated in athletic competitions and training. They were encouraged to exercise and build strength from an early age. Physical fitness was considered a virtue for Spartan women, unlike in the rest of Greece where women were discouraged from intense physical activity. Spartan women competed in athletic competitions, including races and wrestling, and they performed gymnastics exercises naked like men. This was shocking to non-Spartans and contributed to the 'Spartan mirage' - the idea that Spartan women were promiscuous and immoral. However, their active lifestyles simply reflected the Spartan value of physical strength and endurance for all citizens.

Spartan women developed strong, outspoken personalities that contrasted with the seclusion and submissiveness expected of other Greek women. They were given more freedom of movement and speech, and were educated and literate. Spartan women could own and inherit property, unlike other Greek women who were legally and economically dependent on male guardians. Spartan women were famous for speaking their minds and reprimanding Spartan men if needed. The outspokenness and confidence of Spartan women surprised non-Spartans who expected women to be quiet and meek. However, Spartan women's personalities simply reflected the belief that all Spartans, regardless of sex, should embody Spartan virtues like courage, discipline and outspokenness.

Relationships between Spartan women and men were also unusually egalitarian for the Greek world. Spartan girls and boys were educated together and developed close platonic relationships from a young age. Spartan women married later than other Greeks, around 18-20 years old, and they continued to value their friendships with other women. Husbands and wives did not live together full-time until their 30s, as men lived in military barracks and women stayed with their families. This promoted women's independence and close friendships with other women. Spartan women were also free to remarry, unlike Athenian women who were legally and socially restricted to one marriage. The relationships between Spartan women and men, like other aspects of Spartan culture, reflected an overall egalitarian ethos that was remarkable for the Greek world.

In conclusion, Spartan women enjoyed much greater freedom, equality and independence than their counterparts throughout Greece. They led active lifestyles, developed strong personalities, and shared egalitarian relationships with Spartan men. Non-Spartans often viewed Spartan women's privileges with suspicion due to their own prejudices, but Sparta's unique philosophical system promoted strength, courage, and self-discipline as virtues for all citizens regardless of sex or status. Spartan women were essential to Sparta's success, raising strong sons and managing households while men were at war. Their strength and bravery was a source of pride for Sparta. The freedom of Spartan women was truly remarkable in the context of Ancient Greece.
