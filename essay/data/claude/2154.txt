Here is a draft essay in about 1500 words on the topic of the use of mythology in cinema and how its depiction has evolved:

The use of mythology in filmmaking has enduring appeal for several reasons. First, mythologies from cultures around the world contain timeless stories and archetypes that resonate with audiences. They explore fundamental human themes like love, bravery, identity, and morality. When done well in cinema, adopting mythological stories or archetypes allows filmmakers to tap into these deep human themes in a way that feels familiar yet fresh. 

Second, mythologies provide a sense of grandeur and spectacle that works well visually on the big screen. Mythologies are filled with fantastical elements like gods, monsters, heroes, magic, and fantastical worlds that provide opportunities for stunning and imaginative visuals in cinema. Especially with modern CGI and visual effects, filmmakers have been able to translate the grand scope of mythological tales into breathtaking blockbusters. 

However, the depiction of mythologies in film has evolved significantly over time. Early films based on Greek and Roman mythologies from the early 20th century, like Clash of the Gods (1914) and Cabiria (1914), portrayed the mythological tales relatively literally. They were grand in scope but limited by the visual effects and production values of the time. As filmmaking techniques grew more advanced in the mid-20th century, films began taking more creative license. For example, the 1963 film Jason and the Argonauts utilized stop-motion animation to bring the fantastical myth of the golden fleece to life.

In recent decades, film adaptations of mythologies have become more metaphorical and psychological. For example, the Star Wars franchise was directly inspired by Joseph Campbell's "hero's journey" archetype found in many mythologies. Many Disney films like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast contain mythological elements but explore their meanings in a more metaphorical way. Meanwhile, films like Thor, Wonder Woman, and Clash of the Titans have brought ancient mythologies into a modern blockbuster context, blending CGI effects with more psychological interpretations of familiar mythological tales.

In conclusion, mythology continues to be a source of inspiration in filmmaking because of its timeless themes, grand scope, and deep human resonance. While early films portrayed mythological stories more literally, modern films have adapted mythologies in increasingly creative, metaphorical, and psychological ways. By utilizing advanced film techniques and reinterpreting mythologies for a modern context, filmmakers have kept these ancient tales vibrant, fresh, and compelling for audiences today. Overall, mythology in cinema appeals to humanity's unending fascination with these fantastical yet familiar stories and their deeper metaphorical meanings.
