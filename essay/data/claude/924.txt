Here is a 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

There are several factors that contribute to the stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS and significantly impact those living with the disease. HIV/AIDS is associated with behaviors that some consider immoral or taboo, such as intravenous drug use and unprotected sex. There are also misconceptions about how the disease is transmitted that lead to unwarranted fear and judgment of those with HIV. This stigma negatively impacts individuals with HIV both psychosocially and in their access to healthcare. Reducing stigma and promoting acceptance are crucial to effectively addressing the HIV epidemic.

One of the primary drivers of HIV stigma is its association with behaviors that some consider immoral, such as unprotected sex, especially unprotected homosexual sex, and intravenous drug use. When the HIV epidemic first emerged in the 1980s, it was labeled as a “gay disease,” which contributed greatly to its stigmatization. Today, while HIV affects people of all genders and orientations, this perception still lingers, feeding into moral judgments of how people contracted the virus. Similarly, addiction and drug use are highly stigmatized, and this compounds the judgment of those who contract HIV through shared needles. Because these behaviors are taboo in society, people with HIV are often viewed as somehow deserving of the disease due to their perceived irresponsibility or deviance. This undeserved blame contributes greatly to feelings of shame and isolation in people living with HIV.
