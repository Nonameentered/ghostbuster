Did the Romans believe their emperor to be a god? The relationship between the Roman emperor and religion was complex, with the level of 'divinity' varying both during an emperor's lifetime and after his death. In many ways, the emperor was treated as a living god, though for most Romans, the emperor was not on par with the major deities of the Roman pantheon.

The state cult, run by the government, portrayed the emperor as divine and spread propaganda to encourage his worship. Upon becoming emperor, an elaborate religious ceremony called the consecratio would proclaim him a god. Temples and priests were dedicated to the imperial cult, and subjects were expected to offer prayers, sacrifices, and libations to the emperor on a regular basis and pay homage during festivals like the Genius of the Emperor on his birthday. Coins featuring the emperor's face and titles like 'son of god' were circulated. This widespread political propaganda reinforced the notion that the emperor was divine.

However, the veneration of the emperor in the state cult was often superficial and mandated. In private, most Romans did not worship the living emperor as a high god in their daily household rituals or prayers. The emperor was more akin to a patron than a truly divine figure like Jupiter. His 'divinity' was contextual - dependent on his successful leadership and military victories. He could lose favor and prestige if he failed to fulfil religious duties or protect the Empire. After death, some emperors could be officially deified by their successors, allowing their cults to grow more prominent and sincere. But deification was not a given - only emperors who were perceived as successful could become full state gods.

The variations in how the emperors were worshipped show the mix of political pragmatism and religious belief present in Roman society. The imperial cult was a powerful way for the state to demand allegiance and compliance, but for most Romans, the emperor was not a god in the same way as traditional deities. In the public sphere, people participated in the cult as part of their civic duty, not because they viewed the living emperor as fully divine. In private, traditional Roman polytheism remained more meaningful to daily life. But for some, particular emperors and their ideologies held a spiritual resonance and devotion that spanned both the public and private spheres of Roman religion. 

In conclusion, while the Roman emperor was officially proclaimed a god and received cult worship, the Romans did not view him as equivalent to the traditional gods of their pantheon, especially during his own lifetime. The level of belief in his divinity varied between individuals and also depended on the deeds and legacy of the particular emperor. For most Romans, the emperor was semi-divine at best, occupying a space between human and immortal. So, while the Romans publicly treated their emperor as divine, the nature and degree of that divinity depended on complex religious and political factors in Roman society.
