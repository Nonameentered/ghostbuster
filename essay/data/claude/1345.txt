Women's movements across the world face the complex challenge of intersecting identities among women that can divide or limit cooperation and collective action.  In Uganda, the women's movement must grapple with differences in ethnicity, class, religion, and other identities to build a broad coalition and effectively fight against the subordination of all Ugandan women. Successful mobilization strategies that transcend these divisions and promote inclusiveness and unity are key to achieving meaningful gains in gender equality.

The women's movement in Uganda emerged in the 1980s during a period of political liberalization, but early groups were dominated by educated, urban women of higher classes. The groups focused narrowly on legal and policy changes, neglecting the concerns of poorer, rural women. For example, laws were passed to reform family law and protect women's property rights, but did little to address the economic dependence and vulnerability of poor women. Gradually, the movement recognized the need to build alliances across groups to advance a common agenda.  

The 1995 United Nations World Conference on Women in Beijing was a pivotal moment, bringing together activists from diverse backgrounds and pushing them to find common ground. Women from different ethnic groups—Baganda, Iteso, Karamojong—connected around shared experiences of discrimination and disadvantage. They formed broader coalitions and networks to coordinate advocacy on issues like women's political participation, access to microfinance, and protection from violence. These alliances were instrumental in successful campaigns for laws on domestic violence, female genital mutilation, and marriage and divorce.

However, divisions persist, and more work is needed to foster inclusiveness. Many rural, poor and less-educated women remain isolated from mainstream women's groups. Successful strategies should focus on "meeting women where they are"—establishing decentralized chapters and outreach programs accessible to all women. Groups can build solidarity by emphasizing women's shared interests across ethnic or class lines and embracing diverse leadership. Finally, advocacy must address the most marginalized women's needs, like economic empowerment, education and healthcare access. Only by empowering the most disadvantaged women can the movement achieve equality for all.

In conclusion, the Ugandan women's movement should pursue inclusiveness through decentralized and diverse organization, shared interest-based organizing, and priority focus on the most marginalized groups. By mobilizing women across ethnic, religious and class differences, the movement can overcome divisions, build a platform to advocate for all women's rights, and make substantial progress toward gender equality in Uganda. Overall, promoting inclusiveness and solidarity is key to empowering women and defeating women's subordination.
