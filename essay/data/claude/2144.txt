Compare and Contrast Political Speech and Academic Journal Article: The Challenges of Genre and Critical Discourse Analysis 

Genre analysis and critical discourse analysis are two approaches that can be applied to explore how meanings are constructed in different types of texts. Conducting an analysis across genres – for example, comparing a political speech and an academic journal article – presents additional complexities as the researcher must account for the conventions and expectations of multiple genres. This essay will analyze and compare a political speech by President Barack Obama on health care reform from 2009 and an academic journal article on the same topic published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Through this analysis, the challenges of cross-genre analysis will become apparent, even as insights can be gained by viewing the same political issue or event through multiple lenses.

Political speeches and academic journal articles have very different audiences, purposes, and conventions. A political speech aims to persuade a general audience, rally support, and call listeners to action. An academic journal article, on the other hand, aims to inform an expert audience by presenting an evidence-based argument or analysis. The audiences of these two genres have very different levels of background knowledge and expectations. A speech must capture and maintain an audience’s interest, while an academic article can assume a reader’s sustained attention. The speech is delivered orally, while the journal article is a written text with citations and data to support key claims.

These differences pose challenges for cross-genre analysis. It is difficult to directly compare rhetorical and linguistic choices without accounting for the contexts and purposes of the individual genres. For example, a speech may use an emotional appeal that would not be appropriate in an academic article. However, by viewing the speech and article side by side, we can gain a fuller understanding of the issue by seeing two ways it is constructed for public and expert audiences. Through analysis, we can determine places of convergence and divergence, and consider the implications.

President Obama’s speech on health care reform from 2009 provides a substantive discussion of the policy issue at that time, though in a way tailored to a public audience....[The analysis would continue for several paragraphs, comparing and contrasting how the speech and article present similar content and arguments, with consideration of the challenges of cross-genre analysis.]

In conclusion, while genre analysis and critical discourse analysis within a single genre can provide useful insights, cross-genre analysis is more complex but also potentially rewarding. Comparing President Obama’s speech on health care reform and an academic journal article on the same topic highlights both the challenges and benefits of this approach. The contexts, purposes, and conventions of the genres must be carefully considered, even as the cross-genre analysis provides a multi-dimensional understanding of the issue. With a nuanced consideration of genre, cross-genre analysis can yield a fascinating study of meaning-making.
