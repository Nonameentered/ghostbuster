There are several factors that affect the laying and reproduction of domesticated birds. These factors include the availability and quality of food, availability of nesting spaces, temperature and light exposure, hormonal changes, breeding strategies, and human interventions like selective breeding and the use of artificial lighting and temperature control. These factors interact in complex ways to regulate broodiness and egg production in domesticated birds.

One of the most important factors influencing egg laying in birds is the availability and quality of food. Birds require a variety of nutrients, especially protein and calcium, to be able to produce eggs. Insufficient food or a diet lacking in certain nutrients will decrease egg production. For egg-laying birds like chickens raised for egg production, providing a balanced layer feed with adequate protein and calcium is critical to maintaining a steady rate of egg laying.

The availability of nesting spaces and nesting materials is also important for triggering egg laying in birds. Birds will generally not lay eggs if they do not have an available nesting spot. In addition, the amount of available nesting space can determine clutch size, with more nesting space allowing for larger clutches. For domesticated birds, providing nesting boxes and an area where the birds can gather nesting materials will stimulate egg laying. 

Temperature and exposure to light also play a significant role in egg laying for birds. Increasing temperatures and longer day lengths in the spring stimulate hormonal changes in birds that cue breeding behavior and egg laying. Many domesticated birds kept for egg laying, like chickens, ducks, and geese, are kept in environments with controlled lighting schedules to maximize egg production. Extending day length using artificial light is a common technique to encourage non-seasonal egg laying.

Hormonal changes, especially increasing levels of estrogen and progesterone, directly trigger egg laying in female birds. These hormones stimulate the development and release of eggs from the ovary. Several environmental and social factors regulate these hormonal changes and breeding physiology in birds. For domesticated birds, breeding strategies and mate selection are typically controlled by humans for the purpose of maximizing egg fertility and productivity.  

Selective breeding over many generations has also produced breeds of chickens, ducks, geese, and other domesticated egg-laying birds that have a high capacity for egg production. Selective breeding, especially when combined with optimized diets and lighting conditions, has enabled some chicken breeds to lay over 300 eggs per year, compared to less than 30 for their wild counterparts.

In summary, food availability, nesting spaces, temperature, light exposure, hormones, breeding strategies, and selective breeding are the key factors that regulate egg laying in domesticated birds. Carefully optimizing these factors through habitat control, diet, mating selections, lighting schedules, and choosing productive breeds allows for precise control over broodiness and high rates of egg production in domesticated egg-laying birds. With human intervention, these birds have been transformed into highly efficient egg producing machines.
