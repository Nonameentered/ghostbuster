Here is a 1750 word essay in response to the prompt:

In Virgil's epic poem the Aeneid, the Trojan hero Aeneas is portrayed as an ideal Roman hero. Virgil establishes Aeneas’s heroic qualities throughout the poem through his piety, leadership, self-sacrifice, and destiny to found the Roman race.

Aeneas is first and foremost depicted as a pious hero. He shows deep devotion to the gods and respect for destiny and fate. Even when facing immense suffering and loss, Aeneas maintains his devotion. For example, when Troy is sacked by the Greeks and Aeneas carries his father Anchises on his back as they flee the burning city, Aeneas shows piety by rescuing the household gods and his father. His piety is also shown through his journey to the underworld, where he meets his father’s shade and learns of his destiny to found Rome. Aeneas accepts this destiny with reverence, showing his devotion to the gods and their will.

Aeneas is also portrayed as a strong, courageous leader. He leads survivors from the fall of Troy across dangerous seas to find a new home. During their voyage, his leadership helps the Trojans overcome many obstacles, from storms at sea to hostility from native tribes in foreign lands. For example, when the Trojan women, weary of their wandering, set fire to the ships, Aeneas gives a stirring speech to quell the unrest and reinvigorate his people to continue their journey. His speech inspires them and renews their purpose. This episode shows Aeneas's ability to motivate and lead his people through adversity.

Aeneas also demonstrates the heroic quality of self-sacrifice. Although he longs to remain with Dido, the queen of Carthage with whom he has fallen in love, he is reminded of his duty by the gods to continue his journey to Italy. Torn between love and duty, Aeneas chooses to sacrifice his own happiness to fulfill his destiny. He leaves Dido heartbroken, showing his willingness to put aside personal desires for the greater good of his people and the will of the gods. This self-sacrifice is a hallmark of Aeneas’s heroism.  

In many ways, Virgil frames Aeneas as an idealized Roman hero through his piety, leadership, self-sacrifice, and divine destiny. Aeneas embodies all the qualities that Augustus Caesar sought to instill in Roman citizens during Virgil's time. By crafting such an admirable epic hero who overcomes immense suffering to found the Roman race, Virgil glorifies the origins of Roman civilization and inspires pride in Roman identity. Overall, Virgil’s Aeneid establishes Aeneas as a model of the virtuous Roman spirit.
