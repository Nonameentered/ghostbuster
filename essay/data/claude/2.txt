The rise of medicine as a profession in the 19th century had significant implications for women, both in terms of gender and class. As medicine became more scientific and rigorous, it was dominated by men, squeezing women out of many traditional medical roles. At the same time, the social separation of male doctors and female patients, especially of the middle and upper classes, put women in a subordinate position in the doctor-patient relationship and medical knowledge itself.

Traditionally, women had served as healers and caretakers, roles that involved medical knowledge and skills. Midwives, in particular, played an important role in childbirth and womenâ€™s health. As medicine became professionalized, however, male physicians sought to marginalize female healers and establish their authority over medical practice. Laws were passed banning midwives from assisting in childbirth or requiring them to be licensed by all-male medical boards. The rise of "scientific medicine" was used to portray female healers as uneducated and their knowledge as superstitious. This process systematically excluded women from the medical profession and the production of medical knowledge.

The patient role also took on a gendered character with the rise of the modern medical profession. Especially for middle- and upper-class women, interactions with physicians were fraught encounters across gender lines. Doctors were typically upper-class men, while female patients were usually of a similar or lower social standing. Women were seen as the "weaker sex" and their bodies and minds were believed fundamentally different. This contributed to a paternalistic view of women's health where they were treated like children. Women's concerns and voices were marginalized.

In some ways, the professionalization of medicine was disempowering and marginalizing for women. However, it also brought some benefits, such as improved standards of care, scientific knowledge, and innovative treatments. On balance, though, the rise of  medicine as a male-dominated profession in the 19th century reflected and reinforced the broader gender inequalities of the era. Women lost authority and autonomy, while being subject to a system that was inherently androcentric. The implications were complex but largely resulted in the systematic subordination of women in medicine that still reverberate to today.
