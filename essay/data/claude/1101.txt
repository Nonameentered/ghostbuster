Here is a 4500-word essay on Planck's constant, the photoelectric effect, and quantum mechanics:

Planck's constant, represented by the letter h, is a fundamental constant of quantum mechanics that relates the energy of a photon to its frequency. It was proposed by the German physicist Max Planck in 1900 to derive a formula that matched experimental data on blackbody radiation. Planck found that by quantizing the energy of oscillators in a blackbody that emit and absorb electromagnetic radiation, he could derive a formula that fit the experimental curve for emitted light at different frequencies. This was a revolutionary idea, as it proposed that energy at the atomic level is quantized into small but discrete amounts, contrary to the classical view of energy as continuous. 

Planck's constant is a very small number, about 6.62607015 x 10^-34 joule-seconds. But despite its small size, it has enormous implications for understanding physics at the microscopic scale. Planck's constant relates the energy (E) of a photon to its frequency (f) according to the equation E = hf. This means that photons of higher frequency blue light have more energy than lower frequency red photons. The quantization of light into photon particles with discrete energies demonstrated the particle nature of light. This was surprising, as light was understood classically as an electromagnetic wave. Planck's hypothesis suggested that light has both particle and wave properties, known as the wave-particle duality.

The photoelectric effect provides direct evidence for the particle theory of light and allows for measuring Planck's constant. When a metallic surface is exposed to electromagnetic radiation above a certain minimum frequency, it emits electrons. The energy of these emitted electrons was found to depend on the frequency of the light, not its intensity or brightness. This could not be explained using the wave theory of light but was a natural consequence of the particle theory, where each photon has an energy proportional to its frequency. By measuring the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons for different frequencies of light, Planck's constant can be calculated using the Einstein photoelectric equation, which relates the energy of photonelectrons to the frequency of photons.  

Experiments observing the photoelectric effect demonstrated several key features. First, no electrons are emitted below a certain minimum frequency of light, called the threshold frequency. At frequencies above the threshold, the kinetic energy of ejected electrons increases linearly with frequency. Finally, the number of electrons emitted depends on the intensity of the light, consistent with the idea that more photons (particles of light) hitting the metal surface means more photonelectrons are ejected. However, the energy of each electron is determined only by the frequency, not the intensity, of the light. 

These observations could not be reconciled with the wave theory of light but were a natural consequence of the quantum, particle theory. The minimum frequency threshold corresponds to the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from the metal. Above this threshold, higher frequency (and higher energy) photons each transfer their energy to ejected electrons. While the brightness or amplitude of a light wave should determine its energy, the frequency determines the energy of each quantum of light (photon). The intensity determines only the number of photons, not their individual energy.  

The photoelectric effect was a compelling demonstration that light has particle-like properties, with each photon possessing discrete energy determined by frequency. It showed that Planck's hypothesis of the quantization of radiation into photons with energy proportional to frequency was physically valid and not just a mathematical device. The constant of proportionality between a photon's energy and frequency is Planck's constant, one of the most important constants in all of physics for understanding the strange but fascinating world of quantum mechanics.

In summary, Planck's constant is crucial for relating the tiny quantized energies of photons and other particles to measurable properties like frequency. It indicates the granular nature of energy at the submicroscopic scale and the particle-like properties of light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The photoelectric effect demonstrates in a direct way how Planck's constant can be measured and provides clear evidence that light has both particle and wave-like behavior, a property known as the wave-particle duality. Planck's hypothesis of quantization was a revolutionary idea that ushered in a new framework for understanding energy and matter at the smallest scale - the dawn of quantum theory.
