The cultural web is a framework developed by Gerry Johnson and Kevan Scholes that helps understand the layers of culture within an organization and how those layers influence cultural change. The cultural web consists of six interrelated elements: stories, symbols, rituals and routines, control systems, organizational structures, and power structures. These elements shape the "paradigms" or taken-for-granted assumptions that guide behavior. Understanding these elements of an organization's culture and how they interact is key to understanding organizational culture and driving strategic change.  

Marks and Spencer (M&S) is an example of a company that has undergone significant strategic changes under different CEOs by leveraging the elements of the cultural web. In the 1990s and early 2000s, M&S struggled with a stagnant culture that did not match changing customer tastes and the rise of fast fashion competitors. New CEO Stuart Rose took over in 2004 and initiated a revival plan to turn the company around. 

Rose made major changes to the organizational and power structures by replacing many senior managers and simplifying reporting lines. He changed control systems by setting new performance targets linked to incentives. He also tapped into the power of stories and symbols. He articulated a new vision for the company that was rooted in its heritage to inspire pride in staff, and he closed poorly performing stores - a symbolic break with the past. These collective changes in the cultural web reshaped the company's culture and paradigm, driving improved performance.

CEO Marc Bolland built on these foundations but faced new challenges as online shopping grew. He made further changes to upgrade M&S's outdated infrastructure and technology systems. He restructured the organization to create dedicated teams focused on online retail. He also reworked routines and rituals around product design and development to enable faster fashion cycles. However, he was less effective at managing the soft elements of the cultural web. Key parts of the organization resisted changes in culture and paradigm, leading to uneven strategic execution. 

Current CEO Steve Rowe, an M&S veteran, has sought to reunify the culture and reclaim M&S's heritage. He launched a campaign emphasizing "Spend it Well" to deepen the company's emotional connection with customers. He also restructured to create a more cohesive organization between stores and online operations. Rowe's balancing of the hard and soft levers in the cultural web, with an emphasis on stories and symbols, has helped build momentum for strategic change.  

In conclusion, the cultural web provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing organizational culture and levers for driving strategic change. Managing and evolving an organization's cultural web by tapping into multiple elements, hard and soft, is key to reshaping cultural paradigms in a sustainable way. The case of Marks and Spencer shows how different leaders can drive revival and renewal by leveraging the power of organizational culture. Overall, organizational culture is a critical resource that shapes a company's ability to adapt to change.
