ATP synthase is a molecular machine that produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main energy carrier in cells, by using the proton gradient across biological membranes. ATP synthase has two main components: 1) F0 is  embedded in the membrane and acts as a proton channel, and 2) F1 protrudes from the membrane and acts as the catalytic site of ATP synthesis. The flow of protons through F0 provides the energy to drive the rotary motor in F1, which in turn powers ATP synthesis. 

The structure of ATP synthase was first deduced from electron microscopy studies in the 1960s, showing a stalked particle protruding from membranes. Higher resolution images from X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy then revealed the detailed structures of F1 and F0, composed of multiple subunits. The F1 component has a hexameric ring structure with three α/β dimers. The central stalk connects F1 to F0, which has a ring of 10 to 15 c subunits that form the proton channel. Protons flow down their electrochemical gradient from the intermembrane space through F0, driving the c ring to rotate. This rotation is transmitted to the central stalk, which causes conformational changes in the F1 that bind ADP and phosphate, leading to the synthesis of ATP.

Key experiments support the coupling of proton flow and ATP synthesis. Uncouplers like dinitrophenol can dissipate the proton gradient and inhibit ATP synthesis.  Membrane vesicles with only F0 and the stalk still synthesize ATP when a pH gradient is created across the membrane. Fluorescent dyes attached to F1 and the c ring have shown that the two components counter-rotate during ATP synthesis at the same rate as proton flow. Recent high-resolution structures of the entire ATP synthase complex have confirmed how the relative rotation of F1 and F0 subunits drives sequential changes in F1 that produce ATP.

Some questions remain regarding the precise details of the proton pathway through F0 and the conformational changes in F1. However, it is clear that the essence of ATP synthase operation is  a rotary mechanism driven by proton transfer down an electrochemical gradient to  produce ATP from ADP and phosphate through conformational coupling. This elegant molecular machine taps into the most fundamental biological energy source, ion gradients, to produce the key currency of energy in the cell. ATP synthase is a prime example of biological nanotechnology and remains an area of active research.
