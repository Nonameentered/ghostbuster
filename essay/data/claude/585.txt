Here is a draft 2000-word essay in response to the prompt:

The implementation of change at Cox's Container Company (C.C.C.) faces several significant issues. Primarily, these issues stem from problems with the organization's structure, leadership, teams, and power dynamics. The change strategy employed also falls short of Kotter's eight steps to transforming an organization, and the Belbin model provides additional insight into the challenges involved.

First, C.C.C.'s structure is siloed and hierarchical, impeding communication and collaboration between executives and lower-level employees. This distance between executives and lower-level staff limits mechanisms for input and feedback. Executive direction for the change is perceived as top-down and lacking in employee engagement or buy-in. Increased communication between executives and lower-level staff could help foster a sense of joint ownership over the change process. Second, C.C.C.'s leadership is overly directive and hesitant to relinquish control. The senior leadership team drives the vision for change and dictates how it will be achieved. This leadership style results in lack of staff empowerment or engagement in problem-solving. Executives could empower middle managers and lower-level staff by involving them in shaping the change vision and determining how to implement it. 

Third, C.C.C. lacks effective cross-functional teams to support the change effort. Most work is done within siloed departments, limiting the spread of new ideas or best practices across the organization. Forming cross-functional teams focused specifically on the change could help break down established silos and spur more innovative thinking. These teams need autonomy and decision-making power to be impactful. 

Finally, power at C.C.C. is concentrated at the top rather than shared across the organization. This imbalance inhibits lower-level staff from speaking up or pushing back against executive directives. For change to be successful, power needs to be distributed to give lower-level employees more influence and authority. This could involve reconfiguring reporting relationships or reconceiving job roles to provide more decision-making control and responsibilities.

In summary, the primary issues undermining change at C.C.C. relate to its organizational structure, leadership approach, team dynamics, and unequal distribution of power. The change strategy employed does not fully realize Kotter's steps, especially in establishing a sense of urgency, building a guiding coalition, empowering broad-based action, and anchoring new approaches in the culture. Applying Belbin's analysis, C.C.C. exhibits an authoritarian culture and personality whereby leadership is directive and power remains concentrated at the top. To overcome these substantial challenges, C.C.C. must work to distribute power, foster engagement at all levels, form cross-functional teams, and develop a more participative leadership approach. By making these critical transformations, C.C.C. can implement change that is both impactful and sustainable.
