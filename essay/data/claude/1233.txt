Here is a 1750 word essay in response to the prompt:

The "LiquiSaver" system is an innovative automated liquor control and dispensing system developed by SCS Ltd, a start-up technology company based in London, UK. The system is beneficial for establishments like bars, pubs, and nightclubs that have a large number of staff serving alcoholic drinks to customers. 

The "LiquiSaver" system works by storing various types of alcoholic drinks in large dispensers that are connected to a centralized software system. Each dispenser has an integrated scale that monitors the level of liquid in the container in real-time. The software system keeps track of how much of each drink is dispensed and totals the volumes. It also notes the types of drinks and can automatically place orders with suppliers when stocks are running low based on programmed reorder points.

The system provides three key benefits to establishments. Firstly, it minimizes product loss from waste, spills, or overpouring of drinks. The precision pouring technology fills each glass with the exact amount of liquid required for each drink. This can significantly reduce losses from overpouring which is common with manual pouring. 

Secondly, the system provides live data on drink volumes, allowing optimized stock management and reduced likelihood of running out of popular drink options. The software alerts management or staff when drink levels reach reorder points so new stock can be ordered and delivered before existing stocks empty. This data also allows analysis of popular drinks to optimize product offerings. 

Thirdly, the system reduces labor costs as it automates the pouring function. One staff member can operate multiple dispensing machines simultaneously, allowing fewer staff to serve more customers. The easy-to-use interface requires minimal training, reducing onboarding costs for new staff.

SCS Ltd was founded two years ago by a team of engineers and software developers with experience in automation technologies and programming. They spent 18 months developing a prototype of the "LiquiSaver" system, testing it in a London bar to validate the benefits and gain customer feedback. With positive results, they obtained venture capital funding six months ago to commercialize the product.

The company's plans are to deploy the "LiquiSaver" system into more establishments in London and surrounding areas over the next 12 months. They will then seek international expansion starting in Western Europe and North America. The goal is to have 2,000 dispensers in operation within 24 months generating over Â£5 million in annual revenue.
  
There are a few risks faced by SCS Ltd that could disrupt their planned growth. The first is technical faults or failures of the dispensers that could slow down operations and require servicing. They aim to mitigate this by building in diagnostics and over-the-air update capabilities into the system as well as stocking spare parts for rapid repairs. 

The second risk is a lack of customer adoption, especially as the system requires an upfront capital investment. The company is addressing this through a leasing model with a low upfront cost and sharing some of the cost savings generated from the system. They are also targeting large chains first where efficiencies can achieve scale. 

Overall, SCS Ltd has developed an innovative system in "LiquiSaver" that can benefit many establishments reliant on manual drink pouring and dispensing. With their leasing model and focus on large chains first, they stand to overcome the risks around customer adoption and technical issues, allowing successful expansion and scale over the next 24 months and beyond. Constant innovation will also keep their system on the cutting edge, maintaining appeal to customers.
