Corporate manslaughter laws aim to hold corporations criminally liable for workplace deaths and injuries due to negligence. However, attributing criminal fault to corporations has been a complex issue, given that corporations are abstract entities that act through individuals. There has been much debate on how to determine corporate criminal liability and whether individuals within the corporation, such as directors and officers, should also face prosecution. 

In the UK, the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 made it possible to prosecute corporations for manslaughter. Under the Act, a corporation can be found guilty of manslaughter if a gross failure in its management or organization causes a person's death and amounts to a breach of a relevant duty of care. The Act focuses on failings at the level of senior management. However, prosecuting corporations has proven difficult. Since the law came into effect, there have only been a small number of successful prosecutions.

One key issue is that it can be hard to identify a single individual responsible for failures within a corporation. Corporations typically have complex structures with delegated responsibilities, making it difficult to pinpoint culpability. The 'identification doctrine' requires prosecutors to find a 'directing mind and will' of the corporation, like a director or senior manager, who was responsible for the failure. However, decisions within corporations are often made collectively by multiple individuals at different levels. The narrow focus on senior management may also let middle managers and supervisors escape accountability.

There is an argument that a wider range of individuals, potentially including directors, senior managers, and supervisors, should face prosecution for corporate manslaughter. For a workplace death, multiple individuals are often concurrently responsible through their action or inaction. However, prosecutors are often reluctant to bring charges against individuals, as it can be difficult to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, especially for supervisors and middle managers. An "aggregation" approach has been proposed, which considers the cumulative actions of different individuals that led to the failure, rather than searching for a single "directing mind". This could potentially make more individuals liable, casting a wider net of accountability.
