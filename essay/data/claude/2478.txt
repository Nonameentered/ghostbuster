Here is a 500-word essay in response to the prompt:

Biomass refers to organic matter from plants and animals that can be used as an energy source. It is the fourth largest source of global primary energy, providing about 10% of the world's energy needs. As plants grow, they absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into carbohydrates, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. When biomass is burned for energy, it releases the carbon back into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide. In this way, biomass is considered a renewable resource because the carbon emissions from burning it can be recycled back into new plant growth.  

However, human use of biomass energy at large scales disrupts the natural carbon cycle and contributes to climate change. When natural vegetation is harvested for biofuel production at large volumes, it reduces the amount of carbon that plants can absorb from the atmosphere. The large-scale burning of biomass also releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases at a rate that outpaces the ability of plants to absorb them. Deforestation to produce agricultural biomass also destroys natural habitats and reduces biodiversity. According to some estimates, bioenergy from biomass makes up nearly 60% of renewable energy but accounts for 79% of greenhouse gas emissions from the renewable energy sector.

To use biomass sustainably as an energy source, a few principles should be followed. First, biomass should only be harvested at a rate that allows regrowth and sustainable replenishment. Second, native plants and organic waste materials should be prioritized over large monoculture plantations. Third, biomass should be used for high-value products before being burned for energy. And fourth, biomass energy should be used in efficient co-generation plants that can produce both electricity and heat. Sustainable bioenergy production can provide economic opportunity in rural areas if done properly. Overall, biomass will likely continue to play a role in the global renewable energy mix but must be managed carefully to mitigate environmental damage. By following sustainable practices, biomass energy can positively contribute to a low-carbon future.
