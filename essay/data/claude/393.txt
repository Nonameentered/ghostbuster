The Definition of Literacy Has Changed with New Technologies and Resources 

The definition of literacy has expanded in the 21st century to include a range of media, skills, and competencies. Traditionally, literacy referred to the ability to read and write, but today multimedia technologies, online resources, and digital platforms have reshaped how we consume and create media. This new landscape of literacy includes competencies such as information literacy, media literacy, visual literacy, and digital literacy. Educators need to consider how to develop students' skills and fluency across these new areas of literacy while also maintaining a focus on foundational reading and writing.

Information literacy refers to the ability to find, evaluate, and use information effectively. With a massive volume of information available online, students need strong skills to navigate, analyze, and validate information. They must determine the credibility of sources, identify biases and logical fallacies, and synthesize information from multiple places. Teachers should provide opportunities for students to search for and evaluate information on topics of their choice to build these skills in an authentic way. They should also model how to determine credibility and logical reasoning in different media.

Media literacy encompasses the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, and create media in all its forms. This includes print media, radio, television, advertising, film, and social media. Students need to understand how the media can shape perceptions and beliefs. Teachers should encourage critical analysis of media, having students deconstruct advertisements, news articles, films, and social media posts to understand the messages and techniques being used. Students should also create their own media, like short films, to build literacy in expressing ideas and stories through multimedia.
