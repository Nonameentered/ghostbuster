The major concern of this assignment is to compare different controllers for various dynamic systems and evaluate their performance. The methods used to compare the controllers are modeling the systems and simulating their responses to setpoint changes and disturbances under different controllers. Feedback control systems are vital for dynamic systems as they help regulate the output to stay at the desired setpoint in the presence of disturbances and disturbances. 

Proportional controllers provide a simple control method by producing an output proportional to the error signal. They help reduce the steady-state error but often provide an oscillatory response, especially for higher gains. PID controllers tune all three parameters—proportional, integral, and derivative gains—to improve the transient response and reduce the steady-state error. While they require extensive tuning, they can provide a good overall response for many applications. Modified Ziegler-Nichols or MZN PID tuning provides a tuned set of PID gains to achieve a fast response with stability. It requires modeling the process to determine its parameters before tuning the controller.

Bode's Maximum Available Feedback or MAF design method determines the maximum feedback gain that can be applied while maintaining stability based on the system's open-loop frequency response. It provides a quick way to determine stabilizing feedback gains without extensive modeling or trial-and-error. However, the maximum stable gain may be very conservative, and the resulting closed-loop performance may not be optimal.

The tests on the different systems showed that the proportional controller produced a fast but oscillatory response for a higher gain on the inertia and conical tank systems. The PID controller was able to provide a fast, stable response with minimal overshoot for the conical tank system after tuning. The MZN PID controller worked well for the more complex distillation column system by providing reasonably fast control of disturbances with minimal cycling based on a model of the system dynamics. Finally, the MAF method produced a stable but overly conservative gain for the distillation column that resulted in a slow response to disturbances.

In summary, proportional controllers are simple but often produce oscillatory responses. PID controllers can work well when properly tuned based on the system dynamics. Advanced methods like MZN PID and MAF have the potential to provide good performance but rely on system modeling and gain a more conservative control, respectively. The performance of the various controllers depends significantly on the complexity and dynamics of the system to be controlled. With more advanced simulations and comparisons, a definitive ranking of these methods could be determined for different classes of systems.
