The transition from hunter-gatherer subsistence strategies to farming economies between the Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic periods in Northwest Europe represents a major dietary shift that can be examined through both archaeological material evidence and stable isotope analysis of human skeletal remains. Theories and models of Mesolithic-Neolithic transition propose that the adoption of agriculture led to increased dependence on domesticated plants and animals. Archaeological evidence indicates a shift from predominantly wild resource exploitation to the cultivation of crops and the herding of livestock, suggesting a transition to farming-based diet. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope measurements of human bones and teeth also reveal a change from Mesolithic diets high in wild protein to Neolithic diets more reliant on domesticated plants and terrestrial animals. However, stable isotope methodology has certain limitations and sample biases that require cautious interpretation of dietary changes.

Transition theories suggest that population growth and resource scarcity in the Late Mesolithic drove the adoption of agriculture to produce more food, leading to a fundamental shift from mobile hunter-gatherer lifestyle to sedentary farming life. The Broad Spectrum Revolution model proposes greater exploitation of varied resources, but stable isotope evidence is mixed. Some studies show little plant use change but others indicate greater consumption of plants, especially grains, in the Early Neolithic. The availability of domesticated crops and livestock, as well as technological developments like the plough, enabled new subsistence strategies focused on cultivated plants and domesticated animals. 

Archaeological evidence clearly shows new plant and animal domesticates as well as tools and technology to support farming. The appearance of cereal grains like wheat and barley, and livestock such as cattle, goats and sheep represent new food sources in the Neolithic. New tool types such as querns for grinding grains, sickles for harvesting crops, and pots for cooking and storage also reflect transition to cultivation and herding. The construction of more permanent dwellings and storage facilities further signify settlement stability and surplus food production. All of these point to a shift away from wild resources to a diet based on domesticated crops and animals.

Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis provides direct evidence of dietary changes through the measurement of bone collagen and tooth enamel of human remains. Carbon isotopes indicate a shift from diets dominated by marine and freshwater protein in the Mesolithic to increased consumption of terrestrial plants and animals in the Neolithic. Nitrogen isotopes also show a trend from predominantly high trophic level protein to greater reliance on plant and lower trophic level animal foods. The combination of 13C and 15N therefore suggests a transition from diets high in wild fish and game to diets more focused on domesticated plants, cattle, sheep and goats. Some regional studies show only modest changes, however,  possibly due to locally specific transitions or methodological issues.

There are several limitations and sample biases inherent in stable isotope analysis that impact interpretations of dietary shift. Possible "isotopic Pooling" in pregnant or lactating women as well as "weaning effect" in infants can obscure dietary changes. Diets of certain populations like coastal or highland dwellers are also not always accurately reflected. Isotopic values are affected by many physiological and environmental factors, and dental enamel provides a snapshot only of childhood diet. Samples are often limited to certain burial sites, risking loss of information from unpreserved human remains. These constraints suggest stable isotope evidence must be interpreted carefully, especially when changes seem small. 

In summary, theories and models of the Mesolithic-Neolithic transition, archaeological material evidence of new subsistence economies, and stable isotope measurements of human diet all indicate a major shift from hunting and gathering to farming-based diets in Northwest Europe between the Late Mesolithic and Early Neolithic. While stable isotope methodology has significant limitations, the overall trend shows decreased reliance on wild foods and adoption of domesticated plants and animals as dietary staples. Interpreting this dietary change through multiple lines of evidence provides a more complete understanding of the Neolithization process in this region.
