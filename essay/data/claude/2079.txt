Here is a 500-word essay in response to the prompt:

Antioxidant enzymes and dietary antioxidants play an important role in the body by protecting cells against damage from free radicals and reactive oxygen species. Free radicals are molecules with unpaired electrons that can damage proteins, DNA, and lipids. Antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase, work by reducing free radicals before they can cause harm. Dietary antioxidants, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, beta carotene, and polyphenols, come from foods like fruits, vegetables, coffee, tea that help bolster the body's antioxidant defenses. 

The antioxidant capacity of fruit juices, teas, and coffees were determined using the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assay. The TEAC assay measures the ability of the compounds in the beverage to quench ABTS+ radicals compared to the antioxidant Trolox. The more ABTS+ radicals quenched, the greater the antioxidant capacity. Common dietary antioxidants found in fruits and vegetables include vitamin C, vitamin E, beta carotene, lycopene, quercetin, rutin, and anthocyanidins which give certain fruits their red and blue hues.

A strong correlation was found between the concentration of vitamin C and the absorbance value using the TEAC assay for the beverages. Beverages high in vitamin C like acerola cherry juice, berry juices, and citrus juices exhibited greater antioxidant capacity due to their high concentration of vitamin C, a potent antioxidant. Of the beverages tested, acerola cherry juice exhibited the greatest antioxidant capacity due to its naturally high level of vitamin C. 

Investigating antioxidant capacity is important to provide consumers guidance on the antioxidant content of foods and beverages. However, there can be variability in results between studies due to differences in the assay used, the compounds assessed, and other factors. Using standardized methods, reporting absolute antioxidant values rather than just relative rankings, and including multiple antioxidant assays can help improve reproducibility.

This information can help consumers choose foods and beverages to increase their antioxidant intake. The results suggest consuming plant-based foods and beverages high in compounds like vitamin C, anthocyanins, and other flavonoids which provide natural antioxidant benefits. While supplements may seem appealing, dietary antioxidants from whole foods and beverages likely have greater health impacts due to their complex mixture of beneficial compounds. Consuming a diet high in antioxidants can help support health and longevity.
