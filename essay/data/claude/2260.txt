The recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm is a useful technique for identifying the parameters of a dynamic system, such as a mechanical robot. The RLS algorithm works by using measurements of the inputs and outputs of the system to optimize the parameters that characterize the system. 

For a mechanical robot, the inputs are the control signals sent to the actuators in the robot, such as servo motors, and the outputs are measurements from sensors on the robot, such as position or velocity sensors. The parameters to identify are things like the gains and time constants in the transfer functions between the inputs and outputs. Identifying these parameters allows us to model the dynamics of the robot.

The RLS algorithm is an iterative method that uses new data as it becomes available to update the parameter estimates. It starts with an initial guess for the parameters and then refines the estimates with each new set of input-output data from the robot. The algorithm works by minimizing an objective function that is the sum of the squared errors between the measured outputs and the model-predicted outputs. The RLS algorithm finds the parameters that minimize this error function.

A key feature of the RLS algorithm is that it gives more weight to recent data than older data. It does this using a "forgetting factor" between 0 and 1. A forgetting factor of 0.95, for example, would weight the most recent data by 1 but data from 20 time steps earlier by 0.9520=0.36. This means the parameter estimates can adapt to changes in the robot dynamics. Without this feature, parameter estimates would be dominated by old data and slow to change.

Instrumental variables have an important role in the RLS algorithm for robot identification. In practice, not all inputs to a robot can be measured or controlled precisely. Unmeasured disturbances and noise can influence the outputs. Using instrumental variables, which are variables correlated with the disturbances but not directly controlling the outputs, can help address this issue. 

The instrumental variables are used to filter out the effect of disturbances from the parameter estimates in a process known as "instrumental variable estimation." They work by finding the parameters that make the outputs most correlated with the instrumental variables. By filtering out the disturbances in this way, the RLS algorithm using instrumental variables can identify the parameters of the robot dynamics even when subjected to unknown disturbances and noise.

In summary, the recursive least squares algorithm uses input-output data from a robot to iteratively estimate the parameters that model its dynamics. Features like the forgetting factor allow it to adapt to changes, while the use of instrumental variables helps ensure unmeasured disturbances do not negatively impact the parameter estimates. The RLS algorithm with instrumental variables is a powerful technique for identifying complex mechanical and robot systems.
