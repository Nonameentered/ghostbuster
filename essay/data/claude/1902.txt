Fluidisation occurs when a granular solid behaves like a fluid upon the application of an upward flow of liquid or gas. As the flow rate increases, the drag forces exerted by the fluid on the particles overcome the weight of the particles. This causes the particles to become suspended in the fluid, giving the appearance of a fluidised bed. The minimum fluidisation velocity refers to the minimum superficial flow velocity required to achieve fluidisation. 

Fluidised beds have many important applications in industry. They are used extensively in chemical processing for operations such as cracking, reforming, and polymerisation reactions. The large surface area of the suspended particles allows for efficient heat and mass transfer, enabling high rates of reaction. The vigorous mixing in a fluidised bed also results in uniform temperature distribution, which is important for reaction control.

Fluidised beds are also used for drying bulk solids such as grains, fertilisers, and minerals. The fluidising gas flow uniformly contacts the wet solid particles and carries away moisture, enabling rapid and uniform drying. Coal gasification and combustion also employ fluidised beds. Pulverised coal is injected into a hot fluidised bed of coal ash and limestone. The large surface area and good mixing enable complete combustion and efficient heat transfer. 

To determine the minimum fluidisation velocity, an experiment was conducted with 40-60 mesh silica particles in a glass column of 5 cm diameter. Water was pumped through a distributor plate at the bottom of the column at various flow rates. At each flow rate, the pressure drop across a known bed height was measured using a U-tube manometer.  

At lower flow rates, the silica particles remained fixed in position, acting as a packed bed. The pressure drop increased linearly with flow rate according to the Ergun equation. At a superficial flow velocity of 0.125 cm/s, small bubbles of particles just started fluidising but the majority of bed remained packed. This is known as the minimum bubbling velocity. 

As the flow rate was increased further, more bubbles formed and the bed expanded until it became fully suspended at a superficial flow velocity of 0.25 cm/s. This is the minimum fluidisation velocity. Beyond this point, the pressure drop across the bed remained constant at 25 cm of water. The results obtained are typical of Geldart's Group B particles, indicating that 0.25 cm/s is sufficient flow to overcome the weight of the particles and provide uniform fluidisation.

In conclusion, the minimum fluidisation velocity experiment determines the minimum flow rate needed to achieve a uniformly fluidised bed of particles based on the measurement of pressure drop across the bed at various flow rates. For the silica particles in water, the minimum fluidisation velocity was found to be 0.25 cm/s, at which point the bed pressure drop remained constant as the flow rate was increased further.  Fluidised beds have important applications in industry due to the enhanced rates of heat and mass transfer they provide.
