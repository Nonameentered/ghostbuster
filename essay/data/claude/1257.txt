The objectives of the laboratories focused on the Mitsubishi microcontroller M16C/62P were to illustrate the basic features of the microcontroller by programming it to perform several tasks. The procedure involved using the data sheets in the Appendix sections to understand the microcontroller's architecture, input/output ports, and peripherals. The author then used this information to connect external devices like 7-segment displays and push buttons to the appropriate input/output ports of the microcontroller to build a basic embedded system.  

To properly drive the 7-segment displays, the author referred to Appendix B, which provides the segment decode sequences to display digits 0 through 9. The displays were connected to Port 3 of the microcontroller. To read the push button inputs, the author connected the buttons to Port 1 and pulled the pins high using the internal pull-up resistors. By programming the microcontroller to set Port 1 pins as inputs and reading their logic levels, button presses could be detected.

The hardware used included the M16C/62P microcontroller, 7-segment displays, push buttons, resistors, a breadboard, jumper wires, and a 5V power supply. The microcontroller board featured the M16C/62P chip, clock crystal, reset switch, power regulator, and programming interface. The author connected the 7-segment displays to Port 3, push buttons to Port 1, power and ground rails to the power supply, and the microcontroller board to the PC's programming interface.

The Assi1.c and Assi2.c program files were used to demonstrate different skills. Assi1.c displayed a countdown from 9 to 0 on the 7-segment displays when a button was pressed. It illustrated use of the peripherals and Port 3 segment decoding. Assi2.c blinked "HELLO" on the displays, demonstrating a basic delay loop to control timing. The programs were compiled and downloaded to the microcontroller board, and upon resetting the board, the expected results of the countdown and "HELLO" blinking were observed.

In summary, the objectives of working with the M16C/62P microcontroller were to gain experience interfacing with and programming an embedded system to perform simple tasks. By following the procedures using the appendix references, connecting the necessary hardware, and writing and downloading the C program files, the author was able to successfully achieve the expected results from the microcontroller.
