The objective of the experiment to measure the moment of inertia of discs is to determine the rotational inertia of different discs experimentally and compare the values obtained with the theoretical calculations. The moment of inertia of an object about an axis characterizes its resistance to changes in its rotation about that axis. For a disc, it depends on the mass and the distribution of mass around the axis of rotation.

The experiment is conducted using a torsion pendulum setup consisting of a string attached to a rigid support at one end and the disc at the other end. The time period of oscillations of the pendulum is measured for different discs and used to calculate their moment of inertia based on the relation between the time period and moment of inertia for small angular oscillations. The discs used could include a solid disc, a hollow ring, and discs with slots cut out at different radii. 

The theoretical value of the moment of inertia for a solid disc of mass M and radius R about its central axis can be calculated using the standard formula I=MR2/2. For a hollow ring of mean radius R and mass M, the theoretical formula is I=MR2. The moment of inertia values decrease with the amount of mass concentrated at the center. The experimental values tend to be slightly lower than the theoretical values due to limitations and errors in the experiment.

Some sources of error include friction in the torsion pendulum setup, imperfections in the discs like non-uniform thickness or asymmetry, and diffraction of the pendulum resulting in nonlinear oscillations. Improvements such as using a frictionless suspension, precisely machined discs, and restricting oscillations to small angles can help increase accuracy. Digital timers and multiple trials can also help reduce error. 

In conclusion, the objective of measuring the moment of inertia of discs is achieved by comparing experimental results from a torsion pendulum setup with theoretical calculations for different discs. The experiment is a good demonstration of rotational dynamics but requires careful consideration of limitations and errors to obtain results close to the theoretical values. Improvements in experimental technique and setup can help achieve more accurate results.
