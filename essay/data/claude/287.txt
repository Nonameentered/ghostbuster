Here is a draft 1500 word essay in response to the prompt:

The photoelectric effect refers to the emission of electrons from a material when light is shone on it. The effect was first observed in the 1880s but could not be explained using the classical wave theory of light. Einstein proposed in 1905 that light also has particle-like properties, and that the photoelectric effect could be explained by absorbing photons, individual particles of light. Each photon has an energy associated with its frequency. When a photon is absorbed by a material, its energy can be transferred to an electron in the material, giving it enough kinetic energy to overcome the forces binding it to the material and escape (we refer to this minimum energy needed as the work function). By measuring the electron's kinetic energy or the amount of electrical potential needed to stop the electron (the stopping voltage), one can calculate the energy of the original photon and thus determine fundamental constants like Planck's constant.  

Planck's constant relates the energy of a photon to its frequency and can be calculated using the photoelectric effect. In an experiment, a photocell made of a photoemitter material like potassium or sodium and a collector electrode is exposed to a beam of monochromatic light from a laser or filtered lamp. The photoemitter material emits electrons when illuminated, which are collected by the electrode. A variable stopping voltage is applied between the electrodes to prevent any emitted electrons from reaching the collector. As the stopping voltage is increased, eventually all electrons will be stopped from reaching the collector. The voltage at which the photocurrent abruptly cuts off is the stopping voltage (Vs) for that frequency of light.

The kinetic energy of the emitted electrons can be calculated as KE = eVs, where e is the charge of an electron. The energy of the photons can also be calculated as E=hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency of the light. At the stopping voltage, the photon energy equals the electron's kinetic energy, so we can determine Planck's constant:  

h = eVs / f  

The experiment is subject to several sources of error. The measurement of frequency and stopping voltage may be imprecise. The work function of the material can vary slightly with crystal orientation and surface contamination. Multiple photons of slightly lower or higher frequency may also contribute to the stopping voltage. These errors will cumulatively result in some uncertainty and variation  in the calculated value for Planck's constant.  With careful control of the experimental conditions, however, this technique can provide a reasonably accurate way to measure Planck's constant and confirm its fundamental role in relating light and matter.
