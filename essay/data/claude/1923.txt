UHT or Ultra High Temperature processing involves heating milk and milk products to very high temperatures, around 135-150Â°C, for a few seconds to kill all bacteria and spores to achieve commercial sterility and extend the shelf life of the product. This process allows milk and milk products to be stored unrefrigerated for several months. While UHT processing has several advantages such as increased shelf life and reduced risk of food borne illness, it can negatively impact the quality and nutritional properties of milk.  

The type of heat exchanger used in UHT processing significantly impacts product quality. Direct heating systems that inject steam directly into the milk can lead to protein denaturation and create cooked flavors. Indirect heating using plate heat exchangers and tubular heat exchangers provides more gentle and uniform heating, resulting in better quality products. Indirect heating prevents the milk from contacting the heating medium directly, reducing risks of nutrient loss and off-flavors. Tubular heat exchangers in particular provide the most gradual heating and are best for premium UHT milk products.

UHT processing causes several chemical changes in milk that can impact quality. Lactose undergoes isomerization and browning which leads to loss of lactose and the development of a brownish tint. Proteins unfold or denature which can lead to loss of solubility, digestibility and susceptibility to proteolysis. Lipids may oxidize leading to faster development of oxidized and rancid flavors during storage. Vitamins like vitamin C and thiamine are also lost or degraded affecting the nutritional quality. These changes become more prominent with more severe heat treatments and higher temperatures.

Stored UHT milk undergoes additional quality changes over time that depend on several factors. The type of packaging used is critical - cartons provide little protection compared to hermetically sealed containers. Exposure to oxygen and light, especially UV light, catalyzes oxidation and alters proteins, despite commercial sterility. Storage temperature has a significant effect as well, with higher temperatures speeding undesirable quality changes. 

In summary, while UHT processing extends the shelf life of milk and reduces health risks, it can negatively impact nutritional and sensory quality by causing chemical changes during processing and storage. Careful selection of heating methods and processing conditions, high-barrier packaging, minimal exposure to oxygen and light, and refrigerated storage can help maximize the quality and shelf life of UHT milk products.
