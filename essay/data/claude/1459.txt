Here is a draft 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Graphological and semantic deviations in poetry, as well as sound patterning, can be effective techniques to create both cohesion and ambiguity in the meanings and messages that poems convey. The poems "Pan Recipe" by Margaret Atwood and "New World A-Comin'" by Charles Simic utilize these techniques to craft cohesive works that also contain ambiguity and double meaning.

In "Pan Recipe," Atwood uses inconsistent spacing, grammatical deviations, and semantic manipulations of familiar structures to build cohesion while introducing ambiguity. The poem is formatted as a recipe, with ingredients and cooking instructions, but the ingredients deviate from expected recipes in meaning and sequence. The familiar structure of a recipe creates cohesion, but lines like "Take 2 light blue eggs. Add 4 C nostalgia" introduce ambiguity through nonsensical ingredients (Atwood). The formatting implies a methodical set of instructions to follow but the content undermines the logic of that form.

Atwood also uses sound patterns like alliteration to create cohesion. The repetition of "l" and "b" sounds in "light blue eggs" and the "n" sound in "nostalgia" and "narcissus bulbs" ties those lines together sonically. However, the poem ends abruptly without resolving whether an actual dish can be created by following these instructions, leaving the overall meaning ambiguous. The cohesive sound and formatting patterns suggest there should be a resolution but it is left out, highlighting the ultimate nonsense of the "recipe."

Like "Pan Recipe," Simic's "New World A-Comin'" also utilizes familiar structures in unorthodox ways to build cohesion and ambiguity. The poem is formatted in four-line stanzas with a regular rhyme scheme and meter, suggesting a cohesive poetic structure. However, the content introduces surreal and nonsensical images like "my landlady...Taking wings,/Circling higher and higher/Above the backyards and the old garages" (Simic). The normal poetic form implies logic but is filled with fantastical, impossible scenes, creating ambiguity. 

Simic also repeats "come" and "coming" throughout the poem, with lines like "The new world's a-coming" and "What's coming, my landlady, coming is hell" (Simic). This repetition creates cohesion through sound patterning. However, the "new world" that is "coming" is never defined clearly, remaining ambiguous. Like "Pan Recipe," this poem achieves cohesion through sound and form but raises as many questions as it answers. The familiar is made strange in both works, crafting ambiguity and layers of possible meaning.

In conclusion, Atwood's "Pan Recipe" and Simic's "New World A-Comin'" demonstrate how deviations from the expected in form, content, grammar, and semantics can be cohesive when combined with repetitive sound patterns. The poems subvert familiar forms and logical sequences but tie the deviations together through alliteration, rhyme, rhythm, and repetition. The result is a cohesive yet ambiguous collage of surreal and unsettling images that could signify many possible interpretations. These poems show how cohesion and ambiguity need not be mutually exclusive in poetic works.
