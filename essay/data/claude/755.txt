The aim of the experiment was to determine the moment of inertia of three disks of different sizes. The moment of inertia, denoted by I, is a measure of an object's ability to resist rotational acceleration when a torque is applied. For a disk, the moment of inertia depends on the mass and radius of the disk. In this experiment, the moments of inertia of three disks with different radiuses were calculated using an experimental setup with a pulley system and then compared with the theoretical values. 

To calculate the moment of inertia experimentally, a disk was suspended horizontally from two cords that pass over a frictionless pulley at the top. A slotted mass hanger was attached to one cord, and slots allowed additional masses to be added. The disk was initially at rest, then a mass m was added to the hanger, which caused the disk to accelerate and rotate. The angular acceleration α of the disk was measured for different added masses, and the moment of inertia was calculated using the relationship I=T/α, where T is the torque provided by the added mass.

To ensure the accuracy of the measurements, several precautions were taken. First, the cords attaching the disk were lightweight but stiff to minimize stretching. The radii of the disks were precisely measured to calculate the theoretical values. The pulley was inspected to confirm it was frictionless. The angular position sensor had a small measurement error. Finally, multiple trials were conducted for each disk to determine experimental uncertainties, and results within the uncertainties were averaged.

With the data collected by measuring the angular acceleration of the disks under different added masses, the moments of inertia for the three disks were determined and compared with the theoretical values based on the disks’ geometry. The results were found to be in close agreement, thus validating the experimental procedure and confirming the relationship between an object's moment of inertia, mass, and radius of rotation. Overall, the experiment achieved its objective to calculate and compare the moments of inertia for the three rotating disks of different sizes.
