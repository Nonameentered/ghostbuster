The Drude model, proposed in 1900 by Paul Drude, provides a classical model of electron transport in metals. It treats electrons as classical particles moving freely through the metal lattice and undergoing elastic collisions with the lattice. This model explains some basic properties of metals such as electrical conductivity. However, it fails to account for many quantum phenomena that arise from the wave nature of electrons. The Sommerfeld model, proposed in 1927 by Arnold Sommerfeld, improves upon the Drude model by incorporating concepts from quantum mechanics. It provides a quantum mechanical treatment of free electrons in metals that can explain effects such as the Hall effect, magnetoresistance, and cyclotron frequency.

The Drude model treats electrons as point particles that move freely in the metal lattice between collisions. The velocity distribution is Maxwellian, following a classical probability distribution. The average drift velocity of electrons determines the electrical conductivity. However, this model cannot explain certain quantum effects observed in metals. The quantized nature of electron energies means that electrons can only inhabit discrete energy levels, not the continuous distribution of energies allowed classically. Also, the wave-particle duality means that electrons exhibit wave-like behavior, interfering with each other and diffracting. These quantum effects give rise to phenomena that contradict the predictions of the classical Drude model.

The Sommerfeld model incorporates quantum mechanics by describing electrons as Fermions that occupy quantized energy levels and exhibit wave-like behavior. Electrons are confined to quantized energy bands, and the Pauli exclusion principle limits each band to two electrons with opposite spin. The velocity distribution is Fermi-Dirac, with most electrons occupying states below the Fermi energy. This quantum treatment explains experimental observations that contradict the Drude model. For example, the quantization of energy levels accounts for the discrete electron spectra observed in metals. The wave nature of electrons explains diffraction effects. And the Fermi-Dirac distribution correctly predicts that most electrons have speeds near the Fermi velocity, not the range of speeds allowed classically.

Some phenomena explained by the Sommerfeld model but not the Drude model include the Hall effect, magnetoresistance, and cyclotron frequency. The Hall effect arises from the Lorentz force acting on moving electrons in a magnetic field. The Sommerfeld model correctly predicts that most electrons will deflect in the same direction, leading to a measurable voltage difference across the material. Magnetoresistance refers to the change in electrical resistance of a material in an applied magnetic field. The Sommerfeld model attributes this to the magnetic field disrupting the electron wavefunction and scattering electrons. Cyclotron frequency refers to the frequency at which electrons spiral in a magnetic field, which depends on electron mass. Measurement of cyclotron frequency provides experimental validation of the Sommerfeld model.

In summary, the Drude model provides a classical picture of free electrons in metals but fails to capture many quantum effects. The Sommerfeld model improves upon Drude's work by applying quantum mechanics to describe electrons as both particles and waves. It can correctly explain phenomena such as the Hall effect, magnetoresistance, and cyclotron frequency that contradict the predictions of the classical Drude model. By incorporating quantum concepts such as quantized energy levels, the Pauli exclusion principle, the wave nature of electrons, and the Fermi-Dirac distribution, the Sommerfeld model revolutionized our understanding of electron transport in metals.
