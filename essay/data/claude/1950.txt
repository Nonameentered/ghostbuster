Insular syndrome refers to a collection of traits frequently observed in animal populations that have been isolated on islands for an evolutionary long time. These traits include decreased size, loss of predator avoidance behavior, breeding atypically high population densities, and an increased extinction risk. Insular syndrome arises from  the unique evolutionary pressures experienced by island populations, including limited resources, relaxed predation, and lack of inter-population migration.

The wood mouse population on the Isle of Cumbrae in Scotland exhibits insular syndrome. A preliminary investigation found that the mice were smaller in size, less wary of potential predators, and living at a high population density compared to mainland wood mice. These observations aligned with the expectation that prolonged island isolation would produce populations exhibiting insular syndrome.

A subsequent trapping study was conducted to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the wood mice on Cumbrae. The trapping found that the wood mice population density on Cumbrae was over six times higher than that of wood mice in similar habitat on the mainland. The Cumbrae mice were also on average 10-15% smaller in body size. Few predators of wood mice were detected on the island. These results strongly suggest that the Cumbrae wood mice population is exhibiting insular syndrome, with increased density, smaller size, and lower predator avoidance likely arising from over 7,000 years of isolation on the island and release from predation pressure.

While the preliminary investigation and trapping study provided valuable insights, additional research is still needed to fully understand the wood mice and predator-prey dynamics on Cumbrae. A long-term population monitoring program should be established to track population density and body size changes over time. Comprehensive surveys for potential predators of wood mice, especially nocturnal raptors and carnivores, would help determine predation intensity on the island. Radio telemetry or direct observation could provide data on wood mouse behavior, habitat use, and interactions with other species. An assessment of available habitat and food resources would indicate whether they influence the wood mouse population.  

Overall, the insular wood mice of Cumbrae exhibit a classic case of insular syndrome. Their high density, small size, and lack of wariness point to evolutionary changes arising from island isolation and lack of predation. While preliminary research has been insightful, ongoing long-term monitoring and more detailed ecological studies are necessary to fully understand the dynamics of wood mice and other small mammals on the Isle of Cumbrae.
