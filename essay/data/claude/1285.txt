In sixteenth-century England, there was a relationship between prices, wages, and the level of theft prosecutions. When prices rose faster than wages, the real wages of workers declined, reducing their standards of living. This often led to higher levels of theft, especially of basic necessities. As a result, authorities prosecuted and punished more thieves during periods of high inflation and lagging wages. Several factors contributed to the fluctuations in prices, wages, and theft prosecutions in sixteenth-century England. 

First, prices in this period were often unstable due to poor harvests and crop failures. England at the time was a predominantly agricultural economy, so the harvest strongly influenced the supply and prices of key staples like grain. Poor harvests led to higher grain prices, while bumper crops resulted in lower prices. For example, in the 1590s, several years of bad harvests and resulting high grain prices coincided with a peak in theft prosecutions. Workers struggled to afford basic foodstuffs, so some resorted to theft.

Second, wars also contributed to price inflation and declining real wages. Wars disrupted trade and taxed resources. They often led authorities to debase the currency by reducing the precious metal content of coins. This injected more money into circulation and spurred price rises. At the same time, wars increased demand for resources like grain, meat, and wool, also pushing up prices. The long wars with France and Spain in the 1540s through 1560s corresponded with periods of rapid price inflation and more theft prosecutions.

Third, government monetary policies impacted prices and wages. When new silver and gold flowed into Europe from the New World, monarchs chose whether to spend the new specie or maintain the stable price of silver relative to goods. Often they spent freely, increasing the money supply and spurring price rises not matched by wage increases. This contributed to declines in workers' standards of living and likely higher levels of theft. In contrast, stable prices and wages benefited workers and corresponded with fewer prosecutions.

In conclusion, prices, wages, and theft prosecutions were closely linked in sixteenth-century England. Fluctuations due to poor harvests, wars, and monetary policies often reduced workers' real wages, leading to more theft and harsher crackdowns. Stability and prosperity, on the other hand, meant lower prices, steady wages, and fewer prosecutions. The relationship between prices, wages, and theft reflects the economic difficulties and cycles of boom and bust in this period. Overall, prosecutions ebbed and flowed based on the economic conditions of the time.
