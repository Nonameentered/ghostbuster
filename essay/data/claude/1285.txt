The automation of London's ambulance dispatch system in 1992 was meant to improve response times and the efficiency of dispatching emergency responders. However, the new computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system had significant issues that caused delays, errors, and put patients' lives at risk. There were several factors that contributed to the problems with the automated system, and a number of steps that could have been taken to prevent or mitigate these issues. 

One of the major issues with the new CAD system was that it relied on an outdated map database that often provided incorrect locations for emergency calls. The maps had not been updated for many years and did not account for recent changes in London's road network. This meant that ambulances were frequently dispatched to incorrect addresses, wasting critical time. To fix this, the ambulance service should have invested in updating the map database to the current road network before switching to the new CAD system. They also should have had procedures in place to get updated information from callers if ambulances went to the wrong locations.

Another problem was that the CAD system's algorithms for determining ambulance dispatch were flawed. The system did not properly take into account the severity of different medical emergencies and inappropriately prioritized some calls over others. For example, the system often prioritized less severe calls from wealthier neighborhoods. To address this, the algorithms should have been more rigorously tested to determine appropriate responses for different types of medical emergencies before being put in use. The London Ambulance Service should also have monitored the system closely after implementation to identify any calls that were mishandled so the algorithms could be quickly improved.

A third issue was lack of proper training for call handlers on using the new CAD system. Call handlers were not given adequate training in entering information into the system and instead had to rely on a rulebook. This resulted in call handlers frequently entering incorrect details into the system, which then dispatched ambulances improperly. Comprehensive training for all call handlers should have been mandatory before switching to the new system. Call handlers also should have been given opportunities to practice in simulated environments and get feedback to minimize errors.

In summary, the rollout of London's computer-aided dispatch system was flawed in several tragic ways. By updating their maps, rigorously testing the algorithms, meticulously training call handlers, and monitoring the system closely after implementation, many of the issues could have been avoided or resolved much sooner. Lives were put at risk due to the lack of proper precautions taken, but this difficult lesson ultimately improved emergency response systems in London and other cities.
