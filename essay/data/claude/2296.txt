Alternative substrates used in horticulture to replace peat moss have several advantages and disadvantages compared to the traditional peat substrate. Peat moss has historically been a popular substrate for plant growth due to its water retention properties, lightweight and porous nature, and relatively low cost. However, peat moss is not a renewable resource and its mining can damage sensitive ecosystems. Alternative substrates aim to address these sustainability concerns while still providing benefits for plant development and growth.

A major advantage of alternative substrates like coir, wood fiber, rice hulls, and perlite is that they are renewable and sustainable materials. Coir, made from coconut husks, is a byproduct of the coconut industry that would otherwise go to waste. Wood fibers and rice hulls are also recycled agricultural byproducts that can be composted and re-used. Perlite is a mined mineral, but it is abundant and reusable. These substrates therefore have a smaller environmental footprint than peat in terms of raw material usage and disposal. They are also often lighter than peat, providing cost savings for shipping and handling. 

However, alternative substrates differ from peat moss in their physical and chemical properties, which can impact plant growth in both positive and negative ways. For example, coir and wood fibers generally have higher air space and lower water holding capacity than peat moss, which can be an advantage for plants susceptible to root rot but may require more frequent irrigation for other plants. They also typically have a higher pH and electrolyte concentration than peat, which can affect the availability of certain nutrients. Perlite has extremely high air space, so it requires significant irrigation and fertilization management. 

The chemical and physical properties of substrates also affect their long-term storage and stability. Peat moss tends to break down very slowly over time, while coir and wood fibers decompose more quickly, releasing nutrients and altering air and water ratios. This can be managed to some extent by composting and aging the materials before use as substrates, but they still require more frequent monitoring than peat moss. Perlite does not break down over time so its properties remain very stable, but it is difficult to re-wet once it has dried out. 

In summary, while alternative horticultural substrates offer more sustainable raw materials and production processes compared to peat moss, they differ in properties that significantly impact plant development, nutrient and water management, and storage longevity. For most applications, coir and wood fiber substrates can work well as peat replacements with some adjustments to irrigation and fertilization rates. Perlite also has potential as a peat replacement but requires careful moisture and nutrient control. The ideal substrate for any given plant culture depends on balancing sustainability with how well the physical and chemical properties of the substrate meet the needs of the plants and their optimal growth conditions. With additional experience and research, alternative substrates should continue to improve as viable and environmentally-friendly alternatives to peat moss as a horticultural substrate.
