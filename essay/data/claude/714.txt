The method used to find the moment of inertia of three metal discs of different sizes during the laboratory session was the oscillation method. This involved suspending each disc at its center of mass using a thin fiber and timing the period of oscillation as the disc swung back and forth. The period of oscillation depends on the moment of inertia of the disc, according to the equation T=2π√(I/mgd), where T is the period, m is the mass of the disc, g is the acceleration due to gravity, d is the distance between the point of suspension and the center of mass, and I is the moment of inertia, which is the quantity to be determined.  

By measuring the period of oscillation multiple times for each disc and averaging the values, an accurate determination of T was obtained. The mass m of each disc was measured using a balance, and the distance d was measured using a ruler. The acceleration due to gravity g is a known constant. With all other variables measured or known, the equation was rearranged to solve for the moment of inertia: I=mgd(T/2π)2. The moment of inertia depends on how the mass is distributed in the disc, with more mass further from the center of mass resulting in a larger moment of inertia.

The results obtained for the moment of inertia of each disc were plotted on a graph with disc radius on the x-axis and I on the y-axis. According to the theory, the relationship between I and the radius r is I=k∙mr2, where k is a constant that depends on the mass distribution. The graph of the data points should yield a straight line, and by performing a linear fit, the slope of this line can be used to determine k, and the y-intercept can determine m. The values for k and m can then be checked against the measurements of T, m, d and g to confirm they are consistent.

Possible sources of error include imperfections in the discs that could result in discs not being symmetric about their center of mass, resulting errors in d. Imprecise measurement of T, m, and r could also contribute errors. If multiple trials were performed, variability in the data could indicate poor precision. Using the oscillation method with periodic timing to determine moment of inertia is a simple yet effective experimental technique to explore the physical meaning behind the concept of the moment of inertia of an object. Overall, the experiment demonstrated the validity of the theoretical equation relating I, m and r through the straight-line graph and consistency of the calculated and measured variables.
