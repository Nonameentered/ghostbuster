Several factors contribute to the successful formation of whipped cream. The ability to whip cream depends on the amount of fat in the cream and on the creation of air bubbles, which give whipped cream its light and fluffy texture. Environmental factors like temperature and equipment also play a role. However, there are some challenges that can prevent whip cream from forming properly. 

Fat content is one of the most important factors for whipping cream. Cream must contain at least 30% milk fat in order to whip properly. The higher the fat content, the better it whips. The fat in the cream coats air bubbles as the cream is whipped, allowing them to retain air. Lower-fat milks and creams, like half and half with 10-20% milk fat, will not whip at all. Whipping cream with 36-40% milk fat content is ideal for making billowy whipped cream.

The incorporation of air during whipping is essential for increasing the cream's volume and creating a light and airy texture. As the cream is whipped, tiny air bubbles are introduced. A mixer, whisk or other equipment is used to physically whip and aerate the cream. The sharp whisking motion breaks up the fat globules in the cream and distributes air bubbles throughout the mixture. The key is to not overwhip the cream, or the air bubbles may break down and the cream can become grainy. Whipped cream is best when soft or medium peaks formâ€”the cream should gently droop from the whisk.

Temperature also affects the ability to whip cream. Cold cream, especially chilled overnight, whips the best because the fat molecules are firmer in colder temperatures. As the cream is whipped, the motion of the whisk or mixer blades causes the fat molecules to warm up slightly, becoming pliable enough to allow for maximum air bubble volume but still firm enough to provide structure. Cream will not whip properly if it becomes too warm. However, cream that is too cold, near freezing, is also difficult to whip. Around 4 to 6 degrees Celsius or 40 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit is typically considered the ideal temperature range for whipping chilled heavy cream.  

Some challenges that can impede whip cream formation include high humidity, improper equipment, and overwhipping the cream. Excessively high heat and humidity can prevent the cream from whipping by softening the butterfat molecules too much. Electric mixers that are too large for the amount of cream or mixers that do not reach high enough speeds may not effectively aerate the cream. And overwhipping the cream can cause the air bubbles to break down, producing a grainy texture instead of a smooth and billowy whipped cream.

In summary, the key factors for successful whipped cream formation are sufficient fat content, proper aeration through whisking, ideal cold temperature, and avoiding overwhipping. When the right ingredients and conditions come together, it results in a light, delicious billow of whipped cream. But environmental conditions and equipment issues can present challenges and impede the ability to make good whipped cream. By controlling these various factors, cooks and bakers can reliably produce perfect homemade whipped cream.
