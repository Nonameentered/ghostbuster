Here is a draft 1500 word essay in response to the prompt:

A genre analysis involves systematically analyzing the features and conventions of a particular genre of writing or speaking. By understanding the common elements that characterize a genre, we are better equipped to produce and analyze texts within that genre. For the IELTS exam, conducting a genre analysis of formal and informal letters can help students understand how to structure and compose these letter types. 

Formal and informal letters have distinct features that students should understand. Formal letters, for example, typically have a formal and impersonal tone, use more complex and varied vocabulary and grammar, and have a clear and logical structure with an introduction, body paragraphs that flow cohesively, and a conclusion that reiterates the main purpose. In contrast, informal letters adopt a more personal and casual tone, use simple vocabulary and grammar, and have a loosely structured format.

To apply a genre analysis approach, students can examine model letters to identify these key features. They can analyze elements like the layout, organization, vocabulary, grammar structures, and tone used in each letter type. They can look for patterns across examples to determine conventions. Students should also analyze the language choices in the model texts using theories of register and pragmatics.

Register theory analyzes how language use varies based on the context and topic. For formal letters, students would expect a formal register with less colloquial language. For informal letters between friends, a more casual register would be appropriate. Students can assess if the vocabulary, grammar, and tone match the intended formality or informality. They can then apply these insights to their own writing.

Pragmatic principles relate to how language is used to achieve a communicative goal or speech act. For formal letters, the speech acts may be complaining, requesting, or applying. Students should analyze how the language and content are tailored to achieve the act, e.g. using modal verbs for requests or listing relevant experiences for a job application. For informal letters, the speech acts would relate to sharing news, describing experiences, or asking for advice based on the writer's relationship and intent. Students would analyze if the content and language choices reflect these purposes.

Conducting a comprehensive genre and linguistic analysis of formal and informal letters equips students with the tools to understand these genres fully and compose cogent letters for the IELTS exam. Students will understand not just the structural conventions but also how to manipulate language, content, and tone to suit their intended purpose and audience. With practice, students can apply these analytical skills to any writing genre and gain valuable insights into how effective written communication works.
