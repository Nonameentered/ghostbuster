Palynological and macrobotanical evidence provides significant insights into Mesolithic subsistence systems and the interactions between humans and their environments during that period. Pollen, plant macrofossils, and charcoal recovered from archaeological sites and natural deposits can reveal details about the vegetation composition surrounding the sites, the potential plant resources available and used by the inhabitants, forest disturbance and clearance, and seasonal movements. However, the interpretation of this evidence requires caution due to various methodological and interpretational limitations.

Pollen analysis has been instrumental in reconstructing Mesolithic vegetation and environments. The pollen preserved in bogs, lakes, and archaeological sites provides a record of the local and regional plant communities. A high diversity of tree pollen, especially of hazel, oak, elm, lime, and alder, indicates the prevalence of mixed deciduous woodlands. Variations in the pollen assemblages and concentrations may reflect natural environmental changes or human interference like forest clearance. For example, a decline in tree pollen and an increase in the open-ground taxa can suggest woodland clearance and disturbance. However, natural factors like forest fires can also lead to similar changes. So, multiple lines of evidence, like the macrofossil record, are needed to distinguish anthropogenic from natural causes.

Plant macrofossils provide direct evidence of plant resources used and the environment. Charred plant remains like hazelnut shells, beechnuts, and apple/pear seeds recovered from Mesolithic sites indicate the inhabitants exploited these forest resources. The uncharred plant remains deposited in natural sediments surrounding the sites can also reflect the local vegetation and resources. The presence of plants with disturbed ground preferences, such as docks, around the sites may suggest human activity like forest clearance. But again, the potential role of natural disturbances in the deposition of some plants should be considered.

The charcoal residues provide another significant line of palaeobotanical evidence. An increase in microscopic charcoal particles in natural sediments and archaeological layers can indicate the frequent use of fire, either through natural wildfires or deliberate firing of woodlands by humans to clear forests or promote certain resources. When correlated with changes in arboreal pollen and the appearance of disturbance-loving plants, charcoal evidence can help determine the anthropogenic origin of environmental changes. However, varying charcoal preservation and deposition may influence interpretation.

The seasonal availability of certain plant resources and environmental variations can also be understood using palynology and macrofossil analysis. For example, peaks in hazelnut shells may suggest occupation during autumn when hazelnuts ripen. Similarly, pulses of certain disturbance indicators can reflect seasonal clearance or harvesting activities. These seasonal signals, when combined with settlement pattern data, provide insights into potential mobility and subsistence strategies. However, the complexities in deposition and preservation limit definitive interpretations. 

In conclusion, while palaeobotanical studies have been critical in understanding Mesolithic subsistence and environment, the interpretations need to be made cautiously considering the methodological and interpretational limitations inherent in this evidence. When used in combination with other archaeological data, palaeobotany can provide significant insights into human-environment interactions in the Mesolithic.
