The lattice parameter refers to the distance between identical lattice points in a crystal lattice. It is a characteristic property of a substance and can be used to identify different materials. For example, consider two crystalline solids: sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium chloride (KCl). Both have a face-centered cubic crystal structure, but the lattice parameter of NaCl is 5.64Å while that of KCl is 6.28Å. The difference arises because the K+ ion is larger than the Na+ ion.

Now consider a mixed sample containing both NaCl and KCl crystals. When x-rays are directed at this sample, the diffraction pattern will show two separate sets of peaks corresponding to the two lattice parameters. By measuring the angles and intensities of these peaks, the amounts of NaCl and KCl in the mixed sample can be determined. The more intense set of peaks will correspond to the component present in greater amount. 

The lattice parameter is especially useful in identifying substances with similar or identical crystal structures. For example, the alkali metals Li, Na, K, Rb and Cs all crystallize in a body-centered cubic lattice, but their lattice parameters increase progressively from 3.51Å for Li to 6.61Å for Cs, following the increase in atomic size down the group. By determining the lattice parameter, these similar substances can be distinguished.

In summary, the lattice parameter is a characteristic property of a crystalline solid that depends on the geometry of its crystal lattice and dimensions of the molecules or ions. By measuring the lattice parameter, different substances can be identified and the components of a mixture can be determined. Even when the crystal structures of substances are very similar, their lattice parameters allow us to distinguish them based on differences in ionic or atomic size.
