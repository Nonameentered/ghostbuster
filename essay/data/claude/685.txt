Bulimia Nervosa (BN) is an eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, fasting, or excessive exercise. BN is categorized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) based on the frequency and severity of the binge eating and compensatory behavior episodes over a period of 3 months.  

To be diagnosed with BN, an individual must meet the frequency criteria of at least once a week for 3 months and display a lack of control over eating during binge eating episodes which are characterized by eating an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances. The binge eating episodes are also associated with at least three of the following: eating much more rapidly than normal, eating until uncomfortably full, eating large amounts of food when not hungry, eating alone because of embarrassment, and feeling disgusted, depressed, or guilty afterwards.

Some common symptoms of BN include frequent fluctuations in weight, menstrual irregularities in women, swelling of the salivary glands, and erosion of tooth enamel. Frequent vomiting can also lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and gastric ruptures. Other physical signs include calluses or scars on the knuckles from self-induced vomiting.

BN affects approximately 1-2% of the population and is most common in females between the ages of 15 to 24. The prognosis depends on the severity and duration of the illness as well as compliance with treatment. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is considered the most effective psychotherapeutic treatment for BN. CBT helps individuals develop coping strategies to avoid binge eating and compensatory behaviors, challenge dysfunctional thoughts about eating, body shape and weight, improve self-esteem, and develop a healthier relationship with food. With treatment, 60% of individuals achieve remission from bulimic symptoms.

In summary, BN is a serious mental illness that requires diagnosis and treatment from a medical professional. CBT has been shown to be an effective means of managing symptoms and achieving remission. Early diagnosis and intervention provide the best opportunity for full recovery.
