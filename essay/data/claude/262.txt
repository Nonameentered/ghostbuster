Here is a draft 500-word essay in response to the prompt:

Potential causes of hip pain include injuries, overuse, arthritis, bursitis, and muscle or tendon strains. However, in the elderly population, the most concerning cause of hip pain is a broken hip, also known as a femur fracture. A broken hip should be suspected if the pain is severe, does not improve with rest or over-the-counter anti-inflammatories, and causes difficulty walking or inability to bear weight. 

On examination, a broken hip may manifest as swelling, bruising, or deformity over the hip area. Leg length discrepancy or rotation may also be present. Range of motion will be limited and painful. Diagnosis is confirmed with X-rays of the hip, which will reveal the fracture site and pattern. For an older person, a broken hip can have devastating consequences. It often leads to loss of independence and mobility. Prolonged bed rest during recovery also increases risks of infection, blood clots, and muscle atrophy.

Psychologically, the trauma of breaking a hip and changes in life circumstances can lead to depression and anxiety in up to 50% of elderly patients. In the UK, the incidence of hip fractures is over 65,000 cases per year, and up to 30% of patients die within a year of the injury, especially older males. Hip fractures also account for the largest number of acute orthopedic hospital admissions, demonstrating the substantial healthcare costs.

In summary, hip pain in the elderly should prompt an evaluation for a possible broken hip given the drastic implications. Restricted mobility, psychological distress, loss of independence, and increased mortality pose serious challenges for recovery. Prevention through medication, lifestyle changes, and fall risk reduction are key in this vulnerable population. With an aging population, the personal and societal impacts of fragility hip fractures will continue to grow.

The essay provides an overview of potential causes of hip pain and focuses on discussing a broken hip, including examination findings, implications for the elderly, incidence and mortality rates in the UK context, and a summary conclusion.
