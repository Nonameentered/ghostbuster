The focus of this material selection report is choosing an appropriate material for a bicycle crank arm. The use of the Cambridge Engineering Selector aids in this decision-making process by providing key information on material properties that guide the selection. 

In Part 1 of the report, the key design criteria for a bicycle crank arm are identified including strength, stiffness, density, corrosion resistance, and cost. The Cambridge Engineering Selector is used to filter through a database of over 4,000 engineering materials according to these criteria. This results in a shortlist of four feasible options: aluminum alloys, titanium alloys, magnesium alloys, and fiber-reinforced plastics. By inputting numerical values for the desired properties, the Selector identifies materials that meet all minimum requirements. 

Part 2 evaluates the four shortlisted options in more detail. Graphs from the Selector show how the options compare in terms of important metrics like strength-to-weight ratio and elastic modulus-to-density ratio. For each material, the types of processing and fabrication methods are outlined, as well as typical applications.  This helps to determine how suitable each option is for a bicycle component. Cost is also considered based on industry data.

In the end, an aluminum alloy is chosen because it offers a good combination of strength and stiffness for its weight and reasonable cost. The analysis and data from the Cambridge Engineering Selector throughout the report supported this evidence-based decision. Together the identification of key criteria, initial filtering based on desired values, comparison of shortlisted options on multiple metrics, and consideration of cost and manufacturability paint a complete picture for choosing the most suitable material for this application. Overall, the report demonstrates how using a materials selection tool like the Cambridge Engineering Selector facilitates systematic and objective decisions in materials selection for engineering design.
