Here is a 238-word essay response:

Canning fruits and vegetables involves several procedures to ensure the quality and safety of the preserved products. First, the raw materials must be prepared by washing, peeling or trimming, and grading for ripeness and quality. This removes dirt, pesticides, and damaged or spoiled parts that could affect quality or safety. Next, some fruits and vegetables are soaked or blanched in boiling water or steam to inactivate enzymes and assist peeling. These heating steps help preserve texture, color, and nutrients during canning.   

Some fruits are canned in a sugar syrup or brine to add sweetness or saltiness. A light to heavy syrup is made of water and sugar, and the density depends on the natural acidity and sweetness of the fruit. Fruits canned in syrup will have added sugar, while those in brine or juice retain natural sweetness. Vegetables are usually canned in a brine solution or water, though some like carrots and green beans are also packed in syrup. The acidity or alkalinity of the packing liquid must be balanced to preserve safety. 

Finally, the packed jars undergo sterilization by boiling in a water bath or use of a pressure canner. Boiling jars in a water bath is suitable for high-acid fruits. The elevated temperature kills microorganisms and creates an airtight seal. Pressure canning uses steam under pressure to reach higher temperatures needed to kill spoilage bacteria in low-acid vegetables and meat. Proper timing and pressures are critical to kill all microorganisms and avoid under- or over-processing.  

Thus, the canning process centrally involves preparation of high-quality raw materials, use of syrups or brines suited to the fruit or vegetable, and a sterilization method that achieves temperatures adequate to kill spoilage microorganisms and seal jars. Following approved canning procedures helps ensure a safe product with maximum nutrition, flavor, texture, and shelf stability.
