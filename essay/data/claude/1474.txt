Stealing by Ian McEwan and Morvern Callar by Alan Warner share several key similarities in how they challenge traditional notions of contemporary society pertaining to religion, gender, and identity. Although diverse in their settings and plots, both stories feature young male narrators struggling to understand the world and their place within it as they embark on unguided journeys of self-discovery. 

In Stealing, the novella’s epigraph from Nietzsche sets the tone for the protagonist’s rejection of religious mores: “Belief is always most desired, most pressingly needed where there is a lack of will.” The narrator, a precocious preteen, systematically commits crimes ranging from shoplifting to burglary, seeking to overcome his feelings of purposelessness and ineptitude that stem from the restrictive rules imposed by the Catholic boarding school he attends. His acts of theft are motivated more by a desire for autonomy and control over his circumstances than by the items themselves. Through his quiet defiance of both legal and religious rules, the narrator begins to shape an identity independent of the one prescribed to him.

Morvern Callar likewise grapples with religion and identity, featuring a 21-year-old protagonist plagued by existential angst in a small port town in Scotland. Morvern’s boyfriend has recently committed suicide, leaving behind a novel for her to publish under her own name. Morvern’s apathy and detachment throughout the tragic ordeal and aftermath suggest a deep-rooted uncertainty about life’s meaning that has been left unaddressed by the constraints of mainstream religion and society. Her impulsive trip to Spain with her friend Lanna funded by the advance from the novel enables her to temporarily escape these existential questions through hedonism and irresponsibility. However, Morvern ultimately avoids confronting her own identity by publishing the novel as her own, and her future remains unclear.

Both stories also subvert traditional gender roles. The narrators in Stealing and Morvern Callar reject the rules and responsibilities imposed on them from an early age, as emphasized through imagery of the school uniforms they feel suffocated by. Morvern especially challenges the societal expectations of mourning through her seeming indifference to her boyfriend's death and desire to party in Spain rather than grieve. The characters yearn for autonomy and adventure in a way that transcends gender, seeking purpose and meaning in life through unconventional means.

Stylistically, Warner and McEwan employ strategies that mirror their themes of constraint, individuality, and the shortcomings of language. Stealing is told in a minimalist style from the limited perspective of a child just acquiring language and struggling to understand the world, using simple and repetitive sentences. This emphasizes the narrator’s restricted ability to express himself freely through words, paralleling his stifled individual identity. Conversely, Morvern Callar utilizes experimental punctuation and run-on sentences to represent Morvern’s unconstrained stream-of-consciousness and her dysfunctional attempts to string together some sense of meaning and purpose.

In conclusion, Stealing and Morvern Callar are unique coming-of-age stories that reveal the authors’ similar views on religion, gender, and identity in contemporary society. Stylistically and thematically, the texts suggest that true meaning, purpose, and identity emerge when one overcomes the limitations - both internal and societal - that govern thought and behavior. The quest for individual freedom and self-actualization, though difficult to achieve or express, is shown to be of paramount importance. Overall, the stories point to the mutability of language and thought, and to the human capacity for breaking free from constraint.
