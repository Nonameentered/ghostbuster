Here is a draft 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

The Jominy End Quench Test is used to determine the hardenability of steels, which is a measure of a steel's ability to form hardened structures when quenched. In the test, a steel bar is heated to an austenitizing temperature where it transforms to a face-centered cubic crystal structure. One end of the bar is then quenched in water, while the rest of the bar is exposed to air and cools more slowly. The hardness is then measured along the length of the bar. Steels with higher hardenability will achieve high hardness further from the quenched end. 

EN9 and EN24 are medium carbon steels with good hardenability for general engineering uses. EN9 has 0.5% C and achieves a maximum hardness of 270 Brinell Hardness Number (BHN). It has medium hardenability, so is good for components like axles, shafts and gears. EN24 has 0.4% C and 1% Cr, giving a maximum hardness of 280 BHN and better hardenability, so is used for more highly stressed components like crankshafts.

Hardenability is important to ensure the right steel is chosen for an application. Highly stressed or impact-loaded components require steels with high hardenability to achieve hardness through the thickness, preventing failure. Components like gears also need high surface hardness but softer cores. Medium hardenability steels can achieve this. Low hardenability steels are used when low hardness and toughness are required.  

Adding alloying elements like chromium, molybdenum and nickel increases hardenability. They reduce the transformation rate of austenite to ferrite and pearlite, allowing martensite to form at slower cooling rates. This prevents cracking as the steel cools and allows hardness to penetrate further into the steel.

The Jominy results for 070M55 and 817M40 show this effect. 070M55 has 0.7% C and 0.55% Mn, giving low hardenability, reaching 225 BHN only 25mm from the quenched end. 817M40 has 0.17% C, 0.4% Mn, 1% Ni and 0.25% Mo, giving high hardenability and 310 BHN hardness 75mm from the quenched end. The nickel and molybdenum significantly increase the hardenability.

Hardening is a heat treatment process where a steel is heated then quenched to form martensite, which increases hardness and strength. The austenitising temperature depends on the alloying elements. Steels are quenched in water, oil or air depending on the hardenability and mechanical properties required. High hardenability steels are water quenched, medium steels oil quenched, and low hardenability steels air quenched. Hardening is necessary for components like gears, shafts, tools and knife blades to improve wear and impact resistance.

In summary, the Jominy End Quench Test determines the hardenability of steels. EN9 and EN24 are medium hardenability steels used for general engineering. Hardenability ensures the right steel is chosen for an application and is increased using alloying elements. Results for 070M55 and 817M40 show the effect of molybdenum and nickel on hardenability. Hardening steels through quenching and forming martensite improves their hardness and strength.
