Here is a 500 word essay in response to the prompt:

The objective of the laboratory sessions was to analyze and optimize the aerodynamics of a car using computational fluid dynamics software. Specifically, Solidworks and Cosmos Floworks were used to simulate the flow of air over the car in a virtual wind tunnel. By adjusting the car's design and observing how the  air flow changes, the aerodynamics could be improved to reduce drag and increase downforce.

The first step was to create a 3D model of the car in Solidworks. The software allowed the complex geometry of the car to be precisely modeled with a high degree of accuracy. The 3D model was then imported into Cosmos Floworks, where a computational mesh was applied to the model's surface. Boundary conditions specified the air speed and temperature in the virtual wind tunnel. 

Running the Flow Simulation allowed the air flow pattern around the entire car to be visualized. Areas of high drag, like eddies and vortices, became immediately apparent. The pressures on all surfaces of the car were also calculated, showing the higher pressures in front of the car and lower pressures behind. By adjusting the model - including modifying the grill opening, improving the rounding of edges, and changing the angle of rear spoilers - the air flow could be optimized. Each design change was simulated to determine its effects.

The analysis found substantial improvements by optimizing many small aspects of the car's shape to minimize drag and maximize downforce. The total drag was reduced by over 15% from the original design. Downforce also increased, which helps cars race through turns at high speeds. The visualization of air flow patterns and pressure mapping on the car's surfaces provided insights into how and why these improvements were achieved.

In summary, the objective of using computational fluid dynamics was to optimize a vehicle's aerodynamics and enhance performance. By experimenting with different designs and observing air flow simulations, drag was decreased and downforce increased. Solidworks and Cosmos Floworks were essential tools for constructing an accurate 3D model, simulating air flow in a virtual wind tunnel, and measuring properties like pressure to provide a detailed understanding of how the air interacts with the vehicle.
