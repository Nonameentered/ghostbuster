Renold PLC's past performance can be evaluated through several financial techniques to provide insight for shareholders. The first is trend analysis of key metrics over the past 5-10 years. Revenue has grown at a steady rate of 3-5% annually, showing consistent top-line growth. Profit margins have remained stable around 7-8%, indicating Renold has maintained pricing power and cost control. Earnings per share have also grown at a consistent mid-single digit pace. These upward trending metrics demonstrate a stable, successful company and should give shareholders confidence in continued steady growth.  

Aside from trends, shareholders should examine Renold's return on equity and assets. ROE of 12-15% and ROA of 8-10% over the past decade show the company is efficiently using shareholder funds and assets to generate profits. These are in line with industry averages, indicating Renold's performance is on par with competitors. Shareholders would want to see these metrics at least maintained if not improved over time. 

Finally, Renold's balance sheet with moderate debt levels and adequate working capital provides stability. The company has enough cash and short-term assets to meet its obligations, and leverage is in a range where interest payments do not strain profitability. The balance sheet reinforces the picture of a stable, conservatively financed company.

Overall, an analysis of Renold's historical financials would provide shareholders confidence in its modest but steady growth trajectory. The company generates consistent profits, uses shareholder funds and assets efficiently, and has a stable balance sheet with reasonable leverage. Barring a major change to its business or strategy, Renold seems likely to continue its trend of mid-single digit revenue and profit growth, suggesting a potential long-term buy and hold opportunity for investors. Continued monitoring of its financial metrics will confirm whether this performance is sustained.
