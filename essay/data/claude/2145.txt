Categorizing prenominal modifiers, specifically determiners, in the English language presents several challenges. Determiners are words like articles (a, an, the), demonstratives (this, that), possessive nouns (my, your), and quantifiers (some, any, no) that come before nouns and establish the identity or quantity of the noun phrase. However, classifying determiners into neat categories is complicated by the fact that some determiners exhibit the characteristics of multiple categories or change categories based on context.

One challenge is that some determiners can function as multiple types. For example, the determiner some acts as a quantifier when used with count nouns, as in “some books,” indicating an indefinite quantity. However, it acts as a determiner of indefiniteness with mass nouns, as in “some information.” The determiner any also shifts between quantifier and determiner of indefiniteness based on context. Another example is the determiner no, which usually acts as a quantifier indicating zero quantity but acts as a determiner of indefiniteness in phrases like “in no time” or “no big deal.” 

A second challenge stems from the fact that determiners can shift categories based on the type of noun they modify. For instance, the determiner that acts as a demonstrative pronoun when modifying a count noun, as in “that book.” However, it functions as a determiner of definiteness equivalent to the definite article the when modifying a mass noun, informal expression, or idiomatic phrase, as in “that information,” “that kind of day,” or “that’s that.” Similarly, the determiner those acts as a demonstrative pronoun with plural count nouns but as a determiner of definiteness with mass nouns or idiomatic phrases, e.g. “those books” vs. “those belongings” or “those were the days.”

A third challenge lies in the dual nature of some determiners as either prenominal modifiers that come before nouns or pronominal elements that stand in for nouns. For example, the determiners this, that, these and those can function either as demonstrative determiners that come before nouns, or as demonstrative pronouns that replace nouns, e.g. “this house” vs. “this is beautiful.”  Similarly, the determiner none acts as an indefinite pronoun in sentences like “none were left” but as a prenominal quantifier in phrases like “none remaining.” The dual nature of these determiners poses difficulties for neat classification.

In conclusion, while determiners can be broadly categorized as articles, demonstratives, possessives, or quantifiers, classifying them into a single category is complicated by the fact that some determiners exhibit characteristics of multiple categories or change categories based on context. The challenges stem from determiners that act as more than one type of determiner, determiners whose category changes based on the type of noun they modify, and determiners that function either as prenominal modifiers or pronominal substitutes. A comprehensive classification system must account for all these complexities.
