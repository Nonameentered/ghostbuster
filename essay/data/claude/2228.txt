Here is a 2250 word essay in response to the prompt on the evidence for the big bang theory and an expanding universe:

There are several key pieces of evidence that support the scientific theory that the universe began roughly 13.8 billion years ago with the big bang and has been expanding ever since. First, the observation that the universe is expanding was made in the 1920s by Edwin Hubble. By observing distant galaxies, Hubble found that the light from nearly all of them was redshifted. This means that the wavelength of the light was stretched out towards the red end of the spectrum. This is an effect caused by the expansion of space itself as light travels through it. The more distant a galaxy was, the more its light was redshifted. This showed that space itself has been stretching between us and distant galaxies over time.

Second, the discovery of the cosmic microwave background in 1964 confirmed a key prediction of the big bang theory. Scientists realized that the hot, dense early universe would have glowed with radiation. As the universe expanded and cooled, this glow would now appear as faint microwave radiation. Two scientists discovered this faint microwave background and found it matched exactly the wavelength that had been predicted. This background radiation is remarkably even and uniform, giving us a glimpse of what the universe looked like when it was just 380,000 years old.  

A third line of evidence is the measured abundance of light elements in the universe, especially hydrogen, helium, and lithium. When the universe was very hot and dense, nuclear fusion would have generated these light elements. As the universe cooled, this fusion would have stopped. By measuring the amounts of these elements, we find they match exactly what would be predicted based on calculations of fusion in the first few minutes of the universe. This is a confirmation that the hot, dense conditions necessary for this fusion existed early on.
