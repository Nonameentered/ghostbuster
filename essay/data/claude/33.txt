The purpose of this experiment was to determine the moment of inertia of three discs of different radii by applying Newton's Second Law to rotational motion. The moment of inertia is a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotation, analogous to mass in linear motion. By measuring the torque and angular acceleration of the discs, their moments of inertia could be calculated using the relationship I=T/α, where I is moment of inertia, T is torque, and α is angular acceleration. 

To determine the moments of inertia, a string was wrapped around the circumference of each disc and attached to a hanging mass to provide the torque. The angular acceleration of the discs was measured as the hanging mass fell and unwound the string, pulling the discs and accelerating their rotation. According to Newton's Second Law, the torque is equal to the moment of inertia times the angular acceleration. By measuring T and α, I could be calculated for each disc.

The results showed that the moment of inertia increased with increasing disc radius, exhibiting the expected physical behavior. The moment of inertia depends on how mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation. Discs with larger radii have more mass at greater distances from the axis, leading to a higher moment of inertia. The experimental moments of inertia for the three discs were in good agreement with the theoretical values calculated using the equation for a solid disc, confirming the validity of the assumptions and experimental method.

In this experiment, the method of measuring torque from an unwinding string and angular acceleration from motion tracking allowed for the indirect determination of the moment of inertia, which would otherwise be difficult to measure directly. However, several assumptions were made, including treating the discs as solid, uniform discs. Making justifiable assumptions is important in any experiment to simplify the analysis, but the results must be interpreted considering these assumptions and their possible impacts. In this case, the close agreement between the experimental and theoretical values suggests the assumptions did not significantly impact the conclusions regarding the relationship between disc radius and moment of inertia.

In summary, the purpose of this experiment was to investigate the moment of inertia of objects of different sizes. By applying Newton's Second Law to relate torque, angular acceleration, and moment of inertia, the latter could be determined for each disc. The results exhibited the expected behavior of increasing moment of inertia with radius and agreed with theoretical predictions, supporting the validity of the experimental method and assumptions in achieving the purpose. Overall, the experiment demonstrated the usefulness of relating fundamental physical laws to understand rotational motion.
