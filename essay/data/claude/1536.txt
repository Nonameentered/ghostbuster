Wilkinson, a London based publishing company, recently acquired Hoopoe, a small independent publisher focused primarily on literary fiction and poetry. Wilkinson now needs to determine how to integrate Hoopoe into its organization. There are two main options: keep Hoopoe as a separate imprint or fully integrate Hoopoe's operations and list into Wilkinson's business. Each option has implications for Wilkinson's structure, culture, motivation strategies, and change management approach.

If Wilkinson keeps Hoopoe as a separate imprint, it can maintain Hoopoe's independent brand identity and culture, which is focused on publishing artistic works that may not have mass commercial appeal. This approach has the benefit of retaining Hoopoe's authors and minimizing culture clash. However, it also means Hoopoe's operations remain largely separate. This can reduce cost savings and synergy opportunities from integration. It may also result in unhealthy internal competition if the imprints are competing for authors, resources, and market share. This structure requires clear rules and management oversight to make the relationship work. 

Full integration of Hoopoe into Wilkinson eliminates the imprint model and folds Hoopoe's list and operations into Wilkinson's broader business. This allows for greater cost savings, consolidated business functions, and a single company culture. However, it also means Hoopoe's unique brand identity and culture will be lost. There is a high risk of culture clash if Wilkinson's commercial focus and mass market interests conflict with Hoopoe's artistic sensibilities. Wilkinson would need to carefully manage this integration to retain key Hoopoe staff and authors while reshaping culture. 

The Boston Matrix can be useful for analyzing Hoopoe's list to determine which books should be prioritized or divested under each model. Hoopoe's high-quality literary books that break even or lose money may be cross-subsidized by Wilkinson in the imprint model to maintain the brand's artistic reputation. In the full integration model, Wilkinson may choose to divest some of these titles to improve overall profitability, unless they believe they can significantly boost sales with a larger marketing push. Midlist commercial titles that show growth potential may receive more marketing investment under the full integration model. 

Wilkinson should consider lessons from other publishing mergers and imprint relationships. Imprint models can thrive when there is a shared vision for how the imprint fits into the organization, sufficient autonomy for imprint staff, and no direct competition for the same authors or readers. Full integration models tend to succeed when there are open lines of communication, a thoughtful approach to reconciling company cultures, and a willingness to make hard decisions to divest lists or staff that may not suit the new organization's priorities.

In summary, Wilkinson must weigh the pros and cons of an imprint model versus full integration of Hoopoe based on its strategic goals, compatibility of organizational structures and cultures, and ability to manage change. With careful planning and management, either model could succeed, but Wilkinson needs to go into the integration with its eyes open to the challenges of merging two distinct publishing houses.
