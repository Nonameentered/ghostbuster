A recent survey conducted at Oxford Brookes University provides insights into students' interest in history as an academic subject and leisure activity. Overall, the findings suggest that while students recognize the importance of studying history, many do not pursue it as a leisure activity or have a strong interest in it outside of their studies. 

The Oxford Brookes survey found that 66% of students believed studying history was important for a well-rounded education. However, only 22% said they were "very interested" in history as a leisure activity. A plurality, 39%, were only "somewhat interested." This matches broader trends seen in two larger surveys of UK students. A 2018 survey by YouGov found only 21% of students aged 18 to 30 were very interested in history during their leisure time. A 2019 survey by Statista found only 24% of UK students considered themselves "history buffs."

Students' interest in history seems to depend on the specific historical topic or period. According to the Oxford Brookes survey, students were most interested in learning about the history of their own university and city (52% very or somewhat interested), as well as family history (42%). They were least interested in prehistoric history (15% interested) and medieval history (22%). The YouGov survey similarly found the 20th century, World Wars, and local history were of highest interest, while pre-1700 history interested only 15% of students.

Despite many students recognizing the value of studying history, few seem to frequently engage with it during their leisure time through visiting museums. Only 28% of students in the Oxford Brookes survey visited history museums once a month or more. A majority (54%) visited a few times a year or less. The YouGov survey also found only 21% of young people visited museums regularly. However, among those who did visit museums, history museums were the most popular type, suggesting appeal for certain students.

In summary, while many students at Oxford Brookes and more broadly acknowledge the importance of studying history for a well-rounded education, most do not seem to pursue it avidly as a leisure interest or pastime. Their interest in specific historical topics skews towards more recent periods and events, especially those with a personal or local connection. And fewer students engage with history through frequent museum visits. However, history museums do remain the most popular type of museum for those students who do choose to visit them. Overall, the findings suggest history engages some students deeply but most in a more casual and passive manner.
