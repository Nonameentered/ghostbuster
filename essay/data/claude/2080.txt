The Bradford and Lowry protein assays are two commonly used methods for quantifying protein concentration in various samples. Both assays have advantages and disadvantages, and they may yield different results depending on the sample type. To determine the protein content of two kinds of milk - cow's milk versus soy milk - both assays could be used, but some differences in results would likely be obtained.

The Bradford assay relies on the binding of Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 dye to proteins in an acidic solution. The dye binds to primarily basic and aromatic amino acid residues, causing a shift in absorption that can be measured with a spectrophotometer at 595 nm. The advantages of the Bradford assay are that it is very simple, rapid, and inexpensive. However, its disadvantages are that it is not very specific to protein alone and can be affected by other compounds like detergents. It also has a limited linear range of 2 to 14 micrograms per mL. For milk samples with higher protein contents, dilutions would need to be made to stay within this range, adding uncertainty. 

The Lowry assay involves two reactions - the Biuret reaction and the reduction of the Folin reagent. The Biuret reaction produces a purple-colored complex in the presence of peptide bonds, while the reduced Folin reagent produces another color change measurable at 750 nm. The Lowry assay typically has a higher sensitivity and wider linear range than the Bradford assay. However, it requires more steps and reagents and has more interference from other compounds. It can overestimate protein concentrations compared to other methods like Kjeldahl nitrogen determination.

When used to determine protein levels in cow's milk versus soy milk, differences would likely arise between the Bradford and Lowry methods. Cow's milk contains about 3.5% total protein by weight, the vast majority of which is casein and whey proteins like beta-lactoglobulin with aromatic amino acids. The Bradford assay would likely yield a higher protein determination for cow's milk due to its sensitivity toward these amino acids. In contrast, soy milk contains about 3 to 4% plant-based proteins with different amino acid profiles. The Lowry assay might provide a more accurate assessment of total protein in this case since its sensitivity is less dependent on specific amino acids. However, for both milks, the values obtained could still differ from the Kjeldahl method, which determines total nitrogen and converts it to protein content.

In summary, while the Bradford and Lowry assays each have their pros and cons as rapid protein determination methods, they may produce different results for given samples due to variations in sensitivity and specificity. For complex samples like cow's milk and soy milk, multiple methods may need to be employed to accurately assess and compare protein levels. Care should be taken in interpreting the results from any single method.
