Selecting a suitable material for a high-pressure gas transportation cylinder is a crucial step in the design process. The material must meet several constraints related to strength, fracture toughness, corrosion resistance, and cost. The Cambridge Engineering Selector (CES) materials database and software package provides a useful toolkit for narrowing down material options based on these constraints.  

The main objectives in selecting a material for a pressure vessel are:

1. High strength: The material must be able to withstand the high internal pressures of the contained gas without yielding or fracturing. The minimum yield strength and ultimate tensile strength are key parameters.

2. Fracture resistance: The material must have high fracture toughness to avoid brittle failures, especially for low-temperature applications. Charpy impact energy is a key measure of fracture toughness. 

3. Corrosion resistance: The material must resist degradation from exposure to the contained gas and any impurities or residues. Corrosion resistance depends on the material and any coatings or treatments.

4. Cost: The material and any fabrication costs must be balanced with the performance requirements. Lower-cost materials may require thicker walls to meet strength needs.

The CES software allows filtering materials by these constraints to determine suitable options. By inputting the minimum required yield strength, tensile strength, Charpy energy, and acceptable cost range, the list of materials can be narrowed. The categories of materials for pressure vessels include:

1. Steels: Steels are a common choice due to their high strength, adequate fracture resistance, and low cost. Carbon steels require thicker walls but are very low cost. Alloyed steels like chrome-molybdenum steel provide higher strength at thinner walls but higher cost. Stainless steels add corrosion resistance at a premium.

2. Aluminum alloys: Aluminum alloys provide high strength-to-weight ratios but lower absolute strength, so walls must be thicker. They have good fracture toughness and corrosion resistance. More alloyed grades provide higher strength at higher cost.

3. Composites: Fibre-reinforced polymer composites provide high strength with light weight and no corrosion concerns. However, they tend to be more expensive and can be limited to certain temperature ranges.

4. Titanium alloys: Titanium alloys offer excellent strength and corrosion resistance but at very high cost, mostly limited to niche applications.  

There are several standards governing the design and testing of pressure vessels, including ASME BPVC, CSA Z245, and EN 13445. These specify rules for wall thickness, welding procedure, non-destructive testing, cyclic testing, and safety factors required for different pressure and temperature regimes. Materials must be selected to meet these standards based on the specific application.

In summary, selecting a material for a pressure vessel requires balancing multiple constraints to find suitable and cost-effective options that meet the performance requirements. Databases like CES provide the necessary tools to filter through the options based on quantitative constraints. The final selection depends on the exact needs of the application and operating conditions. With so many options available, there are many possible materials for optimized solutions across a range of applications.
