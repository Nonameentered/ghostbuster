Here is a draft 3000-word essay in response to the prompt:

Beauty adverts create and reinforce understandings of feminine beauty by utilizing a range of symbolic and photographic codes that portray an idealized version of what is considered attractive and desirable for women. This essay analyzes two beauty adverts for Dove and Dior perfume to identify the predominant ideologies they construct regarding femininity and how perfume, in particular, is challenging to advertise given its lack of denotation. 

The 2018 Dove advert analyzed (Appendix 1) challenges predominant ideologies of feminine beauty by focusing on inclusivity, naturalness, and empowerment. The photographic codes center ordinary women of various body shapes, sizes, ethnicities, and ages. The color scheme is muted and natural, matching the tagline “beauty comes in all forms.” The relatable and natural settings make the women appear comfortable and confident in their own skin. The use of natural lighting reinforces the focus on their natural, unretouched beauty. The linguistic codes including “celebrate,” “diverse,” and “real” further the message of inclusivity, empowerment, and self-acceptance.

In contrast, the 2011 Dior perfume advert (Appendix 2) conforms to and reinforces dominant ideologies of feminine beauty and gender roles. The central figure is a glamorous, made-up model in a pale pink satin dress gazing into the distance. The setting is equally glamorized. Her passive, disengaged stance coupled with the flowy dress, pale colors, and flowers connote traditional feminine ideals of beauty, purity, and domesticity. The linguistic codes of “J’adore” and “the new mythical floral fragrance” point to the fantastical and unattainable nature of her image. The inclusion of the prominent Dior brand logo demonstrates how perfume adverts rely heavily on branding to denote luxury and status in the absence of an actual product.

While the  fragrance industry faces difficulties in depicting their ephemeral product, these adverts take contrasting approaches through their use of symbolic and photographic codes. The Dove advert relies on qualities of naturalness, relatability, and inclusivity to denote beauty coming “in all forms.” The Dior advert draws on more conventional feminine beauty ideals and fantastical glamour. Both ultimately use branding to link the abstract idea of the fragrance to constructed feminine identities and gender roles.

In conclusion, an analysis of these adverts reveals how beauty brands both challenge and conform to dominant ideologies of feminine beauty and gender to appeal to their target audiences. Perfume in particular must rely on strong branding and fantastical marketing given its lack of denotation. Overall, these adverts illustrate the power of advertising to both reflect and shape cultural understandings of feminine beauty and identity.
