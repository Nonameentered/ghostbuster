Modality refers to the expression of possibilities, necessities, and contingencies. In linguistics, it originated from philosophical concepts of modal logic, which studied the logic of possibility and necessity. Modal logic identified alethic modality, referring to logical possibility and necessity.  Linguists adopted this concept and expanded it to include other types of modality expressed in natural language.

Two major branches of modality studied in linguistics are epistemic modality, referring to possibility and necessity based on knowledge and belief, and deontic modality, referring to possibility and necessity based on rules and obligations. Epistemic modality expresses the speaker's judgment about the likelihood that a proposition is true or that an event will occur. It deals with degrees of certainty and uncertainty. For example, "It may/might/could rain tomorrow" expresses epistemic possibility, while "It must/should/will likely rain tomorrow" expresses epistemic necessity.

Deontic modality, on the other hand, is concerned with obligation, permission, and ability. It expresses what is obligatory, permitted, and possible according to some set of rules or moral order. For example, "You must/shall/have to go to school today" expresses deontic necessity or obligation. "You may/might/can have a cookie after dinner" expresses deontic possibility or permission. 

Other types of modality that have been identified include dynamic modality, expressing ability, willingness, and readiness, and evaluative modality, expressing the speaker's attitude about the desirability or importance of an event. Modality is thus a broad semantic category that covers a range of possibilities, necessities, and contingencies expressed in natural language.

While modality originated as a semantic concept, it has grammatical manifestations in many languages. Modal verbs like can, may, must are common markers of modality. Some languages also have modal particles, modal auxiliaries, and modal inflections or morphemes. The grammatical forms for expressing modality interact with the semantic categories...
