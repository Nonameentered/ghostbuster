X-ray powder diffraction or XRD is an analytical technique that is often used in forensic science to analyze unknown materials and determine their chemical composition and structure. XRD uses X-rays to bombard materials of interest and measures the diffracted X-rays as they are scattered by the sample. Based on the diffraction pattern, the geometry and spacing of atoms in the crystal lattice can be determined, which enables identification of the chemical and phase composition.

XRD has several advantages that make it suited for forensic applications. It is a non-destructive technique, so only a small amount of sample is required and it can be analyzed without significantly damaging or changing its composition. It also provides very specific chemical information, enabling identification of compounds even when present in mixtures. However, XRD also has some drawbacks. It can only be used to analyze crystalline materials, not amorphous solids or liquids. The analysis requires specialized equipment and expertise to operate, and the interpretation of diffraction patterns can sometimes be ambiguous or difficult.

In forensic science, XRD is commonly used for contact trace evidence analysis, identifying unknown traces of materials transferred between people or objects. It is useful for identifying unknown powder, fibers, or mineral traces. XRD is also frequently used in drug analysis to identify illegal substances, especially when present in powder form. It can determine polymorphs of drugs and differentiate chemically similar compounds. XRD is useful in explosive and post-blast residue analysis, identifying components in unknown explosive formulations or solid residues left over from detonations that could provide clues about device composition or construction.

An example that demonstrates the use of XRD in forensic science is the analysis of an unknown white powder seized from a crime scene. Initial colorimetric tests were inconclusive, so XRD was employed. The resulting diffraction pattern showed prominent peaks characteristic of cocaine hydrochloride, allowing for the identification of the unknown material. The specificity of the match gave high confidence in the result, enabling investigators to determine the nature of the seized material without damaging the majority of the evidence.

In summary, X-ray powder diffraction is a useful analytical technique in forensic science due to its ability to provide detailed structural and chemical information about crystalline materials in a non-destructive manner. Although it has some limitations, XRD is a robust and reliable method for analyzing contact trace evidence, drugs, and explosives. When used in combination with other analytical techniques, XRD can be a powerful tool for determining the identity of unknown substances and gaining valuable insights for forensic investigations.
