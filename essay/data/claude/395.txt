Here is a draft 740-word essay in response to the prompt:

Educational drama methodology can be highly effective for language learning. When used in an English summer camp, drama activities can create a meaningful context for communication, boost students' self-confidence, promote social cooperation, and enhance learner autonomy.

A five-day English summer camp organized by a university in Taiwan provides an excellent example of how drama can be leveraged for these benefits. The camp featured a number of drama activities, including improvisation games, role plays, and short scripted performances. These activities provided authentic contexts for students to communicate in English with purpose and meaning. For example, in improvisation games where students took on different roles and personalities, they had to spontaneously generate dialogue to advance the scene. In role plays and scripted sketches, students conveyed emotions and brought characters to life through verbal and non-verbal communication.  

Such active use of language in meaningful social interactions built students' self-confidence in their English abilities. Where students may have felt inhibited speaking in a traditional classroom setting, the playful and collaborative nature of drama activities helped them overcome anxiety and encouraged them to take risks using English. Through the experience of performing for others, students gained confidence in their speaking skills and ability to engage an audience.  

The drama activities also fostered a strong spirit of social cooperation. Students had to work together constructively in groups to develop improvised scenes, prepare and rehearse role plays, and put together short performances. Resolving any issues around coordinating schedules, assigning roles, and navigating interpersonal dynamics required teamwork, compromise, and a shared sense of purpose. The interdependence built through the drama activities led to new friendships and a cohesive group dynamic.

Finally, the drama approach promoted learner autonomy by giving students more control and ownership over their learning. Students were actively involved in making creative choices to shape their performances. They also supported each other through peer feedback and encouragement. The collaborative learning environment made learning self-directed and student-centered rather than teacher-dominated.

In summary, educational drama methodology used in an intensive English program provides an engaging context for authentic communication, increases self-confidence, builds social skills, and develops learner autonomy. While focused on an English summer camp, these benefits of drama activities would apply equally to any language classroom. Drama is a compelling approach for language learning that teaches students skills beyond just vocabulary and grammar.
