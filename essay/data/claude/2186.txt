There are several methods for determining the water content of foodstuffs. Oven drying involves heating a sample in an oven at a set temperature, usually around 105°C, until there is no further loss of mass.  The change in mass represents the amount of water present. This method is useful for solid foods. Distillation involves boiling a liquid sample and condensing the resulting water vapor. The distilled water is collected and its volume measured. For safety, lower boiling solvents like acetone or petroleum ether can be used instead of water. 

Starch can be identified in plants using the iodine test and microscopy. Iodine solution dropped on a plant sample will turn dark blue in the presence of starch. Under a microscope, starch granules have a distinctive appearance depending on the plant source. They can be oval, spherical, prismatic, etc. The shape and size of granules are useful for identification. Viewing starch granules under polarized light shows a Maltese cross pattern due to the concentric layers of amylose and amylopectin molecules.

Experiments with sausage meat involved oven-drying samples to determine water content and microscopic examination of starch. Oven-drying at 100°C showed sample A lost 47% of its mass, indicating it contained 53% water. Microscopy detected oval starch granules identified as wheat, indicating wheat flour was added as a filler. Sample B lost only 12% of its mass, indicating 12% water, and contained no starch granules, showing it was all meat. These experiments demonstrated the use of the two methods to analyze the composition of foods.  

In summary, the water content can be obtained through oven drying and related techniques. Starch can be identified microscopically based on granule shape, appearance under polarized light, and iodine staining. Experiments with sausage meat demonstrated using oven drying and microscopy to determine water content and presence of starch fillers. Understanding food composition is important for safety, quality control, and authentication.
