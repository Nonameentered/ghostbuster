Cohesive devices and structural patterns are crucial tools used by authors to strengthen the cohesion, coherence, and overall impact of a written fairy tale. These strategies are particularly important in fairy tales given the genre's focus on fantastical and often fragmented elements. By employing cohesive devices like repetition, parallelism, and transitional words, and using a consistent structural pattern, fairy tale authors are able to craft a tight-knit story from potentially disparate parts.

One of the most common cohesive devices used in fairy tales is repetition. Fairy tales frequently repeat phrases, words, and even entire sentences to tie different parts of the story together and lend a sense of rhythm. In the Grimms' fairy tale "Snow White," for example, the evil queen repeatedly asks her magic mirror "mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?," and each time the mirror responds "you are the fairest here so true, but Snow White is fairer still than you." This repetition helps to unite the different scenes in which the queen consults the mirror, while simultaneously reinforcing the queen's obsession with being the fairest in the land. 

Parallelism, or using similar grammatical forms, is another key cohesive device in fairy tales. The repetition of sentence structure creates symmetry and flow in the story. In "Hansel and Gretel," parallelism is used prominently: "The thick forest closed around them...The thick forest opened before them." The parallel sentence construction links the two parts of the forest, despite the fact that the children go from being lost and trapped to finding their path home. The parallelism gives a sense of coherence to their journey through this strange and variable place.

Transitional words like "so," "then," "next," and "after that" are also commonly used in fairy tales to create connections between events and maintain coherence. In "Little Red Riding Hood," the author uses transitional phrases throughout to link scenes: "One day, Little Red Riding Hood's mother said to her..."; "So Little Red Riding Hood put on her red cloak and basket, and set off to see her grandmother"; "Not long after that, a wolf came along." These transitions guide the reader smoothly through the sequence of events in the story.
