Here is a 500-word essay in response to the prompt:

The sum of exponential models generated theoretically and using the Nelder-Meade simplex algorithm differ in how their parameters are determined and optimized. The theoretical model relies on estimating parameters based on the mathematical form of the model and initial experimental data. The parameters are chosen to provide the best fit to the initial data, but may not provide the optimal fit as more data becomes available.

The Nelder-Meade simplex algorithm, on the other hand, optimizes the parameters by iteratively modifying them to minimize the sum of squared errors between the model and the experimental data. It starts with an initial guess for the parameters but then searches for the combination of parameters that provides the best overall fit to all the available data. As more data becomes available over time, the simplex algorithm can continue to find the optimal parameter values to fit the new data. 

For example, consider a theoretical sum of exponentials model with two exponential terms, A1e-k1t + A2e-k2t, fit to a limited initial data set. The parameters A1, k1, A2, and k2 would be estimated to provide the best fit to the initial data. However, as more data points become available over time, the theoretical model with fixed parameters may no longer provide an optimal fit. The Nelder-Meade simplex algorithm, on the other hand, can re-optimize the parameters to fit the new data points. It may find, for example, that different values of A1, k1, A2, and k2 provide a better overall fit to all the data, new and initial.

In summary, the key difference between the theoretical and Nelder-Meade sum of exponential models is that the theoretical model has fixed parameters estimated from limited initial data, while the Nelder-Meade model has optimized parameters that can change to fit new data. The Nelder-Meade model is therefore able to provide a superior fit to experimental data, especially over long periods of time or as more data becomes available. For any data set, the Nelder-Meade model should generate a sum of exponentials fit that is as good as or better than the theoretical model.
