Global warming refers to the current rise in the average temperature on Earth. Over the past century, the Earth's average surface temperature has increased by about 1 degree Fahrenheit, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The causes of global warming are well established and include the emission and accumulation of heat-trapping greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Deforestation, burning of fossil fuels, industrial activities, mining, and transportation all release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and worsen global warming.

The primary causes of global warming are:

1. Burning of fossil fuels - The combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas releases carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Since the Industrial Revolution, human activities such as burning fossil fuels have caused a 40% increase in atmospheric CO2. Fossil fuel emissions have been the largest contributor to the increased CO2 in the atmosphere. As we continue to burn more and more fossil fuels for energy and transportation, global warming increases.

2. Deforestation - Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the air. When trees are burned or decay, carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. Tropical rainforests store large amounts of carbon so when they are cut down or burned, that carbon is released, contributing to global warming. Deforestation is responsible for about 20% of world carbon dioxide emissions according to scientists.

3. Industrial agriculture - Industrial agriculture produces carbon dioxide emissions through various farming practices and the use of equipment that burns fossil fuels. It also produces methane and nitrous oxide emissions, which are more potent greenhouse gases. Fertilizers used in industrial agriculture also release nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide.

The consequences of global warming are dangerous and alarming. Some of the major impacts of global warming include: rising sea levels which lead to coastal flooding; more frequent and intense extreme weather events; irreversible damage to ecosystems and loss of biodiversity; threats to food security; worsening wildfires; spread of diseases; and severe heatwaves. Urgent action needs to be taken to mitigate and adapt to global warming. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy can help curb this urgent problem.
