Oticon, a Danish hearing aid manufacturer, faced significant business pressures in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Increased competition from multinational corporations and a decline in market share threatened Oticon's future. In response, Oticon's CEO Lars Kolind made radical changes to the company's organizational culture and structure, utilizing innovative HR policies to empower employees and boost motivation, creativity, and productivity. 

To overcome competitive pressures, Kolind transitioned Oticon to an open, non-hierarchical "spaghetti organization." Traditional departments and managerial levels were eliminated. Employees were organized into flexible, cross-functional project groups and given autonomy over their work. Kolind aimed to create a knowledge-sharing, collaborative culture where good ideas rose to the top regardless of seniority or position.

To support the new spaghetti organization, Kolind optimized the motivational function of rewards and recognition. Performance appraisals and rankings were eliminated. Instead, intrinsic motivators were emphasized, like interesting work, opportunities for growth, and contributing to a meaningful purpose. Kolind also implemented profit-sharing and generous benefits to motivate employees.

The changes at Oticon were informed by McGregor's Theory Y, which posits that people are self-motivated and enjoy intellectual stimulation at work. The spaghetti organization and emphasis on intrinsic rewards reflected a belief in employees' capacity for creativity and self-direction. 

The new organizational model and HR policies were highly successful. Oticon's innovations led to improved products, lower costs, and reversal of declining market share. By empowering employees through organizational change and supportive HR practices, Kolind transformed Oticon's culture and overcame considerable business challenges.

The case of Oticon illustrates how radical organizational change, enabled by progressive HR policies, can help motivate and empower employees to adapt to difficult business conditions. By dismantling hierarchy and bureaucracy, nurturing intrinsic motivation, and encouraging knowledge sharing, Oticon optimized its human capital and regained competitive advantage. Oticon's turnaround demonstrates the power of organizational culture and HR policy in addressing external business threats. Overall, the changes implemented at Oticon in the early 1990s provide a compelling example of how HR innovation and progressive management can motivate employees and drive business success.
