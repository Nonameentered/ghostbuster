System identification refers to techniques for obtaining a dynamic model of a system based on observations of the system's input and output. It is a crucial step for various applications such as adaptive control, parameter estimation, and signal processing. The most common approaches for system identification are least squares and recursive identification methods. Recursive identification, such as recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm, works by processing data as it becomes available and updating the model parameters accordingly, rather than batch processing the entire data set at once. This is very useful for adaptive control and real-time estimation, where the model parameters need to be updated continuously.  

The RLS algorithm can be used to estimate the parameters of a model for a mechanical robot, known as the “master” of a master/slave telemanipulator system. The first step is to obtain data by feeding random input signals to the master robot and recording the measured outputs. The input and output datasets can then be used to estimate the model parameters with RLS. We start with an initial guess of the parameters, and at each step update the parameters to minimize the sum of squared errors between the measured outputs and the model outputs. The updating is done recursively by using the previous parameter estimates and a new data pair at each step.  

 Instrumental variables can be included in the RLS algorithm to account for correlated noises in the input and output data which can bias the parameter estimates. The instrumental variables are used to produce corrected input and output data with uncorrelated noises, which are then used for parameter estimation. Alternatively, we can model the noises using a partial least squares model and include it in the RLS algorithm. The noise model helps filter out the noise from the data before they are used to update the parameter estimates at each recursion.

Using RLS algorithm with optional noise modeling, we can obtain model parameters that accurately represent the dynamic behavior of the master robot. The recursive nature of the algorithm allows rapid convergence and tracking of the parameter values in a changing system. The estimated model can then be used to control a “slave” robot to mimic the movement of the master in real time. In summary, the RLS algorithm is an effective tool for system identification and adaptive control of mechatronic systems such as master/slave telemanipulators. With the inclusion of noise models, it can provide optimal parameter estimates despite colored noises.

In conclusion, system identification is crucial for modeling dynamical systems and enabling applications such as adaptive control and signal processing. Among various techniques, recursive least squares algorithm is particularly useful for real-time estimation and control. For a mechanical system such as a robot, RLS can be used to obtain an accurate model by estimating parameters that minimize errors between measured and model outputs. The addition of noise modeling further improves the parameter estimates in the presence of correlated noises. RLS algorithm, especially when combined with noise modeling, is an effective approach for identifying and controlling complex mechatronic systems.
