Here is a 750-word essay in response to the prompt:

Is it a good idea for companies to ignore the internet as a way of selling policies? 

In today's digital world, the internet has become an integral part of how we do business and access information. Companies that fail to utilize the internet as a way to market and sell their products run the risk of being left behind by more innovative competitors. At the same time, implementing new technologies requires careful planning and management to be successful. Companies that rush into digitizing their services without proper oversight often end up facing costly failures.  

There are significant benefits for companies that leverage the internet to sell their policies and services. The internet provides access to a much wider potential customer base. With more people relying on the internet to research and buy products, companies can tap into new markets that were previously difficult to reach. Digital services are also often more convenient for customers, allowing them to access information and complete purchases on their own time. This added convenience and access can drive increased sales.

However, the challenges of shifting policies and services online should not be underestimated. Companies have to invest in new technical infrastructure, train employees, and overhaul their current systems. Without proper project management, companies can end up wasting money and frustrating customers. For example, in 2013 HealthCare.gov suffered a disastrous roll-out of its website to sell health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The site was riddled with technical issues that made it difficult for people to sign up for plans. The companies contracted to build the website severely underestimated the scope of the project, and lack of oversight and coordination led to a waste of hundreds of millions of dollars.

Project management best practices can help avoid such failures. First, companies should conduct thorough research on the technical requirements of the website or digital platform. They need to understand security, privacy, and compliance issues related to selling policies online. Next, they should analyze the costs and benefits to make sure the investment will have a good return. Then, they must define clear goals, requirements, and oversight for the project to keep it on budget and schedule. Finally, extensive testing of the platform before launching it live will identify any issues and allow them to be addressed. 

In conclusion, while companies should not ignore the internet as a way to sell their policies, they need to be prudent in how they implement these new digital channels. Careful research, planning, oversight, and testing can maximize the benefits of a wider customer base and streamlined services while avoiding expensive failures. The internet may be an essential part of business today, but companies must digitize thoughtfully and strategically to truly reap the rewards.
