Here is a draft essay in roughly 1500 words on how Oscar Wilde's novel "The Picture of Dorian Gray" explores the concept of degeneration as defined by Cesare Lombroso and Max Nordau:

Oscar Wilde's only novel, "The Picture of Dorian Gray," published in 1890, examines the idea of degeneration that was prominent during the Victorian era. Two key proponents of theories of degeneration were the criminologist Cesare Lombroso and the cultural critic Max Nordau. Lombroso focused on biological determinism and the concept of the "born criminal," someone who exhibited physical signs of degeneracy. Nordau extended theories of degeneration to culture and society, arguing that modern art and literature in the 1880s exhibited degenerate characteristics that were detrimental to society. 

In Wilde's novel, the characters express concern over degeneration and moral decline. Lord Henry warns Dorian he must "be careful not to allow yourself to become coarse," expressing a fear of social and moral degradation. Dorian himself muses that "there is not one good portrait in a hundred that is not spoiled by the sitter." The novel suggests there is something rotten not just in certain individuals but in society as a whole.

However, the novel also satirizes and critiques theories of degeneracy and the moral panic over cultural decline. While Dorian lives a life of sin and hedonism, the physical portrait decays and exhibits grotesque changes, reflecting Dorian's spiritual and moral degeneration. But Dorian himself remains physically unchanged and beautiful, undercutting Lombroso's notion of physical markers of degeneracy. Many saw Wilde himself as a "degenerate artist" purveying moral decay, yet Wilde mocks fears over degeneration and suggests that true degeneration lies in the eye of the beholder. The portrait is a metaphor for how we project our own fears and corrupted morals onto others.

In "The Picture of Dorian Gray," Wilde cleverly examines the Victorian anxiety over degeneration and cultural decline. But while he acknowledges decay and moral concerns, he also satirizes theories that pointed to degeneration in art and individuals. Wilde suggests degeneration is often in the mind or morals of the perceiver rather than the perceived. The novel is an important critique of prominent theories of degeneracy in the Victorian era and still resonates with contemporary explorations of morality and society. Overall, Wilde creates a complex exploration of the concept of degeneration and its varied meanings in the late 19th century.
