Here is a 2000-word essay in response to the prompt:

Compare and contrast the function of the writers' techniques in analyzing the characters of Quoyle and Estha in passages 4a) and 4b), respectively. 

Both passages 4a) and 4b) employ a variety of literary techniques to analyze and develop the characters of Quoyle and Estha, respectively. In passage 4a) by E. Annie Proulx, the character of Quoyle is developed through descriptive details, metaphorical language, and ironic juxtaposition. In passage 4b) by Arundhati Roy, the character of Estha is developed through vivid sensory imagery, repetition, and parenthetical asides. 

To begin with, Proulx uses specific descriptive details to paint a vivid picture of Quoyle's awkward appearance and demeanor. She describes him as a "great damp loaf of a body" with "little eyes" and a "startled look." These unflattering descriptions characterize Quoyle as drab, clumsy, and dimwitted in the reader's imagination. The overall effect is to evoke pathos for this underdog character. 

In contrast, Roy employs sensory imagery and repetition to develop Estha's character. Through descriptions of the "green mango with a school badge collar," the "Elvis puff," and "the vaguely lemon-flavored smell" of Estha, Roy allows the reader to see, hear, smell, and feel what Estha does. The repetition of "Tomorrow" and "Oh well" creates a rhythmic quality that mimics Estha's thought processes. This immerses the reader in Estha's perspective and psychology.

Proulx also uses metaphorical language and ironic juxtaposition to deepen the reader's understanding of Quoyle. The metaphor of Quoyle as "a damp loaf of a body" suggests heaviness, clumsiness, and lack of mobility. The ironic fact that Quoyle's signature "news articles were short, dull, and lifeless" yet he is assigned to report on car wrecks and seabird behavior only highlights his unsuitability for the job and adds a layer of dark comedy. 

In contrast, Roy's use of parenthetical asides provide insight into Estha's memories, psyche, and emotional state. Remarks like "(Now he doesn't do anything)" and "(The man on the veranda in the Play. With a moustache)" give the reader a glimpse into Estha's troubled past and fractured mental state in a poignant way. The asides have an almost conversational, confessional quality as if Estha is voicing his inner thoughts.

In summary, while Proulx and Roy utilize different literary techniques, they serve a similar function in developing rich and complex protagonists that elicit empathy from the reader. The descriptive details of Quoyle's inert and unprepossessing physicality are as evocative as the rhythmic and sensorial experience of Estha's haunted memories. The insights garnered from metaphors, irony, repetition, and asides give depth and poignancy to characters that would otherwise remain flat figures in a strange land. Overall, the authors' masterful use of literary technique brings Quoyle and Estha to life.
