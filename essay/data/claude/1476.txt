Language, Discourse, and the Representation of Gender in "The Yellow Wallpaper"

Charlotte Perkins Gilman's short story "The Yellow Wallpaper" is a seminal work of literature that explores themes of mental illness and women's oppression in the 19th century. A key way in which the story examines patriarchal control over women is through its representation of gender through language and discourse. The unnamed female narrator is forbidden from creative expression and intellectual stimulation, as her physician husband, John, prescribes a "rest cure" to treat her "mental distress." Confined to an attic nursery, she becomes obsessed and ultimately descends into madness while staring at the room's garish yellow wallpaper.

In the story, the narrator's language and writing are closely monitored and censored by her husband, representing the control that the patriarchal society exerted over women's voices and self-expression. When the narrator wants to write in a journal to occupy her mind, John forbids it: "He says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making, a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency.” The narrator continues to write in secret, but she hides her writing and feels guilty for disobeying her husband's mandate. The "imaginative power and habit of story-making" that John condemns is representative of the creative and intellectual spirit that patriarchal society sought to suppress in women. John subscribes to a "rest cure" for his wife that requires strict bed rest and no mental stimulation, highlighting the belief that women's minds were somehow more fragile and prone to "excited fancies."

The condescending way in which John speaks to his wife further reflects the patriarchal outlook that women had inferior and feeble minds. He calls her "little girl" and "blessed little goose," downplaying her maturity and intelligence. John's belief in the "rest cure" and dismissal of his wife's mental facilities demonstrate the era's prejudices that women were incapable of rational thought and needed to be controlled for their own wellbeing. The narrator herself has clearly internalized these biases, referring to her "imaginative power" as a "tendency" and a "habit of story-making" instead of a skill or gift. The discourse around gender roles and mental illness in the story reflect the prejudices that were commonly held at the time and contributed to the oppression of women.  

The narrator's obsession with the yellow wallpaper itself also represents her internalization of patriarchal control over her voice and her mind. Trapped in the attic with no stimulation, she becomes increasingly fixated on the wallpaper, seeing a trapped woman within its pattern and coming to identify with this imprisoned figure. The wallpaper thus becomes a symbol for the constraints on women and the narrator's descent into madness represents the consequences of this oppression. As she describes, “The faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she wanted to get out.” The narrator projects her own desire for escape and intellectual freedom onto this "trapped" figure in the wallpaper.
