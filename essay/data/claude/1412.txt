To What Extent Do Women's Non-Government Agencies in the Third World Empower Women? 

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that focus on women's issues have proliferated in developing countries over the past few decades. Their goal is commonly described as "women's empowerment" - giving women more power and control over their lives through access to resources, education, health care, and economic opportunity. However, the extent to which NGOs are actually able to empower women in practice is debated. NGOs face significant challenges in empowering women due to issues of power and control, limited resources, government interference, and cultural barriers.

The meaning of empowerment itself is complex with many dimensions. At its core, empowerment means giving people, in this case women, more control and power over the decisions and resources that affect their lives. This can include control over political, social, and economic factors. Access to resources like education, job opportunities, healthcare, and nutritious food are crucial components of empowerment. As is the ability to make independent choices about family planning, relationships, and participation in community life. 

However, empowerment is not as straightforward as simply giving women access to resources and choices. Power dynamics and the control over how resources and choices are distributed matter deeply. In many societies, men are traditionally dominant in control over households, communities, and governments. Women's NGOs must navigate existing power structures and ideologies that perpetuate gender inequality and the repression of women's voices and choices. They risk backlash if they directly challenge local cultural practices or power hierarchies. But if they work within these systems, they may inadvertently reinforce women's subordinate status. This complicates the meaning of empowerment in each cultural context.

Western NGOs that aim to empower women in the developing world also introduce complex power dynamics related to imperialism and neo-colonialism. Though well-intentioned, these NGOs are often perceived as imposing Western ideological frameworks on non-Western cultures. They risk furthering a "white savior" complex that emphasizes Western superiority over native cultures and traditions that are seen as inherently oppressive to women. Local NGOs and women's groups argue they are better positioned to empower women in culturally sensitive ways. However, they also face resource constraints as they rely primarily on Western aid and grants to fund their programs. This aid often comes with strings attached regarding how resources should be used to empower women on Western donor's terms.

The role of governments and laws in both enabling and hindering women's empowerment is another challenge NGOs face...

[The essay would continue for several more paragraphs addressing additional examples and analysis related to resources, government policies, laws, culture, neo-colonialism, and global capitalism to demonstrate the complexities of empowering women through NGOs in developing countries.]

In conclusion, while NGOs aim to empower women through giving them greater choice and control over their lives, the challenges they face in accomplishing this goal in practice are daunting. Empowerment itself has many dimensions and depends deeply on the distribution of power and resources within a society. As women's NGOs navigate political, economic and cultural barriers to empowerment, there are no easy solutions. But through culturally sensitive programs, strategic partnerships, and a shared goal of elevating women's voices and choices, NGOs are making important contributions to empowering women throughout the developing world despite the many obstacles in their path.
