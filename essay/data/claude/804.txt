Drag is the resistance a vehicle experiences as it moves through air. Drag acts opposite to the direction of motion and slows the vehicle down, requiring more engine power to overcome. The amount and type of drag a vehicle experiences depends primarily on its shape and design. Streamlined, tapered designs like race cars experience less drag than boxy designs like buses. 

There are two main types of drag: pressure drag and skin friction drag. Pressure drag arises from differences in air pressure around the vehicle. As air flows around the vehicle, it separates, creating low pressure zones that pull the vehicle backwards. More rounded, streamlined shapes minimize pressure drag by reducing air turbulence and keeping the flow attached for longer. In contrast, bluff, boxy shapes like buses and trucks have high pressure drag due to their large, squared-off front profiles and abrupt changes in contour. 

Skin friction drag occurs due to the resistance between the air and the exterior surface of the vehicle. Smoother surfaces like polished metals produce less skin friction drag than rough surfaces. Surface area also contributes to skin friction drag - more surface area means more drag. Streamlined shapes minimize surface area and skin friction drag.

The total drag a vehicle experiences depends on its velocity and frontal area. Drag increases with the square of velocity, so going twice as fast results in four times as much drag. The drag coefficient accounts for a vehicleâ€™s shape and how streamlined it is, with lower coefficients indicating less drag. A coach may have a drag coefficient of 0.8 and frontal area of 8 m2, resulting in a drag force of about 640 N at 20 m/s. A race car with a drag coefficient of 0.3 and frontal area of 2 m2 experiences only 120 N of drag at the same speed.

Engineers must balance the competing goals of aesthetics and efficiency when designing vehicles. More rounded, tapered designs are more aerodynamic but not always the most visually appealing. Advancements in computer modeling have made it easier to test different designs and optimize for drag reduction before building physical models. However, scale models and wind tunnel testing are still useful to validate computational findings. 

In summary, the shape and design of a vehicle significantly impacts the drag it experiences. Streamlined, rounded designs minimize drag while boxy, bluff shapes increase drag. Reducing drag leads to greater fuel efficiency and performance - important considerations for vehicle engineers and designers. With continuous improvements in design and testing, vehicles can become even more aerodynamically efficient and environmentally friendly in the future.
