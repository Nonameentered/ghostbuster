The poems of Lawrence Ferlinghetti and M.B. Questel take markedly different approaches to manipulating language for poetic effect. Ferlinghetti's poem 'Autobiography' makes heavy use of techniques like repetition, alliteration, and surreal and absurdist imagery to convey the poet's creative journey. In contrast, Questel's poem 'Incident' employs precise and minimal language, subtle allusions, and the emphasis or omission of articles to create a sense of ambiguity and poetic poignancy. 

In 'Autobiography,' Ferlinghetti relies on repetition, alliteration and absurdist imagery to depict the whimsical and unbounded creative experience of the poet. The repetition of 'wandering' in the opening lines 'I was wandering along the street of dreams/wandering and wondering' immediately establishes a dreamy and fanciful tone. The alliteration in 'street of dreams' reinforces this effect. Surreal and absurdist imagery abounds, like 'came on a great house or was it a church/in which I wandered upstairs and downstairs/getting in deeper and deeper'. The repetition of 'upstairs and downstairs' and 'deeper and deeper' gives the sense of descending into a bizarre dreamscape, emphasizing the wandering, unbound imagination.

In contrast, Questel's 'Incident' employs minimal, precise language and subtle poetic techniques to create ambiguity and poignancy. The poem begins abruptly 'The train slows.' and describes a brief moment where 'A violin is playing/a melody I almost know' which leaves a fleeting impression on the speaker. The lack of explanation or context leaves much unsaid, requiring the reader to fill in the gaps. Moreover, Questel makes strategic use of the omission or inclusion of articles to shape meaning. The phrase 'a melody I almost know' has a very different feel from 'the melody I almost know.' 'A' suggests the tune is a particular one the speaker can't quite place, adding a layer of familiar yet ephemeral meaning. The inclusion of 'the' would convey the tune has more distinct significance. Similarly, the conclusion 'the train moves on' versus 'a train moves on' implies a sense of continuation and unresolved poetic mystery. Overall, Questel's minimalist style and selective use of poetic techniques create layers of meaning through ambiguity.

In summary, the poems 'Autobiography' by Lawrence Ferlinghetti and 'Incident' by M.B. Questel demonstrate two very different approaches to manipulating language for poetic effect. Ferlinghetti employs expressive and absurdist techniques like repetition, alliteration and surreal imagery to convey the unbounded creative journey. In contrast, Questel takes a minimalist approach, using subtle techniques like strategic articles and lack of context to create poetic ambiguity and poignancy. Both poems are excellent examples of manipulating language to shape meaning and experience in poetry.
