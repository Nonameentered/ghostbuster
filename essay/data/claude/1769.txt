Modernist literature emerged in the early 20th century as a radical break from 19th century realism. Modernist works are characterized by a rejection of traditional forms and techniques in favor of more experimental and unconventional styles. Thematically, modernist literature often explores the inner experience of life in the modern world, conveying a sense of loss, disillusionment, and a rejection of tradition. 

Formally, modernist works depart from the linear narrative structures and omniscient third-person narration that were common in realist literature. Modernist authors instead employ stream of consciousness, free verse forms, fragmented narratives, and unreliable narrators. Stream of consciousness, where the narrative follows the chaotic and associative thoughts of a character, is used by authors like James Joyce and Virginia Woolf to portray the inner experience of their protagonists. Free verse poetry breaks from traditional poetic forms and rhythms to create looser and more casual forms, as seen in the works of T.S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Fragmented narratives are non-linear, jumping between times and perspectives. Unreliable narrators, like the protagonist of Ford Madox Ford’s The Good Soldier, call narrative authority and objectivity into question.

Thematically, much modernist literature conveys a sense of disillusionment with modern civilization. World War 1 led to a loss of faith in human progress and a rejection of Enlightenment ideals of reason and order. Modernist works often portray individuals alienated and spiritually lost in the modern world. T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land is a seminal modernist poem that captures this sense of spiritual barrenness and lack of meaning following the war. Other works like Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway and F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby examine individuals attempting to find meaning and purpose in postwar society. 

Modernist literature makes heavy use of unconventional language and imagery to portray the intensity of the inner experience. Dense, allusive, and multi-lingual references are common, as in The Waste Land. Unexpected juxtapositions and non-linear associations are used instead of straightforward description. Joyce’s novel Ulysses, for example, employs stream of consciousness and a loose associative logic to connect its disparate scenes and convey the inner experience of its characters. Surreal and symbolic imagery is often used to represent the inner self.

In conclusion, modernist literature was a radical rejection of 19th century literary tradition that employed experimental forms and an unconventional style to portray disillusionment with modernity and explore new ways of representing inner experience. Breaking from realism, modernist works used stream of consciousness, free verse, fragmented narratives, and unreliable narrators. Thematically, they often conveyed a sense of loss, spiritual barrenness and alienation in the modern world. Dense, symbolic, and non-linear language was used to represent the intensity of inner life. Together, these characteristics gave modernist literature a pessimistic tone that reflected the postwar experience.
