Symbiosis refers to different organisms living closely together in a long-term relationship. There are three main categories of symbiosis: mutualism, commensalism, and parasitism. Mutualism involves cooperation between both organisms, where they both benefit from the relationship. Commensalism benefits one organism but does not affect the other. Parasitism is when one organism (the parasite) benefits at the expense of the other (the host). 

Parasites come in different forms based on their life cycle and mode of infection. Ectoparasites live on the surface of the host, such as fleas and ticks. Endoparasites live inside the host, such as tapeworms and roundworms. Parasites also have direct or indirect life cycles. Direct life cycles have a single host, where the parasite lives as larvae and matures into adults that produce eggs. Indirect life cycles require multiple hosts, often of different species. The parasite starts as larvae in an intermediate host, matures into adults in the definitive host, and reproduces to release eggs that infect new intermediate hosts.

The close relationship between parasites and their hosts affects their ability to adapt to new environments. Since parasites are reliant on their hosts, they are limited to areas where the hosts live. As hosts evolve and adapt to new ecological niches, the parasites must also adapt to continue infecting them. However, the specificity of some parasites to certain hosts can limit their ability to adapt quickly. Hosts also adapt by developing immunity against parasites that commonly infect them.

There are several ways hosts develop immunity against parasites. The first is genetic immunity, where hosts evolve genes that make them naturally resistant to a parasite. The second is acquired immunity, where the host's immune system develops antibodies against the parasite after exposure. This is common in animals with complex adaptive immune systems, like vertebrates. A third method is maternal immunity, where mothers pass antibodies to their offspring to protect them from parasites. Finally, social immunity refers to group behaviors that help limit parasite spread, such as grooming each other or avoiding contact with infected individuals.

In summary, symbiosis encompasses relationships where organisms live together, ranging from mutually beneficial to parasitic. Parasites have complex life cycles and close associations with their hosts that limit their ability to adapt to new environments. However, hosts have evolved diverse mechanisms of immunity to defend against common parasites and limit their impact. The continuous co-evolution between parasites and hosts shapes the diversity of life we see today.
