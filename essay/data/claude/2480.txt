The 3-phase induction motor is a commonly used motor in many industrial applications due to its robust and simple construction as well as its ability to self-start. However, its properties are not fully understood when operating as both a motor and generator in standalone and grid-connected environments. An experiment was conducted to analyze the performance characteristics of a 3-phase induction motor operating as a motor and generator under these different conditions.

The aims of the experiment were threefold: 1) to determine the torque-speed curves for the induction motor operating as a motor powered by a 3-phase inverter; 2) to analyze the induction generator characteristics when the rotor is mechanically driven above the synchronous speed; and 3) to evaluate the feasibility of using the induction motor as a grid-connected induction generator. 

The methods used to achieve these aims involved connecting the 3-phase induction motor to a variable frequency drive to control its speed and measure its torque as a motor. The motor was then disconnected from the drive and spun at speeds above the synchronous speed using a second motor to analyze its properties as an induction generator. Finally, the induction generator was connected to the electric grid to observe its operation as a grid-connected generator.

In the first set of tests, the induction motor was powered using a variable frequency drive and the torque and speed were measured using a dynamometer. The results showed the expected torque-speed curve for an induction motor with a breakdown torque of 150% of rated torque and a maximum speed of 1200 rpm.

In the second set of tests, the induction motor was mechanically spun at speeds of 1000-1500 rpm to analyze its characteristics as an induction generator. The results showed that the induction machine produces electrical power at a frequency proportional to the shaft speed. The voltage increases with the speed, while the current remains relatively constant. The power factor was found to be around 0.8 lagging. 

Finally, in the grid-connected tests, the induction generator was synchronized to the grid and its operation was evaluated under different loading conditions. The results showed stable voltage and frequency with changes in load, indicating its feasibility as a grid-connected induction generator. However, the reactive power consumption was found to be high due to the nature of induction generators. Additional capacitors may be needed to compensate for reactive power.

In summary, the experiment achieved its aims by determining the torque-speed curves of the induction motor, analyzing its characteristics as a standalone induction generator, and assessing its potential as a grid-connected generator. The 3-phase induction motor was shown to be able operate stably in all four modes, highlighting its versatility and usefulness in renewable energy applications.
