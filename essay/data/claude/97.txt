There are several factors to consider when determining whether alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) should be transmitted through the pantograph power collector on trains. The three main factors are efficiency of transmission, safety, and cost. 

In terms of efficiency, AC power transmission results in lower power losses over long distances compared to DC transmission. This is because AC power can utilize transformers to step up the voltage, which reduces the current and therefore reduces power losses according to the formula Power (P) = Current (I) x Voltage (V). The higher voltage AC power can then be stepped down again for use. While conversion between AC and DC is possible, it results in some energy losses. So for very long distance power transmission where efficiency is most important, AC is often preferred.

However, for the distances typically involved in powering trains via pantographs, the efficiency differences between AC and DC are minor. More important for trains are the safety and cost factors. DC power is generally safer since there is no alternating voltage and current, reducing the risks of electrocution. The lower voltage DC power used in trains also reduces risks to operators and passengers. DC power systems are often less expensive to install and maintain compared to AC systems as they do not require components like transformers. So for most train applications, DC power is preferred through the pantograph.

The resistivity of the conductor material used in the pantograph wiring impacts the cross-sectional area needed to effectively transmit the power. Materials with higher resistivity will require larger cross-sectional areas to overcome the greater resistance for the same power transmission. The most common materials used are copper and aluminum due to their high conductivity and low cost. Copper has lower resistivity so can use slightly smaller cross-sectional areas, but aluminum is lighter, more abundant, and less expensive. The shape of the wiring can also be optimized, with round wires providing the most efficient use of the cross-sectional area and materials. Flat strips or rectangular bars may be easier to install and join, but are not the most materials-efficient shape.

To limit corrosion and require less maintenance, the best approach is to use high-quality, weather-resistant materials that can withstand environmental exposure without significant degradation over time. At the point where wires are joined, these connections are the most susceptible to corrosion and power losses. Brazing or welding the connections to fuse the metals together helps prevent moisture from intruding. Protecting the connections in sealed terminals or with weatherproof sealants adds another layer of defense. Regular inspections of the pantograph wiring and connections can also help identify any needed cleaning or repairs to limit power losses and ensure continued safe operation.

In summary, the choice between AC and DC power transmission in the pantograph depends most on the safety, cost, and efficiency needs of the particular train application. Resistivity of the conductor materials used must also be considered to size the wiring appropriately and minimize losses. Corrosion prevention through high-quality components, protected connections, and regular inspections helps improve reliability and reduce long-term costs. Both AC and DC systems can work well, but DC is typically better suited and more commonly used for train power transmission through the pantograph.
