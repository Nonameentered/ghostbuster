Do Women Visit the Doctor More Frequently Than Men?

There is significant evidence to suggest that women, on average, visit doctors and use health care services more frequently than men. Several factors likely contribute to this observed difference.

First, women generally live longer than men and face higher risk and incidence of certain chronic diseases that require ongoing medical monitoring and treatment. For example, women have higher lifetime risks of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis, conditions that often prompt regular doctor visits. Women are also more prone to autoimmune disorders like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus that can involve frequent specialist care. As people age, the number of doctor visits typically increases for the management of any chronic health issues. So, the greater longevity and incidence of some chronic diseases among women contributes to their higher rate of doctor visits over a lifetime.

Second, women are more likely to obtain regular preventive care like cancer screenings, vaccinations, and checkups. According to the CDC, women are more likely than men to get recommended preventive services such as mammograms, Pap tests, flu shots, and osteoporosis screenings. These types of routine preventive care naturally result in more frequent visits to physicians. Men, on the other hand, are less likely to get routine physical exams and preventive care, so they tend to only see the doctor for acute health issues or when they get seriously ill. This difference in healthcare-seeking behavior and views on the importance of prevention contributes to the gender difference in doctor visits.   

Finally, biological factors including pregnancy, childbirth, and reproductive care lead women to utilize health services more often than men. Prenatal care, postnatal care, birth control management, and other reproductive health needs prompt women to see their OBGYN, primary doctor, or health clinic on a regular basis. Men do not have equivalent biological drivers of healthcare use.

In summary, while there are certainly exceptions, women on average visit the doctor more frequently than men over a lifetime. A combination of longer life expectancy, higher incidence of some chronic diseases, greater use of preventive care services, and reproductive health needs contribute to this observed gender difference in medical visit rates and healthcare utilization. Of course, there is variation among individuals, but these factors likely explain the overall population-level difference.
