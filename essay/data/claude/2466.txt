There are several key criteria that can be used to evaluate domestic bread makers. These include performance, safety, design, and cost. The performance of a bread maker refers to how well it bakes bread and the quality of the end result. Important factors include the variety of settings, ability to make different styles of bread, consistency of results, and taste and texture of the bread. 

For performance, the Zojirushi BB-PAC20 Home Bakery Virtuoso Breadmaker is a top-rated model. It offers multiple settings for making basic breads, artisan breads, gluten-free bread, dough, cakes, and pasta. It produces very consistent results with lightly browned, crispy crusts and moist, airy crumbs. However, at over $300, it is a more expensive machine. The Oster 2-Pound Expressbake Bread Maker is a more affordable option under $70. While it lacks some of the settings and features of the Zojirushi, thousands of reviewers praise it for making light, fluffy bread and call it a great value for the price. 

Safety refers to the materials used, automatic shutoff features, cord management, and ease of cleaning. The Zojirushi uses BPA-free plastics and stainless steel, has a power interruption protection feature, and all parts that touch food are dishwasher safe. The Oster Bread Maker also uses BPA-free materials but lacks an automatic shutoff and cord storage. It does have an easy-to-clean nonstick baking pan, but some parts are not immersible and require hand washing. 

The design considers size, display and controls, viewing window, quality of construction, and aesthetics. The Zojirushi has a sleek stainless steel exterior, large LCD display, intuitive push-button controls, and a large viewing window. However, it is quite heavy and bulky. The Oster has a more basic design with manual dial controls and a smaller viewing window. It is lighter but the materials feel more cheaply made.

In summary, for performance, the Zojirushi Virtuoso Breadmaker excels but at a high cost. For budget-friendly bread making, the Oster 2-Pound Expressbake is a good choice despite some design and safety drawbacks. No machine is perfect, so determining how much you plan to use it and which factors are most important will help choose the best bread maker for your needs. When evaluating models, consider your priorities and how well the different options can deliver on performance, safety, design, and cost.
