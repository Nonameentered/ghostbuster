Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the median nerve in the wrist becomes compressed. The median nerve runs through the carpal tunnel, a narrow passageway in the wrist formed by small wrist bones and a stiff band of tissue called the transverse carpal ligament. When the tendons in the carpal tunnel become swollen or inflamed, they can compress the median nerve, causing carpal tunnel syndrome.

Patients with carpal tunnel syndrome typically experience numbness, tingling, and pain in the wrist, hand, and fingers. The diagnostic process begins with a physical exam, during which a doctor will evaluate symptoms, test wrist and hand strength and sensation, and may gently tap or press on the median nerve to see if it elicits symptoms. If carpal tunnel syndrome is suspected, the doctor will usually order electrodiagnostic tests such as a nerve conduction study and electromyography. These tests use small electrical impulses to measure how well the median nerve is functioning. They can confirm if the nerve is being compressed.

In severe or persistent cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, surgery to relieve pressure on the median nerve may be recommended. The most common procedure is called carpal tunnel release, in which the transverse carpal ligament is cut to open up the carpal tunnel space and relieve pressure. Without treatment, the compression of the median nerve can lead to muscle weakness and permanent nerve damage. Left untreated, carpal tunnel syndrome can cause impaired hand function, including loss of hand dexterity and strength. Untreated syndrome can even lead to atrophy of muscles at the base of the thumb.  

Prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome is important to avoid long-term complications. Carpal tunnel release surgery has a high success rate of relieving or reducing symptoms when performed before irreversible nerve damage has occurred. With treatment, most patients experience significant reduction of symptoms and are able to return to normal daily activities and work duties.
