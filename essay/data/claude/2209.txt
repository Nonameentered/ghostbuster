Here is a 3,250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Marks & Spencer (M&S) was once a dominant force in the UK retail industry. However, by the late 1990s the company had experienced a significant downturn in performance and faced major issues with its business model and corporate culture. There are several internal factors that contributed to the company's struggles in the late 1990s. 

One of the most significant internal issues was that M&S had an outdated and inflexible business model that failed to adapt to changes in the retail market and consumer preferences. M&S was known for selling high-quality, staple items of clothing at reasonable prices, catering to a mainstream market. However, by the 1990s consumers had developed an appetite for more fashionable and trend-led clothing. M&S was slow to respond to this shift and stuck rigidly to its traditional business model of classic and conservative clothing, even as it was losing customers to retailers offering more fashionable and competitive options. M&S also failed to develop a successful plan to create an online sales channel, lagging far behind competitors in e-commerce. The company's unwillingness to evolve and update its business model to match major trends in the retail market was a major factor in its declining performance.

Another key problem was that M&S had developed an inward-looking and complacent corporate culture that lacked innovation and a customer focus. The company had been so dominant for so long that it failed to anticipate and respond to the rising threat of competitors. There were few channels for new ideas and little incentive for managers and executives to take risks. Decision making was slow and bureaucratic. The company had lost touch with its customers and the outside market. This stagnant and complacent culture prevented M&S from making the bold changes needed to turn around its performance.

In conclusion, Marks & Spencer struggled in the late 1990s due to several major internal issues, including an outdated business model, a stagnant corporate culture, supply chain problems, and ineffective marketing. These factors contributed to a significant decline in sales and profits, despite M&Sâ€™s previous market dominance and loyal customer base. To revitalize the company, major changes were needed across its business model, organizational culture, and operations. By the early 2000s, under new leadership, M&S began to implement sweeping modernization efforts to overcome these internal issues, ultimately returning the company to growth and success.
