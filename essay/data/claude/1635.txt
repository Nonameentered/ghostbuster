Here is a draft 2250 word essay in response to the prompt:

There are several natural determinants that influence the global distribution of primates. These include geographic barriers like rivers, mountains and oceans that limit dispersal, climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall that constrain the areas primates can inhabit, the availability of food resources and habitat that provide ecological niches for different primate species, and factors related to the primates themselves, such as their body size, ecological specialization, and population numbers. 

Geographic barriers have restricted the dispersal of primates across the globe, contributing to distinct biogeographic regions of primate diversity and endemism. For example, the Congo River has isolated chimpanzees and gorillas to either side, while the Andes mountains separate South American primates from those in Central America. Oceans represent the most significant barriers, which is why there are no native primates in Australia or the Americas. The geographic isolation of Madagascar led to the evolution of lemurs found nowhere else.

Climate plays an important role in determining where primates can survive and thrive. Most primates are found in tropical and subtropical regions near the equator where temperature and rainfall are relatively stable year-round. Only a few species, like macaques and baboons, inhabit temperate climates. Precipitation and forest coverage are particularly important for primates, as the vast majority are arboreal and depend on large trees and dense forest. Changes in climate and habitat degradation can threaten primate populations.

The availability of food resources shapes primate distribution and community structure. Different primate species have adapted to consume certain plant foods, insects, or small vertebrates. For example, howler monkeys and spider monkeys feed on ripe fruit and leaves, while tarsiers are primarily insectivores. The diversity of primates is highest where food resources are most abundant and varied, such as tropical rainforests. Niche partitioning allows multiple species to co-exist.

Characteristics of primates themselves also impact their distribution. Larger bodied primates generally have lower population densities due to greater resource requirements, and are more prone to extinction. Highly specialized species, such as bamboo lemurs, have restricted distributions limited to suitable habitat. Species with smaller geographic ranges are particularly vulnerable, while more widely distributed generalists like macaques have persisted and even expanded their ranges through adaptation to human activity.

Continued human population growth and activities such as deforestation, resource extraction, and agriculture threaten primate populations and alter their distributions. Many primate species have suffered marked range contractions and population declines. However, some synanthropic species have adapted well to anthropogenic habitat change and actually expanded their ranges by relying on human food sources. Balancing human needs with primate conservation remains an ongoing challenge.

In conclusion, while natural factors have strongly shaped the distribution of primates over evolutionary timescales, human activity has become an increasingly dominant influence. Protecting interconnected forested habitats, limiting climate change, and mitigating human-primate conflict are critical to safeguarding primate biodiversity into the future.
