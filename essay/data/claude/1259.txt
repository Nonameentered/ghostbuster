To convert the Friog Quarry site into a public area for leisure activities, several measures would need to be taken to make the space safe, accessible, and appropriate for public use. First, safety measures are essential before opening the site to the public. The quarry walls and surfaces would need to be assessed for rockfalls and unstable areas. At-risk areas would require stabilization, fencing, or clearing to reduce risks to the public. Proper lighting and emergency facilities would also need to be installed.  

Second, the site must have adequate accessibility for public visitors. This would require installation of a perimeter fence with entrance gates, clearly marked trails, and potentially parking areas if visitors drive to the location. The terrain is likely rugged after years of quarry operations, so pathways would need to be graded and paved to allow access for people of all abilities. Guardrails may also need to be erected in some areas for visitor safety.

Finally, facilities and activities suited to public leisure and recreation would need to be developed. This could include amenities like benches, picnic tables, playgrounds or sports areas. The Quarry lake at the center of the site may be suitable for recreational boating or fishing if properly cleaned and tested. The unique geology of the quarry also provides an opportunity for educational facilities if there is public interest. Signage and information about the natural and mining history of the location could enhance the visitor experience.  

The purpose of the March 2005 investigation at the Friog Quarry was likely to assess the feasibility and requirements of converting the disused quarry into a public recreational site. The investigators probably surveyed the area to evaluate potential hazards, access points, physical terrain challenges, and suitable locations for recreational facilities. The investigation report would determine if converting the quarry for public access and leisure activities is practical, outline recommendations to address any issues, and provide estimated costs to implement the proposals and open the site for recreational use. In summary, the investigators aimed to evaluate if the proposed site conversion aligned with the land use and community goals while ensuring public safety.
