Here is a 1000 word essay in response to the prompt:

Speech act theory refers to the idea that when we speak, we are performing acts such as requesting, promising, greeting, warning, inviting, and so on. These acts are known as speech acts. The theory was developed by philosophers like J.L. Austin and John Searle to analyze not just what is said but what is achieved by saying it. 

According to speech act theory, each speech act consists of three components: the locutionary act, the illocutionary act, and the perlocutionary act. The locutionary act refers to the literal meaning of the words used. For example, the sentence “I will clean my room” has the locutionary act of conveying the meaning of the words to clean and room. The illocutionary act conveys the speaker's intention, such as promising, warning, inviting, etc. In this case, the illocutionary act is that of promising. The perlocutionary act refers to the effect of the speech act, such as convincing, persuading, frightening, or annoying. Here, the perlocutionary act could be to reassure the listener.

For speech acts to be felicitous or successful, certain felicity conditions must be met. These include: 1) there must be a conventional procedure in place, 2) the relevant participants must have certain thoughts, feelings, and intentions, 3) the context must be appropriate. For a promise, the procedure is a promise, the participants intend to promise and be promised to, and the context suggests a promise is relevant.

Conversational implicatures refer to implied meanings in conversation. They follow certain maxims of cooperation, including: 1) maxims of quantity (provide enough information), 2) maxims of quality (be truthful), 3) maxim of relation (be relevant), and 4) maxim of manner (be clear and orderly). These implicatures and maxims intersect with and augment speech acts. For example, a warning could implicate concern for the listener's wellbeing based on the cooperativeness conditions.

Politeness strategies, such as positive/negative politeness, also connect to speech acts by influencing how the acts are performed. For example, positive politeness (emphasis on agreement and inclusiveness) can be used to perform an invitation, while negative politeness (emphasis on restraint and formality) can be used to perform a request. The choice of strategy depends on social factors like power dynamics and culture.

In summary, speech act theory provides a framework for analyzing communicative acts in conversation beyond a focus on literal meaning. The locutionary, illocutionary, and perlocutionary acts attribute multiple layers of meaning and effect to utterances. The felicity conditions, maxims and implicatures, and politeness strategies further shape how those speech acts are executed and understood based on context. Together, these concepts paint a comprehensive picture of communication in conversation.
