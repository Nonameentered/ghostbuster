Investors have several important factors to consider when monitoring a company's performance both before and after investing in it. Four key areas investors should evaluate are: 1) the Weighted Cost of Capital which determines a company's risk and required rate of return; 2) Free Cash Flow which shows how much cash the company is generating from operations; 3) policies on international finance which indicate the company's global positioning and risk diversification; and 4) policies on environmental issues which reflect the company's sustainability and long term impact.   

Using Centrica Plc as a case study, we can analyze these four areas to evaluate the company's performance and provide recommendations for shareholders. Centrica is a British multinational energy and services company, the largest supplier of gas to the British domestic market.

Centrica's Weighted Cost of Capital (WACC) is currently 6.1% which is relatively low, indicating the company is in a stable financial position with low risk. This low required return means Centrica does not have to generate very high profits to satisfy investors. However, this WACC has been increasing over the past few years, suggesting Centrica's risk profile is rising. Shareholders should monitor Centrica's WACC to ensure it does not increase too quickly which would make it difficult for Centrica to meet investor's return expectations.

In terms of Free Cash Flow (FCF), Centrica generated Â£904 million in operating FCF in 2018, a 36% increase from 2017 which is a positive sign. Strong FCF indicates Centrica is producing ample cash to fund its business operations and investments for future growth without needing to raise additional capital. Shareholders should track Centrica's FCF to confirm the company remains consistently cash flow positive, and check that the cash is being used productively e.g. to pay down debt or fund strategic projects.  

Regarding international finance, Centrica operates in multiple countries across Europe and North America. While this diversifies risk, it also introduces currency risk as Centrica reports in British Pounds but earns revenue in other currencies. Shareholders should monitor Centrica's hedging policies and currency exposure, especially given the uncertainty around Brexit, to ensure exchange rate fluctuations do not negatively impact Centrica's profits. There is also country risk from political and economic instability in some markets Centrica operates in e.g. Argentina.

Finally, Centrica's environmental policies aim for the company to become carbon neutral by 2050. Shareholders should evaluate Centrica's progress against key environmental KPIs and targets to confirm the company is acting sustainably long term. For example, Centrica's carbon intensity has declined ~36% since 2009 but the rate of reduction seems to be slowing. Shareholders may want to put pressure on Centrica to accelerate its environmental initiatives.

In summary, shareholders should regularly monitor Centrica's WACC, FCF, international finance policies, and environmental policies to determine the company's current performance and make recommendations. Centrica appears in a reasonably strong position currently based on its low WACC and solid FCF. However, shareholders should watch for any worsening in Centrica's risk profile reflected by a rising WACC, check that FCF remains positive and well utilized, ensure currency and country risks are properly managed, and continue encouraging faster progress on environmental goals. Overall, active monitoring and recommendations can help safeguard shareholder value.
