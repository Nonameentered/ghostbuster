Manydown estate's approach to farming is focused on diversification, sustainability, and profitability. Their mission statement emphasizes utilizing their natural resources in an "integrated, environmentally sustainable and commercially successful manner." To achieve this mission, Manydown operates several distinct agricultural enterprises that work together to maximize efficiency and profit.  

The core enterprise at Manydown is their flock of over 2000 sheep. The sheep provide wool that is sold to textile manufacturers as well as lambs that are sold for meat. The sheep graze on Manydown's pastures, making use of their abundant grassland resources. The sheep provide an important source of income through the sale of wool, lamb, and mutton. The sheep also play a role in maintaining the health of the pastures through controlled grazing. By rotating the sheep through different pastures, they ensure the grass is not overgrazed. The sheep enterprise is a key part of Manydown's sustainable and integrated approach.

In addition to sheep, Manydown also operates a herd of over 200 beef cattle. Like the sheep, the cattle graze on rotational pastures and provide income through the sale of beef. However, cattle also provide manure which Manydown composts and uses as fertilizer on their pastures and cropland. By using the manure as fertilizer, Manydown reduces their need for synthetic fertilizers and helps close the loop in their nutrient cycle. The cattle, like the sheep, help sustainably maximize the use of their grassland resources.

While livestock plays an important role, Manydown also has significant cropland where they grow wheat, barley, oilseed rape, and linseed. These crops provide income through their sale to food producers and biofuel manufacturers. The crops also provide straw which is used as bedding for their sheep and cattle. The rotation of these crops helps naturally fertilize the soil. Growing a diversity of crops helps Manydown minimize risk and capitalize on market opportunities. The crops provide an important income source and help complete Manydown's integrated system.  

In summary, Manydown achieves their mission through the integrated operation of multiple agricultural enterprises including sheep, cattle, and cropland. The enterprises provide income through the sale of wool, lamb, beef, and crops. More than just providing income, the enterprises work together sustainably by facilitating the rotation of animals and crops to maximize nutrition and soil health. This diversified yet integrated approach to farming is key to Manydown's profitability and environmental sustainability. Overall, the mission statement is achieved through diversity, integration, and a commitment to sustainable practices.
