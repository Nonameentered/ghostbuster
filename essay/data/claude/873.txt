There were several factors that contributed to the emergence of African slavery in the North American colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries. Two of the most significant factors were economic concerns regarding the demand for labor and the rise of racial ideologies that facilitated the justification and expansion of race-based slavery. The debate between the relative importance of economic factors versus racial politics has shaped historians' interpretations of how and why slavery developed in the New World. 

On the economic side, there was a high demand for labor in the colonies, especially in agricultural regions focused on labor-intensive crops like tobacco, rice, indigo, and later cotton. The supply of indentured servants from England and elsewhere in Europe was insufficient to meet these labor demands. At the same time, the transatlantic slave trade was making it increasingly possible to import large numbers of Africans to the colonies. Enslaving Africans was a way to resolve the labor shortage and reduce production costs. Some historians argue that economic imperatives were the primary driving factor behind the growth of slavery.

However, racial ideologies also played a key role. Many colonists developed beliefs that Africans were inferior and best suited for slavery, a savage people who could be justly dominated and exploited. Racist beliefs were used to rationalize and justify the brutal system of chattel slavery. Laws and social norms increasingly defined slavery as a hereditary and permanent condition tied to race. The children of enslaved women were also slaves, born into slavery. Racial distinctions made it easy to identify who could be enslaved. Over time, slavery became an exclusively racial institution focused on Africans and African Americans.

The debate between economic and racial explanations has been at the heart of scholarly controversies about the rise of slavery. Some historians like Edmund Morgan stressed economic motives and downplayed racism. Others like Winthrop Jordan focused more on the power of racial prejudices. Most modern historians recognize that both race and economics were crucial to the development of slavery in the colonial era. Economic concerns drove the initial demand for slave labor, but racial ideologies enabled the system of slavery to become cemented and explicitly tied to race.

In conclusion, the emergence of slavery in the colonies was the result of a combination of factors - the economic need for labor, the availability of the transatlantic slave trade, and the rise of racial beliefs that Africans were inferior and ideally suited to slavery. These forces reinforced each other and led to the establishment of a system of chattel slavery that would shape labor, politics, and society in the colonies for generations. The debate over the relative weight of economic motives and racial ideologies provides valuable insight into the complex origins of such a pivotal institution.
