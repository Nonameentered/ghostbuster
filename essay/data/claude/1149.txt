Assess the objectivity of historical accounts of Spartans focusing on Agesilaos, analyzing and comparing the works of Xenophon and Plutarch.  

The ancient Spartans have long captured the imaginations of historians and readers, with their militaristic society, austere lifestyle, and stalwart defense of Greece against the Persians. Two of the most prominent ancient writers who described the Spartans were Xenophon and Plutarch, both of whom wrote accounts mentioning the Spartan king Agesilaos II. However, the degree of objectivity in these historical accounts is debatable, as both authors had their own motivations and perspectives.

Xenophon was a contemporary of Agesilaos who lived in the 4th century BCE. He was an Athenian mercenary, student of Socrates, and relied on Agesilaos for military assignments and patronage at points in his life. In his Hellenica, Xenophon relates Agesilaos’ campaign into Persia against Artaxerxes II in 396 BCE. Xenophon’s account is highly complimentary, depicting Agesilaos as a gracious, virtuous, and courageous leader. For example, Xenophon writes that Agesilaos “desired glory and honour, not gain,” and heaped “praise and honour upon his friends according to the worth of each.” While Xenophon’s proximity to the events gives his account authority, his reliance on Agesilaos also introduces biases that call into question his objectivity. Xenophon had motivation to portray Agesilaos in a positive light to maintain his favor. 

In contrast, Plutarch wrote his biography of Agesilaos around 100 CE, over 400 years after Xenophon. As a  biographer, Plutarch strove to capture the moral character of his subjects. In his Life of Agesilaos, Plutarch acknowledges Xenophon’s account but also introduces sources that are more critical of Agesilaos, such as the Theban leader Epaminondas. Plutarch relates that Epaminondas regarded Agesilaos as “proud, vain-glorious, and cowardly.” Plutarch also criticizes Agesilaos himself for being too fond of boys, spoiling his son Archidamus, and being harsh to his son-in-law. While more objective than Xenophon in incorporating critical perspectives, Plutarch still aims to distill Agesilaos’ life into moral lessons for his readers. His account is not impartial history but crafted to achieve his own didactic purposes.  

In conclusion, while Xenophon and Plutarch provide two of the most detailed accounts of Agesilaos’ reign, both have limitations in their objectivity stemming from their personal circumstances and literary aims. Xenophon’s proximity to events gives authenticity but also bias from his reliance on Agesilaos’ patronage. Plutarch aims more for moral education than impartial history. A fully objective account of Agesilaos is elusive. By analyzing Xenophon and Plutarch together, however, we can get a fuller picture of this enigmatic Spartan king by balancing the perspectives of his contemporary advocate with those of his posthumous critic.
