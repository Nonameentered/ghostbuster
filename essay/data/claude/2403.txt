The Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic in the UK, also known as “mad cow disease,” refers to the outbreak of a fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting cattle that began in 1984 and peaked in 1992-1993. BSE is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy caused by prions that leads to a fatal degeneration of the brain and spinal cord. The BSE epidemic caused a major crisis in the UK due to its significant consequences on human health, the economy and trade, and consumer confidence.  

Epidemiologically, the initial cases of BSE were detected in dairy cows in 1984. The disease spread very rapidly, with over 100,000 cattle affected by 1992. The main mode of transmission turned out to be the inclusion of meat and bone meal (MBM) made from infected cattle in feed for other cattle. This recycling of bovine tissues back to cattle was common practice to provide cheap protein, but it amplified the BSE prions in the cattle population. The epidemic finally peaked in 1993, and controlling measures such as banning MBM from cattle feed brought the epidemic under control by 1996-1997. However, by this time, the damage to consumer confidence and the economy had already been devastating.

Human health was also severely affected due to the emergence of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) around 1995, a fatal neurodegenerative disease in humans that was causally linked to exposure to BSE prions. Epidemiological research found that the most likely route of initial infection of humans was through the food chain, especially consumption of BSE-contaminated beef products such as beefburgers, sausages, and other beef-derived materials. There were eventually 178 definite or probable deaths from vCJD in the UK linked to the BSE epidemic. This led to widespread fear of the safety of British beef and a ban on British beef exports that lasted for over a decade.

The government's slow initial response and policies that amplified the spread of the disease led to heavy criticism. The government insisted throughout the 1980s that British beef was perfectly safe to eat. It was not until 1996 that the government admitted there was a link between BSE and the occurrence of vCJD in humans. By this time, millions of infected cattle had entered the human food chain, and Britain had already imposed a ban on the export of beef from infected herds. The government's slow action and initial denials seriously damaged consumer confidence in the safety of British beef.

The BSE crisis had a severe economic impact, especially for the agricultural industry. The costs to the public sector arising from the BSE crisis amounted to over £5 billion. The costs to the beef and dairy industry were estimated to be around £3.7 billion.  Many beef and dairy farmers went out of business. The ban on British beef also closed export markets, costing the industry £4 billion per year at the height of the crisis. Surveys found that up to 50% of consumers stopped eating beef for some time, demonstrating a huge loss in consumer confidence.

In conclusion, the BSE epidemic in the UK resulted in a major crisis with devastating consequences, especially due to its impacts on human health, the economy and trade. The crisis demonstrated the importance of early detection, transparency in risk communication, and trust between policymakers, scientists, the agricultural industry and the public in effectively managing issues around food safety.
