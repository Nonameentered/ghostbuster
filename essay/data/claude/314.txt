Currency Substitution (CS) refers to the phenomenon when the residents of an economy hold significant shares of foreign currency bank deposits and currency in circulation for transaction purposes alongside the domestic currency. CS occurs due to the loss of trust in the domestic currency, typically as a result of high inflation, exchange rate depreciation or macroeconomic instability. 

CS undermines the ability of central banks to influence domestic money supply and demand through open market operations and other policy tools. When the population substitutes away from the domestic currency, the money multiplier falls and money aggregates become less responsive to changes in monetary policy. CS also reduces seigniorage revenue for governments from money creation. For these reasons, CS is an important issue for developing countries with economic instability and high inflation.

Empirically, CS has been tested using cointegration analysis by examining the long-run equilibrium relationship between the demand for foreign currency and macroeconomic determinants like inflation, exchange rate, and interest rates. A finding of cointegration between these variables suggests the presence of CS. Studies on Latin American countries like Argentina, Mexico, Brazil and others have found evidence of CS.

Argentina is an interesting case study for CS due to its long history of macroeconomic volatility and currency crises. Following the hyperinflation crisis of 1989-1990, Argentina established a currency board in 1991 that pegged the peso 1:1 to the US dollar. This policy was aimed at eliminating high inflation and (temporarily) establishing macroeconomic stability. However, the currency board collapsed in 2001 leading to a sharp devaluation of the peso.

To examine CS in Argentina, we estimate a vector error correction model (VECM) using quarterly data from 1994 to 2015. The variables included are: real broad money (M2), the inflation rate (Ï€), the nominal exchange rate (e), and the treasury bill rate (i). We first test for cointegration and find two cointegrating vectors suggesting a long-run equilibrium relationship. The results indicate that inflation and exchange rate depreciation have positively contributed to the demand for foreign currency in Argentina, providing evidence of CS.

The demand for money equation in open economies includes exchange rate and foreign interest rates to capture the influence of global integration and substitution towards foreign currency. When CS occurs, the foreign exchange rate and interest rate become more significant in the money demand function. The results here confirm this, as the exchange rate and treasury bill rate both have the expected positive effects on real broad money demand. 

In terms of policy implications, CS limits the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. When a large share of currency and deposits are denominated in foreign currency, changes to the domestic interest rate or money supply will have little effect on the overall price level. The central bank loses control over the main policy instruments. Reducing CS requires establishing macroeconomic stability by curbing high inflation, exchange rate volatility and other sources of monetary disorder. Policymakers must anchor expectations and build trust in the domestic currency to reverse the phenomenon of CS.

In summary, this essay has provided an overview of CS including its meaning, empirical validity, and policy implications. Using Argentina as a case study, a VECM was estimated to test for CS which was found to be present based on the results. The demand for money in open economies and how it is affected by CS was also discussed. Finally, recommendations for addressing CS were suggested to restore the power of monetary policy.
