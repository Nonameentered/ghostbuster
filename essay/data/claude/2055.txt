There is an ongoing debate regarding the extent to which Middle Palaeolithic Neanderthals employed hunting versus scavenging to obtain food. Evaluating the subsistence strategies of Neanderthals during this period is challenging given the loss and disturbance of archaeological material over time, as well as difficulties distinguishing human versus carnivore activity at sites. However, based on available evidence from open-air sites and rock shelters across Europe, it appears Neanderthals at this time engaged in a mix of both hunting and scavenging, with a gradual increase in hunting over time linked to climatic changes and shifts in available fauna.  

At the open-air site of Il'Skaja in the Northern Caucasus around 90,000-60,000 years ago, the skeletal remains of large mammals such as rhino, red deer, wild boar, and tortoise suggest Neanderthals both hunted and scavenged. The presence of complete or nearly complete skeletons points to scavenging of natural deaths, while cut marks on some bones indicate hunting and butchery. Similarly, at the open site of Mauren in Belgium around 70,000 years ago, a mix of large mammal remains with some cut marks suggests a combination of scavenging and hunting by Neanderthals.

Evidence from several rock shelter sites also supports a mix of subsistence strategies. At Combe Grenal in France around 90,000 years ago, faunal remains dominated by reindeer suggest Neanderthals hunted locally available prey. However, presence of cave bear remains points to opportunistic scavenging. At Guattari Cave in Italy around 60,000-40,000 years ago, a diversity of fauna including deer, wild boar, horse, and rhino were present, with cut marks indicating hunting. But presence of cave bear and carnivores indicates scavenging of natural deaths and leftover prey was also occurring.

Over time, there appears to have been a gradual shift toward increased hunting, linked to major climatic and environmental changes in the Middle Palaeolithic. The glacial period starting around 70,000 years ago led to changes in vegetation and the animals available to Neanderthals, requiring adaptation to new prey like reindeer. Developing more advanced hunting techniques and weapons, as well as group cooperation, allowed Neanderthals to actively hunt prey rather than rely on scavenging. Evidence for projectile points and traps suggest greater planning depth. 

In summary, while preservation issues and other challenges complicate subsistence evaluation, combining evidence from multiple sites provides insight into Neanderthal food acquisition strategies. During much of the Middle Palaeolithic, Neanderthals employed a mix of both hunting and scavenging large prey to ensure adequate nutrition. However, increasing hunting of locally available fauna over time, driven by a cooling climate and shifts in prey ecology, points to adaptation in Neanderthal behavior and more complex social organization. Rather than a dichotomy of hunting versus scavenging, Neanderthals flexibly engaged in both strategies as environmental conditions demanded. Overall, while scavenging opportunities were exploited when available, gradually improved hunting abilities allowed Neanderthals to actively pursue prey to form the mainstay of their subsistence.
