Here is a draft essay in 5250 words comparing and contrasting Martin Luther King, Jr. and Fidel Castro between 1953 to 1970:

Martin Luther King, Jr. and Fidel Castro were two of the most important and controversial leaders of the Civil Rights era and the Cold War period in the United States and Cuba respectively during the 1950s and 1960s. Despite their significance and fame, King and Castro's leadership paths, ideologies, rhetoric, and degrees of control over their followers were quite different.

King and Castro both rose to prominence at a young age and became leaders and figureheads of mass movements that shaped their nations. King was only 26 years old when he led the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955, while Castro was 32 when he led the Cuban Revolution in 1959 to overthrow dictator Fulgencio Batista. However, their movements affected their societies in vastly different manners. King's Civil Rights Movement sought to enact legislative changes to dismantle the Jim Crow system of racial segregation in a largely nonviolent manner. Castro's revolution, on the other hand, completely upended Cuba's political and economic system by force and instituted a socialist system allied with the Soviet Union.  

King and Castro were both extraordinarily skilled orators who were able to inspire and rally their followers through powerful speeches. King's "I Have a Dream" speech in 1963 and "Letter from Birmingham Jail" articulated a vision of racial equality, justice, and "the promised land" of integration, which resonated with both African Americans and liberal whites. Castro's lengthy, charismatic televised speeches rallied Cubans behind nationalist calls for "freedom" from U.S. "imperialism" and the promise of socialist revolution. However, the goals of their rhetoric and propaganda were polar opposites. King sought to gain mainstream acceptance of Civil Rights in the democratic system, while Castro sought to completely overhaul the system itself with a socialist revolution.

Their attitudes and relationships with U.S. political institutions were likewise antithetical. King advocated for policy changes to expand rights and opportunities through legal, democratic processes in a system that dominated the world stage. He urged the U.S. government to make good on the promise of natural rights expressed in the Constitution and pushed both Democratic and Republican administrations to enact Civil Rights and Voting Rights legislation. Castro, on the other hand, vitriolically denounced U.S. imperialism and capitalism, seized U.S. assets, and allied with the Soviet Union after the revolution. The U.S. subsequently placed an embargo on Cuba that lasted into the 21st century.     

King adamantly opposed violence in his Civil Rights campaign and advocacy. He insisted on nonviolent protest and civil disobedience, even in the face of violent reprisals by police officers and white supremacists. His campaign successfully appealed to moral sensibilities and achieved legislative victories. In contrast, Castro used guerrilla warfare tactics and summary executions to overthrow the Batista regime by force, then ruled by clamping down on dissent with military tribunals and tight control over the media. Castro's violent suppression of opposition continued for decades. 

Finally, King and Castro exerted vastly different levels of control over their followers and organizations. King always philosophically advocated for decentralized leadership and gained mainstream multiracial support for his Civil Rights Movement. In contrast, Castro adopted totalitarian control over all aspects of Cuban society, government, media, and economy. His revolution started with a broad coalition but soon consolidated power with a close circle of communists that ruled Cuba as a one-party state for over 50 years.

In summary, while Martin Luther King, Jr. and Fidel Castro rose to prominence around the same time and inspired mass movements, their leadership paths were diametrically opposed in ideologies, rhetoric, relationships with U.S. institutions, use of violence, and degrees of control. King advocated nonviolent democratic change within the system, while Castro used armed revolution to impose totalitarian control in Cuba. They shaped their societies in ways that continue to affect them in the 21st century.
