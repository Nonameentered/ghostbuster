There are several established methods for determining the protein concentration in biological samples, each with certain advantages and disadvantages depending on the type of sample analyzed. For determining the protein concentration in different kinds of cow's milk samples (cow's milk, Soya milk, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard), three methods were used: Lowry method, formal titration method and Bradford method. Each method has strengths and weaknesses for the analysis of certain protein types, and the choice of method depends on the accuracy and appropriateness needed for a particular experiment. 

The Lowry method relies on the reaction of peptide bonds with copper and Folin reagents to form a blue complex, the concentration of which can be determined colorimetrically at 650nm. A major advantage of the Lowry method is its high sensitivity, able to detect protein concentrations as low as 5 μg/mL. However, the Lowry method can overestimate the protein content in certain samples due to possible interference from other substances that also react with the reagents. Another disadvantage is the elaborate procedure involving multiple timed reagent additions. For the analysis of cow's milk samples, the high sensitivity of the Lowry method could lead to overestimated protein values due to interfering substances in the milk. 

The formal titration method titrates peptide bonds with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), using phenolphthalein as an indicator. The end point is marked by a color change of the indicator. A main advantage of the formal titration method is its ability to provide an absolute protein concentration value without requiring a standard curve. However, it has low sensitivity, only able to detect concentrations greater than 100μg/mL. The method also requires very alkaline conditions that can denature some proteins. For the analysis of cow's milk samples, the low sensitivity of the formal titration method may not detect small changes in protein and the harsh conditions may denature milk proteins, leading to inaccurate results.

The Bradford method relies on the binding of Coomassie brilliant blue dye to protein, which causes an absorbance shift that can be measured colorimetrically at 595nm. A major advantage of the Bradford method is its speed and simplicity, with only a single reagent addition step. The Bradford method can also detect a wide range of protein concentrations with high sensitivity and is relatively less prone to interference from other substances. However, the Bradford method is less accurate in determining absolute protein values due to variations in the binding affinities of different proteins for the dye. For the analysis of cow's milk samples, the Bradford method offers a good compromise between sensitivity, speed, and robustness while still providing reasonably accurate relative protein values. 

In this experiment, the most appropriate method for determining and comparing the protein concentrations of the different cow's milk samples was the Bradford method. By constructing a standard curve using the BSA standard and measuring the absorbance of each sample, the relative protein concentrations could be determined. Several measures were taken to improve the accuracy of results. Firstly, all samples and standards were prepared in triplicate to account for any variability in the procedure. Secondly, a linearity test of the standard curve was performed to ensure it could be used to accurately determine relative protein values of the samples. Finally, the protein concentrations of samples were expressed relative to the cow's milk sample to allow for comparison between the different milk types.
