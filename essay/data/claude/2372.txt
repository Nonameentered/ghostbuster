Here is a 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Stokes drift refers to the net movement of water particles caused by surface water waves. As waves pass through the water, they cause the water particles to oscillate in circles or ellipses. Even though the particles return to their original positions as the wave crest and trough pass by, the slight asymmetry in the wave shape causes a small net drift of particles in the direction of wave propagation. This drift current arising from wave motion is known as the Stokes drift.

The Stokes drift differs from wind-driven currents in the ocean in a few key ways. Wind-driven currents, such as the large gyres in the ocean basins, are caused by the friction between the wind above the water surface and the top layer of the ocean. As the wind blows, it transfers momentum to the water below, causing water parcels to move in the direction of the wind. The Coriolis effect also causes wind-driven currents to deflect to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. In contrast, the Stokes drift is caused by the orbital motion of individual water parcels as surface waves pass by, not by the direct transfer of momentum from the wind. The Stokes drift is confined to the upper part of the wave boundary layer, typically within a few meters of the surface, while wind-driven currents extend through the full depth of the upper ocean mixed layer, which can be up to a hundred meters or more.

Computer models are instrumental for analyzing the complex motion of water in the oceans. For the Stokes drift, numerical models that solve the Navier-Stokes equations governing fluid flow can simulate the orbital motion of water particles under surface waves. By releasing virtual particles in the model at different depths, their trajectories can be calculated to determine the vertical profile and magnitude of the Stokes drift for a given wave field. These models provide insights into how the Stokes drift depends on parameters like wave height, wave period, and water depth. The results can then be compared to field measurements to validate the models.

The amplitude of the surface wave field has an important effect on the total drift in the upper ocean. As waves become larger in height, the orbital excursions of water parcels also increase, leading to a stronger Stokes drift. However, wind-driven currents are also enhanced under higher winds that generate bigger waves. So, for a fixed wind speed, an increase in wave amplitude will strengthen the Stokes drift but not the wind-driven current. On the other hand, for a fixed wave field, an increase in wind speed will intensify the wind-driven current but not the Stokes drift. By combining models for the Stokes drift and wind-driven flow, the total drift in the upper ocean can be determined for a given wave-wind scenario.

The Stokes drift and wind-driven currents represent two distinct mechanisms for moving water particles in the upper ocean. While computer models and observations have provided significant insights into how these drift components depend on factors like wind, waves, depth, and stratification individually, predicting the combined effects of waves and winds on total drift still poses challenges. Continued research is needed to fully understand the dynamics controlling upper ocean circulation and mixing.
