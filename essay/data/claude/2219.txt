Here is a 2500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Standardised Field Sobriety Tests (SFST) and Drug Recognition Examinations (DRE) are methods used by police officers to determine if a motorist's ability to drive is impaired by alcohol or drugs. The three main SFST tests are the horizontal gaze nystagmus (HGN) test, the walk-and-turn test, and the one-leg stand test. These tests are used at roadside to identify and screen motorists who may be impaired. The DRE involves a 12-step process where a trained drug recognition expert examines the motorist to determine whether their ability to drive is impaired by drugs and if so, the category of drug that is causing the impairment.

The HGN test measures involuntary eye movement to determine if a motorist's eyes are unable to smoothly follow a moving object. Consumption of certain substances like alcohol or cannabis can cause the eyes to jerk or twitch. In the walk-and-turn test, a motorist is instructed to walk heel-to-toe in a straight line, turn on one foot and return in the same manner. Impaired motorists may struggle with balance, stepping off the line or making improper turns. The one-leg stand test requires a motorist to stand on one leg with their hands by their sides while counting aloud. Impaired drivers will often sway, use their arms for balance or hop to maintain their balance. These tests are validated to identify impairment with a high degree of accuracy.

If a motorist fails the SFST, the officer may conduct a DRE or have the motorist provide a blood sample for drug screening and confirmatory testing. In a DRE, a trained examiner conducts a 12-step evaluation including checking pupil size, blood pressure and pulse. The examiner also asks a series of questions to determine the motorist’s state of mind and behaviour. The examiner uses this information to determine if the motorist’s driving is impaired by drugs and if so, the category of drug causing the impairment such as CNS Depressants, CNS Stimulants, Dissociative Anesthetics, Cannabis or Narcotic Analgesics.

Blood samples from motorists are tested using immunoassay screening tests which detect the presence of drug metabolites that indicate past drug use. The most common classes of drugs screened for include cannabis, cocaine, opioids, amphetamines and benzodiazepines. If a screening test is positive, a confirmatory test such as gas or liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry must be conducted to confirm the initial result with a high degree of accuracy and determine the concentration of drug present. The presence of drugs, even in low concentrations, can impair driving ability and lead to dangerous crashes.

In court, the results of SFST, DRE and blood drug tests provide persuasive evidence that a motorist’s driving was impaired by drugs. This often leads to convictions for driving under the influence of drugs (DUID), driving whilst unfit through drink or drugs or other related offences. The penalties for drug driving offences are similar to drink driving and can include driving bans, fines, and imprisonment depending on the laws of the jurisdiction and aggravating circumstances such as causing a crash. Some laws stipulate higher penalties for repeat offenders or where drugs and alcohol were combined.

In summary, SFST and DRE are important tools for police to screen and detect motorists driving under the influence of drugs. Blood drug tests provide confirmation of the results and evidence to support prosecutions for DUID or related offences. The most effective strategy to deter drug driving is through a combination of education, detection and enforcement of drug driving laws. Reduced drug driving will save lives by making roads safer for all users.
