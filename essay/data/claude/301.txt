The Heckscher-Ohlin model, also known as the factor proportions theory, is a theoretical trade model that explains trade patterns between countries based on their relative factor endowments. The main factors of production in the model are labor and capital. Countries that are labor-abundant will produce labor-intensive goods at lower opportunity cost, while capital-abundant countries will produce capital-intensive goods more efficiently. The Heckscher-Ohlin theory builds on David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage by incorporating differences in production technologies across countries based on their factor endowments. 

The Factor-Price Equalisation theorem states that as countries pursue free trade based on their comparative advantages in the Heckscher-Ohlin model, the prices of the factors of production (wages and capital rents) will eventually equalise across countries. As the relative prices of goods converge to the same level across countries due to trade, the returns to factors used intensively in each country's production will also converge. However, this result relies on the assumption of identical and homothetic demand conditions across countries. If demand conditions differ, full factor price equalization may not occur.

The Heckscher-Ohlin model does not assume any specific demand conditions. It focuses on the supply-side differences in factor endowments to explain trade patterns. However, the Factor-Price Equalisation theorem is dependent on demand conditions. Identical homothetic demand across countries is required for full factor price convergence. If demand for certain goods is higher in some countries, the prices and returns of factors used intensively in those industries will be bid up in those countries relative to others. Differing demand can prevent the equalization of factor prices through trade.

Factor-intensity reversal occurs when a country's comparative advantage switches from one industry to another as its factor endowments evolve over time. For example, a labor-abundant country may initially have a comparative advantage in a labor-intensive industry, but as its capital stock accumulates over time, it may gain a comparative advantage in a capital-intensive industry. With factor-intensity reversal, a country's pattern of trade flows and production specialization needs to change to reflect its new comparative advantage. The country that undergoes factor-intensity reversal will export the good that uses intensively the factor that has become relatively more abundant.

In summary, the Heckscher-Ohlin model explains trade based on differences in factor endowments across countries. The Factor-Price Equalisation theorem shows that under certain demand conditions, trade based on comparative advantages can lead to the equalization of returns to factors of production internationally. However, the model itself does not assume any specific demand conditions. Factor-intensity reversal illustrates how a country's changing factor endowments can alter its comparative advantage and trade patterns over time.
