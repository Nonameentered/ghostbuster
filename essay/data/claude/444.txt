The Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in 1532 was driven by a desire for gold, glory, and the spread of Christianity. While the initial goals of the conquest were economic and political, the justification for subjugating indigenous peoples became closely tied to evangelization and the spread of Catholicism. The role of evangelization changed over the course of the conquest from a secondary aim to a primary rationale and political tool for domination.

When Francisco Pizarro first set out to conquer the Inca Empire, his primary motivations were gold and glory. The riches of the Inca were legendary, and Pizarro sought to claim them for the Spanish crown and himself. The religious goals of the conquest, including converting souls to Christianity, were secondary. Pizarro's forces were primarily soldiers and adventurers, not missionaries.

However, as resistance to the Spanish conquest grew, evangelization became increasingly important to justify the subjugation of indigenous peoples. The Spanish argued that they had a duty to convert native peoples to save their souls. Any resistance to Spanish rule could then be portrayed as resistance to Christianity itself. Spanish violence and oppression could be rationalized as necessary to spread the true faith.

By the 1530s, the Spanish realized that a religious justification was needed to counter arguments that the conquest was unjust. Prominent Spanish thinkers like Juan Gines de Sepulveda began developing theories around the Spanish "right of conquest" over native peoples. They claimed that indigenous peoples were inherently inferior, and it was the duty of the Spanish to rule over them, by force if necessary, and convert them to Christianity. Resistance was a sign of barbarism and sin. 

With these ideological justifications in place, evangelization became a primary rationale for conquest. The Spanish took lands, enslaved native peoples, and extracted wealth all in the name of spreading the Christian faith. Churches were built atop former Inca temples, native religious practices were banned, and indigenous peoples were forcibly converted. The Spanish king granted new rights and privileges to conquerors who were particularly "devout" in spreading Christianity among native peoples.

In conclusion, evangelization transformed from a secondary goal of the Spanish conquest to a primary rationale and tool for domination. It provided a moral and political justification for violence against indigenous groups and the extraction of wealth from the Inca Empire. The spread of Christianity became the foremost duty of conquistadors and colonists, sanctifying Spanish rule in the process. Overall, evangelization allowed the Spanish to mask the true motivations behind their conquest of glory, gold, and power.
