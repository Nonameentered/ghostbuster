A structuralist analysis of Othello's monologue in Act Five, Scene Two provides insight into the protagonist's inner character and the cultural meanings embedded within the text. Structuralism examines the underlying structures that govern the organization of the monologue and shapes its meaning. By closely analyzing the language, imagery, and themes in the monologue, we can uncover Othello's anxieties over his outsider status as well as the play's critique of a social order based on strict hierarchies and binaries.

Othello begins his monologue lamenting his status as an outsider, "an erring barbarian" in the Venetian world into which he has married Desdemona. He sees himself as "an extravagant and wheeling stranger/ Of here and everywhere" who does not belong. His melancholy and loneliness are evident as he considers himself "rude" and "deficient." This establishes Othello's inner turmoil and conflict over his identity which Iago has manipulated. The repetition of "fool" further reinforces Othello's self-blame and outsider status in a culture where he does not fit in.  

The monologue also employs natural and elemental imagery that reinforce binaries between civilization and barbarism, insider and outsider. Othello sees himself as the "base Indian" throwing away a "pearl" like Desdemona. He views their relationship in the imagery of the mismatched pairing of "the flinty and steel couch of war" and "the soft and delicate" Desdemona. The oppositions here construct Othello as uncivilized and Desdemona as a refined, civilized Venetian lady. These dichotomies underscore the play's challenge of a rigid social hierarchy based on strict oppositions between barbarian and civilized.

Othello's uneasy place in Venetian society is further evident in his awkward mix of literary and military language in the monologue. References to "steep-down gulfs," "Ever-angry...flames," and "briars" mingle with military terms like " travail," "battery," "cannibally," and "hell gouts." Othello adopts a high poetic style to express deep emotions but also relies on the martial language familiar to him. This linguistic struggle parallels his difficulty navigating between soldierly masculinity and the sensitivity required for his relationship with Desdemona.

In conclusion, a structuralist analysis of Othello's monologue provides significant insight into his preoccupation with his identity as an outsider and his inability to reconcile opposites. The themes of civilization vs. barbarism and insider vs. outsider highlight the tragedy of Othello's crisis of identity in a culture characterized by strict binaries and hierarchies. The mix of literary and military language in the monologue further reflects Othello's struggle in navigating between radically different selves that ultimately proves his undoing. A close reading of the monologue using the tools of structuralism reveals the deep-seated anxieties and struggles within the protagonist and the flaws within the culture that makes his tragedy inevitable.
