The Romantic era from the late eighteenth to early nineteenth century was a period of great political, social, and cultural change in Europe, especially England. The French Revolution of 1789 and the rise of democratic reforms inspired dissent and unrest, as well as a reactionary clampdown on liberties and freedoms. The Romantic poets—especially Wordsworth and Blake—respond to this turbulent age in their poetry through a focus on individual experience, emotion, childhood, and social injustice, relating their themes to the socio-political landscape in which they lived.  

Wordsworth’s poetry centers around finding beauty and meaning through the experience of the individual. For instance, in “Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey,” Wordsworth recalls his subjective experience of walking through the Wye river valley on different occasions. The poem depicts his changing relationship to the landscape over time as he moves from a child-like exuberance to a more reflective and socially connected perspective. His emphasis on private reflection was radical in an age of empiricism and reason. But it also reflects the revolutionary spirit of valuing the individual and one’s own experience as a source of meaning. This poem, like much of Wordsworth’s work, suggests that meaning is found internally rather than by subscribing to social doctrine or convention. His poetry was revolutionary in giving so much value to solitary contemplation.  

Like Wordsworth, Blake also focuses on the individual, especially through his portrayal of children, who he sees as symbols of innocence, imagination, and authenticity. His Songs of Innocence and Experience depict the journey of the individual through this world from youth to adulthood, confronting the suffering and injustices of experience along the way. In poems like “The Chimney Sweeper” in Songs of Innocence, Blake uses the figure of the child chimney sweep to highlight the inhumane treatment of children during the Industrial Revolution—reflecting the spirit of political dissent and social reform of his era. The poem “London” also reflects the injustices of his age, highlighting the suffering of the poor and working classes in the slums and factories of the city. Through his lyric poems, Blake gives a voice to marginalized members of society like children, women, and the poor—reflecting a spirit of resistance to oppression that was also influencing the broader political culture.

In sum, Wordsworth and Blake's poetry reflects the revolutionary spirit of valuing individual experience and emotion in an age of reason and empiricism. Their poems give a voice to the voiceless, highlight social injustices of their era, and explore what it means to grow up in a turbulent world of change. Deeply attuned to their historical context, these Romantic poets created works that struck a chord during their age and continue to resonate with us today. Their timeless verse reminds us of the power of poetry to reflect upon and shape the world we live in.
