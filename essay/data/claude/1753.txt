The author examines the role of human mental ability in social and competitive situations through the lenses of cognitive development in infants, differences between typical individuals and those with autism spectrum disorders, and natural selection. 

In developing infants, assumptions about the physical world inform cognitive development. Babies as young as 2-3 months old develop an intuitive understanding of physical objects as separate, solid, and permanent things that continue to exist even when out of sight. This "core object knowledge" scaffolds learning by enabling infants to interact with and predict the behavior of objects in their environment. However, core object knowledge also introduces certain constraints, like the difficulty infants have in understanding that objects can change or be transformed. These early assumptions about physical objects thus shape both the possibilities and limitations of cognitive development in babies.

Comparing the cognitive abilities of typical individuals and those with autism spectrum disorders reveals key functions of human social intelligence. While those with autism may have enhanced perceptual and logical reasoning abilities, especially with rule-based systems, they struggle with social and emotional skills that come naturally to most people. Skills like social perception, joint attention, theory of mind, and empathy allow typical individuals to understand unspoken social cues, share experiences with others, understand different perspectives, and resonate emotionally.  These social-emotional skills, largely lacking in those with autism, play an essential role in human collaborative and competitive behavior.

Finally, natural selection offers an explanation for how human mental ability evolved to solve both social and practical problems. The complex social dynamics of group living placed evolutionary pressure on early humans to develop strong social cognition and communication abilities. At the same time, environmental challenges rewarded innovative problem-solving, learning, and adaptability. The human mind evolved to be highly flexible, gaining the ability to reconfigure knowledge and skills to suit changing circumstances. This combination of advanced social intelligence and open-ended complex reasoning has been integral to human survival, collaboration, and competition. 

In conclusion, the author explores how fundamental assumptions about the physical world influence cognitive development from infancy, how differences in cognitive abilities between neurotypical and autistic individuals reveal the importance of social intelligence, and how natural selection drove the evolution of the deeply social and adaptable human mind. Mental ability allows humans to navigate intricate social relationships and environments, solve problems collaboratively, and compete successfully against others, all while adapting to an ever-changing world.
