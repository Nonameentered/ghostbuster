The recommended amount of weight gain for pregnant women depends on their pre-pregnancy body mass index or BMI. Underweight women (BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2) should gain 28 to 40 pounds. Women of normal weight (BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2) should gain 25 to 35 pounds. Overweight women (BMI 25 to 29.9 kg/m2) should gain 15 to 25 pounds. And obese women (BMI 30 kg/m2 or more) should gain 11 to 20 pounds. The key is steady and gradual weight gain over the course of pregnancy. "Eating for two" is an exaggeration. Pregnant women only need an additional 300 to 500 calories per day in the first trimester, and 350 to 450 calories in the second trimester. In the third trimester, the calorie needs increase to 450 to 500 calories per day. So pregnant women need more food but not twice as much as normal.

It is important for pregnant women to take certain vitamins and minerals during pregnancy to support their baby's development. Pregnant women need 600 micrograms of folic acid per day to help prevent neural tube defects in babies. Pregnant women also need vitamin D, calcium, and iron supplements. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and is vital for bone health. Calcium helps build a baby's bones and teeth. And iron carries oxygen to the baby and prevents anemia in the mother. Most prenatal vitamins contain adequate amounts of these nutrients, but some women may need additional iron supplements during pregnancy especially if they have a high risk of anemia. 

Pregnant women should avoid certain foods that may contain harmful bacteria like Listeria monocytogenes or parasites like Toxoplasma gondii that can cause foodborne illnesses and threaten the pregnancy. These foods include raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs; unpasteurized milk and foods made from unpasteurized milk; raw or undercooked sprouts like alfalfa sprouts; and raw or undercooked shellfish like oysters and clams. Pregnant women should also limit high mercury fish like shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish which can harm a baby's developing nervous system. Caffeine should also be limited to under 200 mg per day, and raw vegetables and raw or undercooked eggs should be properly washed and cooked to avoid danger of infection. Following healthy diet guidelines and the recommendations of an obstetrician can help ensure a safe pregnancy and healthy baby.
