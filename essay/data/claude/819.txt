Diagnostic findings and treatment options for infective exacerbation of COPD

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) refers to a group of progressive lung diseases that cause increasing breathlessness. The most common causes of COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis, which are usually caused by long-term smoking.  An acute exacerbation of COPD is defined as an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms that require additional therapy. Infective exacerbations are caused by bacterial or viral respiratory infections.

For patients presenting with an exacerbation of COPD symptoms such as increased breathlessness, coughing or change in sputum volume or color, diagnostic tests should be performed to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment. Spirometry can confirm the diagnosis of COPD and severity. A chest X-ray can detect signs of infection such as lobar collapse or consolidation. Sputum culture may identify bacterial pathogens, with Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis being the most common. Procalcitonin levels can also indicate bacterial infection. 

Antibiotic therapy is recommended for patients with moderate to severe exacerbations or those with purulent sputum and signs of bacterial infection. Amoxicillin, doxycycline or azithromycin are common first-line options. For severe exacerbations, hospitalization and ventilatory support may be required. Use of bronchodilators through nebulizers or inhalers can help relieve airflow obstruction. Corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation in the airways. Oxygen therapy should be titrated to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%.

Smoking cessation is the single most effective intervention to reduce the frequency and severity of COPD exacerbations. Counseling and nicotine replacement therapy should be offered to all patients. The National Service Framework for older people recommends annual flu immunization for patients over 65 with COPD. It also advocates integrated, multidisciplinary working between healthcare providers to provide optimal treatment and plan hospital discharge and follow-up, emphasizes early identification of exacerbations with prompt treatment in primary care when possible and promote patient empowerment through self-management of their condition.

In summary, exacerbation of COPD symptoms requires thorough clinical evaluation and diagnostic testing to determine the underlying cause, with bacterial infection being a common trigger. A combination of bronchodilators, antibiotics, corticosteroids and oxygen therapy are beneficial for most patients. Smoking cessation can significantly improve prognosis. A multidisciplinary approach involving physicians, nurses and other healthcare professionals as recommended in guidelines can optimize patient outcomes. With prompt treatment and better self-management, many patients can be managed in the community without requiring hospital admission.
