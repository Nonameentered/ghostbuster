There is an ongoing debate as to whether chimpanzees possess language abilities or simply exhibit sophisticated forms of communication. On the one hand, chimpanzees are highly social animals, and they have been shown to exhibit a variety of vocal and gestural signals in the wild and in captivity that serve to communicate important information to one another. However, human language abilities far surpass anything demonstrated in chimpanzees or any other nonhuman animals. 

Some researchers argue that certain aspects of chimpanzee communication resemble language. For example, chimpanzees have a variety of distinct vocalizations, such as the pant hoot or the excitement call, that they use in different social circumstances to convey emotional information to others. They also use manual gestures and facial expressions in contextually appropriate ways. Some scientists point to chimps that have been taught simplified symbolic languages, like those studied by Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, as evidence they have language abilities.

However, there are some crucial aspects of human language that chimpanzees do not possess. Human language has a complex grammar and syntax that allows us to form and comprehend an infinite number of novel sentences. Chimpanzee communication lacks these grammatical structures. They cannot arrange symbols or vocalizations in the diverse and complex ways that humans do with words and sentences. Human language is also highly abstract, allowing us to discuss ideas, feelings, objects, and events that are distant in space and time. There is little evidence chimpanzees have this same capacity for displacement and abstraction.

In conclusion, while chimpanzees are highly socially and communicatively intelligent animals, human language abilities are profoundly different and in many ways uniquely human. Chimpanzee communication resembles a complex system of signaling, but it lacks the hierarchical grammatical organization, abstraction, and generativity that characterizes human language. The research on ape language to date suggests there are differences in kind, not just degree, that separate our intellect from that of our closest living relatives. Overall, there is little evidence that chimpanzees truly possess anything equivalent to human language. Their impressive social intelligence and communication abilities serve their purposes but do not compare to the power, complexity, and abstraction afford by human language.
