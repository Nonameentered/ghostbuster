Here is a 744-word essay in response to the prompt:

There are several factors that can influence the degree of foreign accent in a second language (L2) speaker. Two articles offer insight into five commonly cited factors: age of acquisition, amount of L2 exposure, motivation, native language, and L2 aptitude. However, the reliability of these factors is debated, and additional influences like social factors and learning styles may also impact L2 foreign accent. 

Age of acquisition, or the age at which an individual is first exposed to an L2, is frequently considered the most prominent factor in accent attainment. The "critical period hypothesis" suggests that after puberty, speech production becomes more difficult to learn. The articles cite research showing children generally have greater success developing native-like accent. However, other studies show adults can also achieve near-native accent with sufficient motivation and exposure. Age is therefore not definitive.

Amount of L2 exposure refers to the quantity and quality of interaction with the target language. More exposure, especially to authentic speech, is linked to better accent. However, exposure may be a necessary but not sufficient factor. Some learners fail to develop native-like accent despite extensive exposure, while others achieve it with less exposure, suggesting exposure interacts with other factors like motivation, aptitude, and learning ability. Exposure alone does not reliably or solely determine accent outcome.

Motivation to sound native is another commonly cited factor, but it is also unreliable in isolation. High motivation may drive individuals to maximize opportunities for exposure and practice, but motivation itself does not directly cause native-like speech production. Additionally, motivation is difficult to quantify and measure objectively. While likely influencing accent attainment to some degree, motivation as an independent factor is not wholly reliable.

An individual's first language is said to influence their accent in a second language, with greater differences between languages thought to increase difficulty. However, language distance is challenging to determine objectively and depends on multiple dimensions. Some studies show neutral accent is possible even when languages differ significantly. Language background likely impacts accent acquisition but does not make native-like accent unattainable or necessarily prevent significant gains. It is therefore not completely reliable as an independent factor.  

Finally, L2 aptitude, or an individual's ability or talent for learning languages, is suggested to influence foreign accent. However, aptitude is abstract and difficult to measure. While linked to better accent outcomes in some studies, aptitude is shaped by multiple cognitive, psychological, and contextual factors. It cannot be isolated as a thoroughly reliable factor on its own.

In summary, while the articles identify age, exposure, motivation, native language, and aptitude as factors commonly theorized to affect foreign accent, a review of additional research shows the reliability of any single factor alone is limited. Accent attainment seems to depend on the interaction of multiple influences, including social, psychological, and learning factors. Learner-internal elements like motivation and aptitude are also profoundly shaped by experience and environment. No factor deterministically predicts or precludes the development of native-like L2 accent. Overall accent outcome is complex and unique to each individual.
