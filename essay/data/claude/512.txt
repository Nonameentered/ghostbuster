Here is a draft 750-word essay in response to the prompt:

The DNA sequence of the S-PM2 bacteriophage, a virus that infects marine cyanobacteria,  was analyzed using several methods. The primary methods used were shotgun sequencing, genome assembly, and comparative genomics. These techniques revealed insights into the evolution and ecology of this phage.

Shotgun sequencing was used to determine the complete nucleotide sequence of the 48,502 base pair genome of S-PM2. This involves breaking up the DNA into millions of small fragments that are sequenced individually. Bioinformatic methods are then used to reassemble these fragments into the complete genome sequence. Shotgun sequencing is a fast and affordable approach to sequencing entire genomes. 

Once the S-PM2 genome was assembled, open reading frames were identified that could encode proteins. There were 86 predicted protein-coding genes identified, most of which had no known function. Comparative analysis showed that about half of the S-PM2 genes were most similar to genes found in other cyanobacterial phages, indicating a shared evolutionary history. However, the other half of genes had no close matches to known genes, suggesting S-PM2 acquired a significant portion of its genome through horizontal gene transfer from unknown sources.

Further comparative genomics analysis placed the S-PM2 phage within the cyanomyovirus family, a group of phages known to infect cyanobacteria. The S-PM2 genome exhibited synteny, or conserved gene order, with two other cyanomyoviruses called Syn9 and P60, which infect freshwater and marine cyanobacteria, respectively. This indicates that genetically, S-PM2 is more closely related to other cyanomyoviruses than phages that infect heterotrophic bacteria. This finding suggests that phages have radiated to infect specific environments, such as cyanobacteria versus other bacteria.

In summary, shotgun sequencing and genome assembly were used to determine the complete genome sequence of the S-PM2 bacteriophage. Comparative genomics provided insights into its evolution and ecology, demonstrating its close relationships with other cyanomyoviruses that also infect cyanobacteria. Despite half of its genes having no known function or close relatives, S-PM2 exhibits conserved genome organization with other cyanomyoviruses, supporting its classification within this group. The methods used to study S-PM2 provide a model for analyzing newly discovered phages and unraveling their biological characteristics.
