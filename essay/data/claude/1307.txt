The three methods of heat transfer are conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction refers to the transfer of heat through direct contact between particles. It depends on the temperature difference and properties of the material such as thermal conductivity. Convection occurs through the bulk movement of fluids, either liquids or gases. Heat is transferred by the circulation or mixing of the heated and unheated regions. Radiation refers to the emission of electromagnetic waves which carry energy, which is then absorbed by other objects.  

The amount of heat transferred through conduction can be calculated using Fourier's law of heat conduction which states that the heat flux is proportional to the temperature gradient. The heat flux depends on the thermal conductivity of the material. Convective heat transfer can be calculated using Newton's law of cooling which states that the heat transfer rate is proportional to the temperature difference. The heat transfer coefficient, which depends on properties of the fluid like viscosity, is used to calculate convection. The heat transferred by radiation can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law which states that the total energy radiated per unit surface area of a blackbody per unit time is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature.

The ideal method for calculating heat transfer through radiation would be through directly measuring the electromagnetic waves emitted by the object using a radiation detector. However, this requires complex and expensive equipment. An alternative method is to assume the object behaves like a blackbody and calculate the radiation using the temperature and surface area. This is less accurate but more feasible in most experiments. 

Varying the pressure affects convective heat transfer through the Prandtl number, which is the ratio of momentum diffusivity and thermal diffusivity. At lower pressures, the mean free path of particles increases, reducing collisions. This reduces the momentum diffusivity but not the thermal diffusivity, increasing the Prandtl number. According to the Prandtl number, this means heat transfer becomes less efficient. At higher pressures, more collisions increase the momentum diffusivity, decreasing the Prandtl number and increasing the efficiency of heat transfer.

There are several inaccuracies in the experimental procedure. Assumptions such as the object behaving as a blackbody and uniform surface temperature introduce errors in radiation calculations. Unaccounted heat losses also reduce the measured heat transfer. Limitations in instrumentation accuracy and precision add uncertainty. Conduction through the connecting wires and convection by air currents could contribute to heat transfer in uncontrolled amounts. By identifying and minimizing such inaccuracies, the experimental procedure can be improved.
