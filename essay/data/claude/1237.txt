Here is a 250-word essay response:

Pneumatic actuators that use compressed air instead of electricity offer both advantages and disadvantages compared to traditional electrical motors and actuators. On the positive side, pneumatic systems are inherently safe since air is non-flammable, unlike the potentially combustible materials used in electrical systems. Pneumatic actuators can also generate high forces in compact spaces, are inexpensive to maintain as they have few moving parts, and can operate in hazardous environments where electric circuits are dangerous. 

However, pneumatic systems also have significant downsides. They require an air compressor and air storage tank which can be bulky and expensive. They typically have lower energy efficiency than electrical systems due to air leakage and pressure drops. The performance of pneumatic actuators can also vary with temperature and air pressure changes. Pneumatic circuits are used in many real-world automated devices, including assembly lines, robotics, valve controls, and automated tools where their high power-to-weight ratio and safety are beneficial.

The quality and pressure of the air supply are extremely important for the proper functioning of pneumatic systems. Contaminants in the air like water or oil droplets can damage pneumatic valves and cylinder seals, causing leaks. Inconsistent air pressure makes the speed, force, and position control of pneumatic actuators variable, negatively impacting precision automated operations. During experiments in my robotics laboratory, my team found that tuning the compressor and installing an air dryer and filters significantly improved the performance and reliability of our pneumatic robotic arm.

In conclusion, while pneumatic systems have some advantageous properties for high-force or hazardous environments, their disadvantages like lower energy efficiency and sensitivity to air quality highlight why electric actuators are often preferable for precision control and automation applications. With the right equipment and maintenance though, pneumatic circuits can be very useful for tasks where their benefits outweigh their costs.
