The use of indefinite pronouns, such as 'anyone,' 'everybody,' and 'everything,' has been shown to differ among various demographic groups in terms of frequency and semantic usage. This essay examines a potential research question and methodology to investigate gender and age differences in the use of indefinite pronouns using corpus linguistics techniques.

A relevant research question for this investigation could be: What are the differences in the use and distribution of indefinite pronouns between males and females and between younger and older age groups, as evidenced in large-scale corpora of natural language? This question aims to uncover potential differences in pronoun usage that could point to underlying differences in beliefs, attitudes, and communication styles between these demographic groups. 

To investigate this research question, a suitable methodology would be to analyze large, balanced corpora of natural language from speakers of different genders and age groups. Two prominent corpora that could be used for this purpose are the British National Corpus (BNC) and the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA). The BNC contains samples of written and spoken English from a wide range of demographic groups in the UK, including evenly balanced numbers of male and female participants from multiple age groups. The COCA contains over 560 million words of text from American English, including fiction and nonfiction books, newspapers, magazines, and spoken transcriptions. It is also evenly balanced for gender and includes texts from the 1990s through 2017, allowing for comparisons across age groups.

Using concordancing software, the frequency of indefinite pronouns could be compared across different sections of these corpora representing males vs. females and younger vs. older participants. Semantic prosody, or the tendency of a word to co-occur with words of a particular semantic group, could also be examined using collocation analysis. For example, the pronouns 'anybody' and 'everyone' may show differences in the strength of association with positive or negative words between males and females or younger and older speakers.

In summary, the use of large, balanced corpora such as the BNC and COCA can allow for data-driven investigations into how language use may differ across various demographic groups. Focusing on the distribution and semantics of indefinite pronouns in these corpora, we proposed a research question examining potential gender and age differences in the use of these pronouns. Differences found could provide insight into how beliefs and communication styles may differ between males and females or younger and older speakers. The results could have implications for theories of language variation and change. Corpus linguistics thus provides a powerful methodology for gaining new understandings of how demographic factors shape language.
