The vocative case in English, used when directly addressing someone, displays a number of interesting characteristics and patterns of use, especially when it comes to endearments and terms used among friends. These forms of address vary in how they are deployed depending on factors like gender, age, social class, and level of formality. They have also evolved significantly over time. 

One of the most prominent characteristics of the vocative in English is its heavy use of diminutives and hypocoristics, shortened or pet name versions of proper names. For example, Elizabeth becomes Liz, Beth, or Betty, and Robert becomes Rob, Bob, or Bobby. These are most commonly used among friends, family, and intimates. Their use suggests familiarity, affection, and informality. They are more common among younger people and women.

Another notable pattern is the use of generic endearments like ‘sweetheart,’ ‘darling,’ ‘dear,’ ‘love,’ and ‘honey.’ These are employed almost exclusively by women, especially among older generations. When used by men, they can seem ironic or patronizing. The gendered nature of these endearments points to wider trends of gender inequality that have shaped language use. They imply a kind of sentimental affection that has traditionally been more socially acceptable for women to express. 

Terms like ‘mate,’ ‘buddy,’ ‘pal,’ and ‘friend’ are more common among men, especially when addressing other men. They connote friendliness and camaraderie but in a somewhat impersonal, performative masculinity. Indeed, the vocative is an area where male social posturing and the performance of gender stereotypes is particularly evident. These terms are also more likely to be used among working class speakers.

The vocative case is also highly sensitive to formality and social distance. Close friends and family members use informal terms like diminished names and nicknames, as well as generic endearments. But as social distance increases, these become less appropriate and give way to ‘mate,’ ‘buddy’ and ‘friend’ - and formal titles like ‘sir,’ ‘madam’ and ‘miss.ʼ Notably, these titles have decreased in use in recent decades, signaling a move toward less rigidly hierarchal social relations in modern English-speaking societies.

In sum, the vocative case in English demonstrates a variety of interactional functions, especially in how intimate relationships are signaled through endearments, nicknames and familiar address. However, these linguistic means of expressing affection or camaraderie remain highly gendered, variable by factors like age and social class, and dependent on context like formality - all of which reveal wider social and cultural dynamics within the English language community. The vocative provides a window into how relationships are built and maintained through language.
