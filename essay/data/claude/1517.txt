Providing genuine hospitality in the commercial hospitality sector requires engaged and motivated employees with positive attitudes towards their work and customers. The motives and attitudes of employees have a significant influence on the quality of service provided to guests and patrons. There are several key factors that drive employee motivation and shape attitudes in the hospitality industry.

One of the primary motives for employees to provide good service is financial incentive and job security. Employees who are compensated well and feel stable in their jobs are more motivated to perform at a high level and exceed customer expectations. Compensation that includes both competitive wages as well as opportunity for tips or service charges gives employees a direct financial motivation to provide excellent service that warrants greater gratuities. Employees also value consistent work schedules, job security, and opportunities for advancement within the organization, all of which motivate employees to perform well in their current roles.

Another key factor shaping employee attitudes is the work environment and company culture. Employees thrive in work environments that value their wellbeing, provide adequate training and resources, and promote a spirit of teamwork. A positive company culture where employees feel respected and supported leads to greater job satisfaction, loyalty to the organization, and more positive attitudes towards both managers and customers. In contrast, hostile work environments characterized by poor training, lack of resources, and lack of team cohesion negatively impact employee morale, motivation, and performance.   

Employees are also motivated by intrinsic factors like recognition, feedback, and personal growth. Many hospitality employees find the work inherently rewarding when they receive praise and recognition from managers and customers for a job well done. Regular constructive feedback helps employees continuously improve their skills and better serve customers. And employees appreciate opportunities to advance their careers through on-the-job mentorship programs, training courses, and the possibility of promotion into leadership roles. These intrinsic motivations foster a sense of personal achievement and encourage employees to deliver ever-better service.  

In summary, employee motives and attitudes exert considerable influence over the quality of service in the hospitality industry. Financial incentives, job security, work environment, company culture, recognition, feedback, and opportunities for growth are all factors that help motivate employees and cultivate positive attitudes critical for providing genuine hospitality. When these motivations and attitudes are lacking or negative, service quality invariably suffers. Hospitality organizations should make employee wellbeing and engagement a top priority to enable consistent delivery of outstanding service. Focusing on competitive compensation, constructive feedback, team-building, and career growth opportunities will motivate employees to go above and beyond for guests, which ultimately benefits both employees and the company through greater job satisfaction, higher retention, increased productivity, and a superior customer experience.
