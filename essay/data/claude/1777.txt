Post-modern poetry developed in the postwar period of the 1950s and 60s as poets sought new forms of expression and experimentation following the massive cultural shifts of World War II. The New York School of poets, including Frank O'Hara, were on the forefront of this new poetry. They attempted to bridge a cultural gap between American and European art movements and influenced the decline of more traditional forms of poetry. 

The New York School was heavily influenced by surrealism, Dadaism, and the abstract expressionist art movement—initially European art forms that gained popularity in postwar New York. These poets sought to bring avant-garde European ideas into an American vernacular, fusing highbrow culture with everyday life. They believed art could be found anywhere and pulled ideas and themes from popular culture, casual conversations, and fleeting observations of city life.

Their poetry was radical in its experimentation. They utilized stream of consciousness, non sequiturs, and a loose, disconnected form. The result was a highly personal style focusing on the everyday moments of life in a chaotic yet wonderful way. Frank O'Hara in particular embodied this style. His poems like "The Day Lady Died" and "A Step Away from Them" captured his wanderings through New York, his interactions with friends, and musings on art and culture. His poetry feels like an intimate glimpse into his uncurated thoughts. 

This new form of highly personal, experimental poetry led to a decline in interest for more formal poetry. The Beats and counterculture movements adopted a similar free, rebellious spirit, and over time mainstream poetry evolved to favor more colloquial and accessible forms of expression. While controversial, the New York School was instrumental in popularizing avant-garde ideas that shaped 20th century poetry and art. They brought Europe to America and freed poetry from restriction, for better or for worse paving the way for an era where anything could be poetry.

Frank O'Hara and the New York School were pivotal in defining post-modern poetry and culture. Through their radical forms of expression and fusion of high and low culture, they shaped a new generation of poets seeking ultimate creative freedom and authenticity of voice. They aimed to capture the fleeting wonder of everyday city life—its chaos, beauty, and absurdity. The result was a body of work intimately woven into the fabric of New York itself.
