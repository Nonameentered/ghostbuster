The poem “My Last Duchess” by Robert Browning effectively conveys the theme of guilt and the repercussions of violent actions through the author's use of poetic techniques, such as alliteration, personification, and metaphors.

From the outset, the repeated ‘d’ sounds in the Duke’s opening line “That's my last duchess painted on the wall” creates a harsh and judgmental tone that highlights his controlling and vindictive nature. The alliteration emphasizes the possessiveness in the word ‘my’, indicating that he views the duchess as his property and object. This establishes his domineering character which ultimately leads to his jealous and sinister actions against the duchess. 

The personification of the painting further reinforces his tyrannical perspective of the duchess. The Duke says “The depth and passion of its earnest glance” brings the duchess to life through the portrait, suggesting that she is pleading for help and accusing him even after death. However, this figurative language more likely reflects the Duke’s guilty conscience for his heinous acts against her rather than the duchess’s actual emotions. His paranoid and menacing mindset is further evidenced when he says “sir ‘twas not her husband’s presence only, called that spot of joy into the duchess’ cheek”. The use of apostrophe shows him addressing an imaginary interlocutor, displaying his unhinged mental state.

The extended metaphor comparing the duchess to a domesticated animal also highlights the Duke’s masculine condescension and twisted views. He says “She had/A heart – how shall I say? – too soon made glad, /Too easily impressed; she liked whate’er/She looked on, and her looks went everywhere”. The likening of the duchess to a small creature that “went everywhere” and "was made glad" too easily suggests that she lacked self restraint and was unable to be controlled by her husband. This reflects more on the Duke’s tyrannical mindset rather than the duchess’s actual character. The comparison thus represents how his deep-seated feelings of powerlessness manifest in a need to exert control over his wife to the eventual point of violence.  

In conclusion, through the adept use of poetic techniques such as alliteration, personification and extended metaphors, the poem “My Last Duchess” demonstrates how the Duke’s oppressive nature and malignant psyche leads him to kill his wife in a desperate attempt to exert control over her, reflecting the theme of how unrestrained power and violence only breeds more guilt and suffering. The poetic tools emphasize how the repercussions of his sinister actions will continue to haunt him even after her death.
