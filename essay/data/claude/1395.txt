The epic tradition spanning from Homer's Iliad and Odyssey through Lucan's Pharsalia chronicles a significant evolution in the nature of heroism and the depiction of heroic figures. The early Greek epics focusing on the Trojan War and its aftermath demonstrate a conception of heroism centered around bravery in battle, honor and glory, and a code of heroism represented by virtues of courage, strength, and aristocratic nobility. However, as the epic tradition developed in the Roman period, the notion of heroism became more complex and problematic. Lucan's Pharsalia portrays Caesar in a far more ambiguous light, suggesting a tension between the traditional epic hero and the subversive figure of the tyrant.

In Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, heroism is portrayed in a mostly uncritical, celebratory light. Epic heroes like Achilles, Odysseus, and Diomedes are defined by their bravery in battle, their strength, courage, and prowess as warriors. They fight for honor, glory, and a sense of eternal fame and recognition. Achilles, the greatest of the Greek warriors, is motivated by his desire for glory and to be remembered as the strongest fighter. The virtues that define a Homeric hero are physical strength, bravery in battle, pride, and a noble lineage or aristocratic background. The gods themselves favor and support the epic heroes, demonstrating their high, almost superhuman status. 

However, in later Roman epics, the conception of heroism becomes more problematic and complex. Lucan's Pharsalia uses the figure of Julius Caesar to explore the tension between traditional epic heroism and a new brand of subversive and tyrannical heroism. Caesar exhibits the martial prowess, courage, and nobility of a typical epic hero. But he also possesses dangerous qualities of hubris, arrogance, and a willingness to tear the Roman world apart through civil war in his quest for power. Although he sees himself as a champion of the people, Caesar proves himself a tyrant who crushes dissent and democracy. Thus, Lucan's poem suggests an inherent contradiction between Caesar as epic hero and Caesar as villainous tyrant. Rather than being uncritical, Lucan uses the epic form to raise profound questions about morality, power, and the threat of tyranny.

In conclusion, the epic tradition demonstrates a marked change in conceptions of heroism and in depictions of heroic figures. The Homeric epics established a template of heroism focused on bravery, honor, glory, and martial prowess. However, later epics like Lucan's Pharsalia subverted and complicated this model by featuring heroes who could also be seen as tyrannical villains. Thus, the epic tradition provides a revealing glimpse into how notions of morality, power, and human potential evolved over the course of antiquity. Heroism was not a static concept but rather one that adapted to reflect the preoccupations and anxieties of each culture and historical moment.
