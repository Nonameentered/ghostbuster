Hernan Cortes was the Spanish conquistador who led the conquest of the Aztec Empire in Mexico in the early 16th century. His actions and leadership were instrumental in the success of the Spanish in overthrowing the Aztec ruler Moctezuma II and establishing control over much of Mexico. However, historical accounts of Cortes and the conquest of Mexico vary significantly, shaped by the perspectives and biases of the authors. By analyzing multiple historical accounts, we can develop a more balanced understanding of Cortes's role and leadership, as well as the range of factors that contributed to the ultimate Spanish victory.

Many Spanish accounts portray Cortes as a heroic figure who overcame tremendous odds through his courage, cunning, and skill as a military leader. Francisco López de Gómara, Cortes's chaplain and biographer, described him in glowing terms, emphasizing his charisma, determination, and quick-thinking. According to López de Gómara, Cortes rallied his men with stirring speeches, outmaneuvered the Aztecs through strategic alliances with native groups, and triumphed despite being outnumbered. These accounts suggest Cortes's leadership and military prowess were the primary reasons for success. 

However, other historical accounts provide a more complex picture of Cortes and the conquest. Bernardino de Sahagún, a Spanish missionary, compiled accounts from Aztec informants that described Cortes more ambiguously, noting his aggression and cruelty as well as his charisma. Similarly, the anonymous Conquistador Anónimo acknowledged Cortes's leadership but also emphasized other factors, including divisions within the Aztec empire, native alliances, and the role of fellow captains like Pedro de Alvarado. These accounts point to a confluence of leadership, military skill, circumstance, technology, alliances, and luck in enabling the Spanish victory.

Modern historians have further reshaped our understanding by providing perspective on the biases in the historical records and emphasizing previously downplayed factors. Inga Clendinnen argues the accounts of "heroic" conquistadors like Cortes obscured the violence and moral ambiguities of the conquest. She highlights the role of interpreters like Malintzin, disease, and the Aztecs' belief the Spanish were mystic gods. Matthew Restall reevaluates the sources to show Cortes did not command a vastly outnumbered force, and highlights the role of native allies and the political fracturing of the Aztecs. He argues Cortes's success was due more to luck and circumstance than his personal qualities.   

In conclusion, while Cortes's leadership and skill were undoubtedly significant to the Spanish victory, historical accounts have shaped a narrative that overstates his personal role while obscuring the complexity of factors in play. By re-examining these accounts with a critical eye and balancing them with modern perspectives, we can develop a fuller understanding - one that acknowledges Cortes's singular feats but recognizes they were enabled by a multitude of other factors, including native allies, disease, technology, luck, and the political turmoil into which Cortes stepped. Cortes seized a historical moment, but he did not create it alone. A balanced analysis of history requires questioning heroic narratives and accounting for the perspectives left out. By doing so, we can achieve a clearer picture of the past and understand how its stories have come to shape our present views.
