Kripke's Necessary and Contingent Arguments Regarding A Priori and A Posteriori Knowledge

Saul Kripke famously challenged prevailing notions of the distinction between necessary and contingent statements, and a priori and a posteriori knowledge in his 1972 book Naming and Necessity. Kripke's arguments revealed new insights into how we gain knowledge about the world through language and reasoning. This essay will explain Kripke's arguments regarding these categories and show how they opened up new lines of philosophical inquiry.  

Philosophers traditionally viewed knowledge as coming in two forms: a priori, meaning knowledge gained through reason alone; and a posteriori, meaning knowledge gained through experience. Likewise, statements were thought to be either necessary - true in all possible worlds, knowable a priori; or contingent - true in some possible worlds, knowable only a posteriori. Kripke argued that this way of categorizing knowledge and statements was mistaken.

Kripke’s first insight was that some necessary truths are knowable only a posteriori. For example, the statement “water is H2O” expresses a necessary truth, since water is the same thing as H2O in all possible worlds. Yet we only know this through scientific investigation, not through pure reason alone. The example of "water is H2O" shows that the link between necessity and the a priori can be broken. Some necessary truths are a posteriori.

Similarly, Kripke argued that some contingent truths are a priori. For example, the statement “the king of France is bald” expresses a contingent truth, since there might be possible worlds where the king of France has hair. Yet we know this statement a priori, through reason alone, because we do not need any experience of the actual world to determine the truth of statements about the contingent properties of nonexistent entities like the king of France. The example of “the king of France is bald” shows that the link between contingency and the a posteriori can also be broken. Some contingent truths are a priori. 

Kripke's arguments here point to a deeper insight, which is that the source of our knowledge - whether a priori or a posteriori - does not determine whether the knowledge corresponds to necessary or contingent aspects of the world. Both necessity and contingency, he argues, are grounded in how we use language to represent the world, not in the epistemological source of our knowledge.

Kripke developed this view through his theory of rigid designators. According to Kripke, proper names and natural kind terms are rigid designators - they pick out the same thing in all possible worlds. So 'water' picks out H2O in all possible worlds, even if in other possible worlds the stuff with the same appearance and properties is not H2O. Because these designators are rigid, statements involving them express necessary truths. But we only discover that necessity a posteriori, when we discover the identity, like that water is H2O.  

In contrast, descriptions like 'the king of France' do not rigidly designate anything. They pick out different entities in different possible worlds, or may pick out nothing at all. So statements involving them express contingent truths. But we know their contingency a priori, through an understanding of how such language works, without experience of the actual world. 

In sum, Kripke showed that the traditional categories of necessary/contingent and a priori/a posteriori were mismatched. Some necessary truths are a posteriori, like 'water is H2O'. Some contingent truths are a priori, like 'the current king of France is bald'. The source of knowledge is separate from its modal status. Kripke grounded this insight in a theory of rigid and non-rigid designators, showing how the semantics of our language is where necessity and contingency originate. His powerful and original arguments opened up new areas of investigation in philosophy of language, metaphysics, and epistemology, and remain deeply influential today.
