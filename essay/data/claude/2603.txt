Nutritional deficiencies are common in the diets of many college students, including those studying nutrition. Studies from the mid-2000s found that nutrition students often had diets lacking in several key nutrients despite their nutrition education and knowledge. Their intake fell short of recommended levels in areas like calcium, iron, folate, and vitamins D and E.  

Calcium is essential for bone health, muscle function, and cellular signaling. The recommended calcium intake for most adults is around 1,000 mg per day. However, studies found nutrition students averaged only around 700 to 800 mg per day, about 70-80% of the recommended level. Many students failed to consume dairy products or plant-based sources of calcium on a regular basis to meet their needs.

Iron is important for red blood cell production and preventing anemia. The recommended iron intake for premenopausal women is 18 mg per day and 8 mg per day for men. Studies found female nutrition students consumed only around 12 mg per day on average, about two-thirds of the recommended amount. Male students fared better but still fell slightly below recommendations at around 7 mg per day. Many students reported low intakes of iron-rich foods like red meat, poultry, and beans.

Folate is a B vitamin that helps produce and maintain new cells. The recommended folate intake for most adults is around 400 mcg per day. However, studies found nutrition students averaged around 300 mcg per day, 25% below the recommendation. Few students reported eating folate-fortified foods or enough fruits and vegetables to meet their needs. 

Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption and bone health. The recommended intake for vitamin D is 600 IU per day for most adults. However, studies found nutrition students averaged only around 200 to 300 IU per day from food sources, 50-50% of the recommendation. Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D, highlighting the importance of fortified foods and supplements.  

Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant protecting cells from damage. The recommended intake for vitamin E is 15 mg per day for most adults. Studies found nutrition students averaged around 7 to 8 mg per day, about half the recommended amount. Nuts, seeds, and vegetable oils are good sources of vitamin E but were lacking in many studentsâ€™ diets.

In summary, while nutrition students likely had a strong grasp of nutritional science, their own diets lacked several key nutrients and fell short of expert recommendations. Calcium, iron, folate, vitamin D, and vitamin E were commonly underconsumed based on studies from the mid-2000s. Regular intake of fortified foods, dairy products, lean proteins, fruits and vegetables could help address these deficiencies and promote better overall health and wellness in nutrition students and the broader population. Education is important but action and behavioral changes are equally essential to achieving optimal nutrition and wellness.
