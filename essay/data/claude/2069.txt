Commercial whaling has a long and controversial history spanning many centuries. Whales were originally hunted for their oil, which was used for lighting, lubrication, and other purposes. However, many whale populations were hunted to near extinction by the mid-20th century due to the rise of industrial whaling. In response, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) banned commercial whaling beginning in 1986. However, some countries continue limited whaling today, primarily hunting minke whales and fin whales. 

Whaling dates back to at least the 9th century. Whale oil became a valuable commodity and economic driver, and was used to light homes and businesses in many parts of the world. The rise of steam power in the 19th century enabled much larger whaling fleets, and whaling became a major industry. Whaling fleets from the U.S., Britain, Norway, Japan and other nations hunted many species of whales, including sperm whales, gray whales, humpback whales, and blue whales. 

By the early 20th century, many whale populations had been decimated. Hunting continued largely unregulated until the 1946 creation of the IWC. The IWC initially attempted to sustainably regulate whaling but had little success. Most commercial whaling was banned in 1986 in response to declining whale populations. The moratorium allowed most whale stocks to begin recovering. However, Iceland, Japan, and Norway objected to the moratorium and continue limited whaling.

Today, the primary species hunted are minke whales and fin whales. Iceland hunts fin whales and minke whales, primarily for meat consumption in Iceland. Japan continues to hunt minke whales in the Antarctic under the guise of "scientific research," though much of the meat ends up in commercial markets. Norway also hunts minke whales. In 2018, these three nations killed nearly 1300 whales in total.

The international community widely condemns commercial whaling. However, the objections filed by Iceland, Japan, and Norway to the 1986 IWC moratorium allow them to continue limited whaling legally. The key aims of Iceland's whaling are commercial sale of whale meat domestically and promotion of national traditional culture related to whaling. However, most Icelanders no longer eat whale meat regularly or see whaling as an important cultural tradition. The IWC and conservation groups continue to pressure Iceland and other whaling nations to end their whaling programs due to animal welfare and conservation concerns. However, little progress has been made, and the disagreement is ongoing.

In summary, commercial whaling has declined dramatically since the mid-20th century due to the devastation of whale populations from unregulated hunting. However, Iceland, Japan, and Norway continue limited whaling today, primarily hunting minke whales and fin whales supposedly for commercial and cultural reasons. The IWC and other groups widely condemn ongoing whaling, but Iceland, Japan, and Norway exploit loopholes to continue these practices legally. The status quo seems likely to persist without a significant change in policies or perspectives.
