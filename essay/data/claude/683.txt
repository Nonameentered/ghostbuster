Here is a draft 1500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) refers to a complete or partial blockage of the small intestine. There are several potential causes of small bowel obstruction, including adhesions, hernias, tumors, and volvulus. Adhesions are bands of scar tissue that form after abdominal surgery and that can wrap around and compress the intestines, causing an obstruction. Hernias occur when part of the intestinal tract protrudes through a weakness in the abdominal wall. If the intestine becomes trapped in the hernia, it can become obstructed. Tumors, both benign and malignant, can also cause SBO by blocking the intestinal lumen. Volvulus refers to a twisting of the bowel that can strangulate the blood supply and obstruct flow.  

The management of SBO depends on the underlying cause and severity. In a partial obstruction or complete obstruction without compromised blood flow, initial treatment is typically conservative with fluid resuscitation, bowel rest, and decompression via nasogastric tube. If the obstruction does not resolve in 3-5 days with conservative treatment or if the patient shows signs of strangulation with compromised blood flow, then surgical intervention is required. The surgeon will locate the obstruction via exploratory laparotomy and relieve the obstruction through resection and anastomosis or adhesiolysis. In severe cases, an emergency laparotomy and bowel resection may be required to save the patient's life.

A strangulated femoral hernia in particular requires emergency surgery. A femoral hernia occurs when abdominal contents protrude through the femoral canal in the groin. If the herniated bowel becomes trapped and strangulated, blood flow is cut off, leading to ischemia and perforation. Signs of a strangulated femoral hernia include a painful, irreducible groin mass, nausea and vomiting, abdominal distention, and fever. Emergency surgery is required to reduce the hernia and resect any nonviable bowel. During the procedure, the hernia defect is also repaired to prevent recurrence. Without surgery, a strangulated femoral hernia can become life-threatening within hours as the bowel tissue begins to die.

In summary, the potential causes of small bowel obstruction include adhesions, hernias, tumors, and volvulus. Management depends on the severity but may include conservative treatment, laparotomy with bowel resection or adhesiolysis, or emergency surgery for strangulation. A strangulated femoral hernia in particular is a surgical emergency that requires immediate reduction and hernia repair along with bowel resection as needed. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, even patients with strangulated hernias typically recover well and avoid life-threatening complications.
