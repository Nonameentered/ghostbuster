The implementation of Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs) in Brazil in the 1990s had a significant impact on the rise and radicalization of the Brazilian Movement of Landless Rural Workers (MST). The SAPs were economic policies mandated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank as conditions for refinancing Brazil’s foreign debt. They included trade liberalization, tight control of inflation, reduction of fiscal deficit, and privatization of state-owned companies. These policies exacerbated poverty and inequality in rural Brazil, spurring the growth of the MST. 

The SAPs exposed Brazil’s agricultural sector to global competition, disadvantaging small family farmers. The removal of tariffs and subsidies made it difficult for them to compete with large agribusinesses and cheap imported goods. Many went bankrupt or were forced into the informal economy. Rural poverty rose sharply, increasing the demand for land redistribution. The MST organized more land occupations, especially in the South and Southeast, and its membership grew rapidly.

The anti-inflationary policies also contributed to rising rural poverty. The government tightened money supply, raised interest rates, and cut public spending. While inflation declined, unemployment rose. Rates were highest in the agricultural sector, as high-interest rates made agricultural loans unaffordable for small farmers. With less access to credit, many could not maintain production. The MST blamed the SAPs for the crisis in agriculture and called for agrarian reform to support small farmers.

Reduction of fiscal deficit impacted rural areas disproportionately. The government cut spending on health, education, infrastructure, and agricultural support programs to balance the budget. Rural Brazil depended heavily on public investment but saw a decline in services. The MST organized protests against austerity, arguing it aggravated poverty while benefiting large agribusinesses. The movement demanded increased spending on agrarian reform and rural development.

The SAPs were seen by the MST as a symbol of the neo-liberal order that prioritized the free market over social justice and equity. The MST rejected privatization and trade liberalization as strategies that increased foreign control over Brazil’s economy while exploiting workers and natural resources. The movement campaigned against neo-liberal globalization and called for building an alternative model of agricultural production based on food sovereignty and agroecology.

The radicalizing conflict culminated in a massacre of 19 landless workers in Eldorado dos Carajás in 1996. In response, the MST intensified mobilization for agrarian reform, organizing a nationwide march attracting over 70,000 people in Brasilia. The World Bank released $90 million to fund market-based land reform, hoping to defuse tensions. However, the MST argued that market mechanisms would not resolve the root causes of rural poverty and inequality, calling instead for undercutting the power of large landowners by redistributing land and restructuring agriculture.

In conclusion, the SAPs adopted in Brazil aggravated the crisis in the agricultural sector and disproportionately impacted the rural poor. The policies that tightened money supply, cut public spending, and increased foreign competition devastated small farming. The MST grew in response, organizing land occupations and protests to demand agrarian reform and rural development. The movement shaped the debate around neo-liberal globalization and alternative models of agriculture. Though the World Bank attempted to fund market-based land reform, the MST continued campaigning for more radical redistribution of wealth and power to benefit the landless.
