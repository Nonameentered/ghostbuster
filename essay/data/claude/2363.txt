Television advertisements employ a variety of language techniques to persuade viewers to purchase a product or service. Different sign systems, such as images, text, sound, music, and video footage work together to convey an overall persuasive message.

One of the most common techniques used is appealing to the emotions of the audience. Creating a sense of happiness, excitement or even fear associated with a product triggers an emotional response in viewers that compels them to buy the item. For example, an advertisement for a luxury cruise line may show scenes of a glamorous ship, gourmet meals, exotic destinations and people with ecstatic facial expressions and upbeat music. This creates a sense of an aspirational lifestyle that viewers long to experience for themselves through purchasing a trip. 

Repetition is also frequently used, repeating the brand name, product benefits or a catchy jingle multiple times to make it memorable. Rhyme or alliteration make messages even more unforgettable. For example, "I'm lovin' it" or "Finger lickin' good" stay with audiences long after the advertisement has aired. These verbal techniques are made even more potent when combined with visuals. Seeing the product or company logo multiple times on screen while also hearing it stated audibly embeds it firmly into the viewer's mind.

Hyperbole or exaggeration is commonly used, especially when selling beauty or lifestyle products. Descriptions like "miraculous results" or "revolutionary formula" prompt the audience to buy into the inflated claims about a product's effectiveness or superiority. Equally, advertisements frequently employ emotive language, using strong or dramatic words to evoke a reaction. Phrases such as "indulge your senses", "unparalleled luxury" or "heart-stopping power" are intended to excite interest and motivate purchasing.

The use of taboo or suggestive language also varies based on the age and gender of the audience. Interviews reveal that older age groups and women tend to have more conservative views about explicit language and sexually objectifying content in advertisements. This is partly due to generational ideals as well as the historic marginalization and objectification of women in media and advertising. For example, a female in her 60s stated she found overtly sexualized ads for products like deodorant or hamburgers to be "demeaning, inappropriate and unnecessary". In contrast, younger males were more accepting of risqu√© content and saw it as "just a bit of fun". They did not believe it significantly impacted their view of women or attitudes in general.  

In summary, television advertisements are highly complex sign systems that rely on verbal and visual techniques to create persuasive messages. Emotional appeals, repetition, hyperbole and taboo language are frequently used to generate interest in a product and motivate purchasing behavior. However, attitudes toward the appropriateness and impact of taboo content differ among various age groups and genders based on diverse life experiences, values and sensitivities. Overall, advertisements provide insight into how meaning is constructed in society and how groups can perceive similar messages in very different ways.
