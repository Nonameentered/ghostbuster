Here is a 500 word essay in response to the prompt:

The Drude and Sommerfeld models were early theoretical frameworks proposed to explain the behavior of electrons in metals. However, they had several limitations and discrepancies that were assessed using solid state simulations based on fundamental laws of physics.  

The Drude model treated electrons as classical particles that obey Newton’s laws of motion. It failed to account for the wave-like nature of electrons described by quantum mechanics. The Sommerfeld model improved on this by incorporating the Fermi-Dirac distribution to describe electron energies in metals. However, it still depicted electrons as non-interacting particles that obey classical mechanics. In reality, electrons interact and influence each other's motion due to their charge.

Simulations of electron behavior in metals revealed these models were oversimplified. Quantitative measurements of electron scattering times and mobilities did not match the theoretical predictions. The models predicted infinite electrical conductivity at absolute zero, contradicting experimental results. They also failed to explain positive charge carriers observed in some metals and the phenomenon of magnetoresistance.

More accurate simulations incorporated quantum mechanics by solving the Schrödinger equation for electrons in a periodic potential. They modeled electrons as a Fermi gas that obeys the Pauli exclusion principle. Coulomb interactions between electrons were included using perturbation theory. These simulations yielded scattering times, mobilities and conductivities that matched experiments. They also reproduced positive charge carriers and magnetoresistance. 

In summary, the Drude and Sommerfeld models provided a simple theoretical understanding of electron motion in metals but their classical treatment of electrons led to several discrepancies with experiments. Simulations based on quantum mechanics and electromagnetism helped identify the models’ limitations and yielded results consistent with real electron behavior and properties of metals. Fundamental laws of physics were key to developing more realistic simulations and gaining insights into the complex dynamics of electrons in solids.
