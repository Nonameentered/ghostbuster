Carl Becker challenged traditional methods of historical writing that were prevalent in the early 20th century by advocating for a more interpretive and narrativized approach to history. Becker argued that historical facts do not speak for themselves and that historians actively construct historical narratives to make sense of the past. His work was significant in promoting a more imaginative and literary style of historical writing in American historiography. 

In the early 20th century, most professional historians subscribed to a model of scientific objectivity in historical writing. They believed that the historian’s role was to uncover objective facts about the past through rigorous archival research and then recount those facts accurately without interpretation. This model of objectivity was influenced by positivism, which held that there were objective historical truths that could be discerned through empirical research. Historians like Charles Beard advocated for “scientific” methods in history, focusing on facts and evidence over narrative or literary approaches.

Becker challenged this prevailing model of objectivity in history. In his 1931 essay “Everyman His Own Historian,” Becker argued that “the facts of history do not exist for any historian until he creates them.” Historians actively select and organize historical details to craft an interpretive narrative. Becker contended that there was no single objective truth in history and that historical facts took on meaning only when embedded within a historian's narrative. Historians were creators, not just discoverers, of facts. 

Becker also promoted a more imaginative and literary style of historical writing. He believed that history should engage and inspire readers, not just recount facts. In his essays “Detachment and the Writing of History” and “What are Historical Facts?” Becker argued that lively historical narratives could accomplish this by dramatizing the past through rich detail, compelling characters, and dramatic arcs - much like fiction. He believed history should be written for the everyday reader, not just fellow historians.

Becker’s vision of history as imaginative construction and narrative art challenged prevailing notions of objective, scientific history. His work was controversial but helped open the discipline to more interpretive approaches. Becker promoted a style of history as literature that brought history alive for general readers. His influence shaped subsequent generations of historians who adopted more narrativized and literary styles of writing history for public audiences.  

Becker’s work was significant in helping establish history as an interpretive craft and narrative art in the U.S. Through his forceful essays, Becker articulated a powerful case for historical imagination, public readership, and storytelling that broke from conventions of his time. He envisioned history as a means to inspire wonder in readers through dramatic, vivid accounts of the past - not just report facts. Becker’s vision for history proved profoundly influential and prescient as 20th-century American historiography became more oriented toward public audiences, narrative modes of writing, and the social construction of the past. His work marks an important turning point in the profession’s understanding of historical epistemology and in recognizing the narrative nature of the historian’s craft.
