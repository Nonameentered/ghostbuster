Observing Zeeman splitting and quadrupole shifting in the nuclei of magnetite has yielded important insights into the magnetic properties and structure of this material. Zeeman splitting refers to the splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external magnetic field. When the magnetic nuclei in magnetite are subjected to an external field, the energy levels of the nuclei split into multiple closely spaced levels. By measuring the spacing between these split energy levels, scientists can calculate the strength of the internal magnetic field generated by the unpaired electron spins in the material. 

These measurements have shown that magnetite produces an extremely strong internal magnetic field, demonstrating its utility as a magnetic material. Observing quadrupole shifting, which refers to shifts in the energy levels due to the interaction between the nuclear quadrupole moment and local electric field gradients, has provided details about the chemical environment of the magnetic nuclei in magnetite. This has allowed researchers to confirm the presence of ferric and ferrous iron atoms in very specific lattice sites, consistent with magnetite's chemical formula.

Taken together, these nuclear magnetic resonance techniques have been instrumental in revealing magnetite's strong ferrimagnetic properties that arise from its very particular chemical structure. With a precise understanding of which atoms occupy which sites in the magnetite lattice, scientists have been able to develop theories to explain itsability to produce strong magnetic fields and behave as a unified magnetic domain. These foundational insights paved the way for applications of magnetite, and similar strongly magnetic materials, in technologies such as magnetic storage media, magnetic sensors, and ferrofluids. In summary, probing the nuclei of magnetite through Zeeman splitting and quadrupole shifting has provided a window into its unique magnetic and chemical properties.
