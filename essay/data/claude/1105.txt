Ultrasound refers to acoustic waves that have a frequency above the range of human hearing, typically above 20,000 Hertz. Ultrasound is used extensively for non-destructive testing and medical imaging purposes. For non-destructive testing, high frequency ultrasound waves are transmitted into a material to detect internal flaws or characterize material properties. In medicine, ultrasound is used for imaging internal body structures without the use of ionizing radiation.  

There are three main methods of acoustic wave propagation in solids: longitudinal waves, shear waves, and surface waves. Longitudinal waves cause particles to oscillate back and forth along the direction of wave propagation. They can propagate through liquids and solids. Shear waves cause particles to oscillate perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. They can only propagate through solids. Surface waves travel along the surface of a material, their energy concentrated near the surface. They also propagate only through solids.

Several variables affect the ability of ultrasound to detect flaws. A shorter ultrasound wavelength allows for detection of smaller flaws. The diameter of the transducer also has an effect. A larger diameter transducer generates a wider beam, allowing more of the material to be inspected, but with lower resolution. A smaller diameter transducer has higher resolution but inspects a smaller area. The frequency of the ultrasound wave is directly related to its wavelength, so higher frequency waves have shorter wavelengths and allow detection of smaller defects.

The piezoelectric effect refers to the generation of electrical charge in certain solid materials in response to applied mechanical stress. This effect also works in reverse, with an applied electrical field generating mechanical deformation in the material. Specific piezoelectric materials like lead zirconate titanate (PZT) crystals are used to both generate and detect ultrasound. Applying an alternating current across the PZT causes it to vibrate at the same frequency and generate an ultrasound wave. When the wave reflects off a surface, it causes the PZT to vibrate and generate a small electrical charge which can be detected. This is the basis for ultrasonic transducers that are used for non-destructive testing and medical ultrasound.

In summary, ultrasound refers to high-frequency sound waves beyond human hearing. It is used extensively for non-destructive materials testing and medical imaging. Variables like wavelength, transducer diameter, and frequency affect its ability to detect flaws. The piezoelectric effect allows for generation and detection of ultrasound using materials like PZT crystals. Ultrasound does not employ ionizing radiation, making it useful for medical imaging purposes.
