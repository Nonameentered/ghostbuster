DNA melting curve refers to the process of DNA double-stranded helix unwinding and separating into single strands upon heating. As the temperature increases, the double-stranded DNA begins to unzip or melt apart, subsequently reducing the number of base pairs held together by hydrogen bonds. The melting temperature or Tm corresponds  to the temperature at which half of the DNA double strands have separated into single strands. 

The melting curve depends on several factors, including DNA sequence, salt concentration, and pH. The steeper the slope of the melting curve, the more cooperative the helix-to-coil transition is. By measuring the melting curve of DNA, one can gain insights into the thermodynamics of the helix-to-coil transition. Specifically, the Van't Hoff transition enthalpy (ΔH), change in entropy (ΔS), and Gibbs free energy (ΔG) can be determined.

The Van't Hoff transition enthalpy refers to the energy required to break all hydrogen bonds between complementary DNA strands during the melting process. It is calculated from the slope of a plot of 1/Tm versus ln(C), where C is the DNA strand concentration. The ΔS represents the increase in randomness and disorder when DNA double helix melts into single strands. It is calculated from ΔH/Tm. The Gibbs free energy, which indicates the spontaneity of a reaction, is determined by ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. At the melting temperature Tm, ΔG = 0. 

In summary, by measuring the melting curve of DNA through techniques such as UV-Vis absorbance spectroscopy and determining how Tm changes with DNA concentration and salt concentration, one can gain insights into the thermodynamic parameters of DNA melting. The derived ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG values provide information on the strength and stability of DNA double helices, which has important implications for biological processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and hybridization.
