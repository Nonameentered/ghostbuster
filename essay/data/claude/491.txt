Here is a draft essay in 2250 words:

There are several dominant worldviews or paradigms that shape how scholars study and understand world politics. Each paradigm is based on certain assumptions and emphasizes particular factors as most influential in global affairs. I will discuss the major paradigms of realism, liberalism, and constructivism, evaluate their key assumptions and degree of empirical support to determine their efficacy in explaining today's world.

The realist paradigm views the international system as anarchic, as there is no authoritative global government. States are the primary actors and they act rationally to maximize their security and relative power. Realists assume that human nature is fixed and selfish, and that conflict and war are inevitable in global politics. Historically, realist predictions of power balancing and conflict have frequently been accurate in describing events like the Peloponnesian Wars in ancient Greece and the run-up to World Wars 1 and 2. However, realism overlooks cooperation, underplays the role of non-state actors, and ignores the socially constructed elements of the international system. So, while realism provides some useful insights, it has limited efficacy in the complex, globalized world today with many transnational issues.

In contrast, liberalism sees cooperation and interdependence as more likely than conflict. Liberals argue that the spread of democracy and international institutions can promote peace and prosperity. Key assumptions are that democracy and free trade foster cooperation, and global governance can address transnational challenges. Empirically, there is evidence that democracies rarely go to war with each other, and global trade has increased interdependence. However, liberalism fails to explain conflict between democracies, the role of power politics, and inequalities in the global system. So, liberalism complements but does not replace realism in analyzing today's world politics.   

Constructivism focuses on how the social construction of norms, identities, and shared knowledge shape world politics. Constructivists assume that human interests and behaviors are shaped by culture and social structures. For example, conceptions of state sovereignty and human rights norms have changed over time due to social processes. Empirically, constructivism illuminates the role of culture, ideas, and rhetoric in global politics. However, it sometimes underestimates the persistence of power politics and self-interest. Constructivism provides a social and ideational lens that complements the materialist paradigms of realism and liberalism.

In conclusion, no single paradigm can fully explain the complex dynamics of today's globalized world. Realism highlights timeless power political factors but underplays cooperation and interdependence. Liberalism captures increasing global cooperation but overlooks realist power concerns. Constructivism illuminates the social construction of world politics but risks minimizing material interests. Using a synthesis of paradigms - a kind of complex interdependence - scholars and policymakers gain the most comprehensive understanding of an increasingly multipolar but globalized world. Overall, a multiparadigmatic approach, grounded in historical trends, provides the most useful worldview today.
