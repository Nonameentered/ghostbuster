Two Component Systems (TCS) in bacteria such as E.coli are a vital means of sensing and responding to environmental stimuli. There is significant inter-pathway communication within the network of TCS, allowing integration of multiple signals and a coordinated response. To understand how this complex network functions as a system, several approaches have been proposed. 

The first approach is to map the topology and connectivity of the TCS network. Bioinformatic tools can be used to identify genes encoding histidine kinases and response regulators, the two components of a TCS, and predict which pairs function together as pathways. However, computational predictions need to be validated experimentally by techniques such as yeast two-hybrid analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. Knowledge about which pathways are directly or indirectly connected allows modeling of how a signal may propagate through the network.

A second approach is to determine the activation profiles of each TCS pathway in response to specific signals or under defined conditions. Techniques like transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics can be used to monitor expression, activity, and phosphorylation levels of histidine kinases and response regulators following a stimulus. Information about how each pathway responds dynamically as signals in the environment change provides insight into how connectivity translates into coordinated system responses. These activation profiles suggest which pathways directly regulate one another, but do not conclusively prove how information is being transmitted within the network.

Therefore, a third approach is needed to characterize the direct physical and functional interactions between TCS pathways. Histidine kinases often act as phosphoreceivers and can phosphorylate a response regulator other than its cognate partner. Identifying these cross-regulations requires assaying the ability of each histidine kinase to phosphorylate each response regulator in vitro. In some cases, techniques like bacterial two-hybrid systems and chromatin immunoprecipitation can also be used to demonstrate direct regulatory interactions in vivo. Interactions between sensory kinases and non-cognate pathways represent key nodes for communication within the TCS network.

Finally, a systems-level understanding requires computational modeling to determine how these interactions translate into emergent properties of the network. Models must incorporate knowledge about network connectivity, histidine kinase-response regulator pairings, cross-regulatory interactions between pathways, activation profiles in response to stimuli, and the dynamics of protein interactions and enzymatic activities. Initial models may be static, but dynamic models are needed to fully understand network behaviors. Success of the models in predicting whole cell behaviors or responses to new signals helps refine knowledge about information processing within the TCS network.   

In summary, studying inter-pathway communication in the E.coli TCS network requires an integrated approach combining bioinformatics, experimental techniques, and computational modeling. Defining network connectivity, monitoring pathway activation profiles, characterizing cross-regulatory links between specific kinases and regulators, and modeling how these give rise to system properties are all required to understand how bacterial cells sense, communicate, and adapt to their environment. With comprehensive knowledge and understanding of this signal transduction network, synthetic or rewired TCS may be designed to tailor cellular behaviors for biotechnology applications.
