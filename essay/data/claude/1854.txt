Here is a draft 1750 word essay in response to the prompt:

Philosophers have long pondered questions about the nature of language and meaning. Some of the central questions they have grappled with include: What is the relationship between language and reality? How do words acquire meaning? How do we understand each other through language? Philosophers from Gottlob Frege to H.P. Grice have proposed theories attempting to answer these profound questions. 

Frege focused on the relationship between language and reality. He developed a theory called sense and reference to explain how words relate to the world. The reference of a word is the actual object or thing in the real world that the word refers to. The sense of a word, on the other hand, is the thought or mental concept associated with the word that allows us to understand its reference. Frege used the example of the words “the morning star” and “the evening star.” Although they refer to the same object, Venus, they have different senses. His theory aimed to show how the meanings of words are not purely subjective but actually connect language and reality.

In contrast, A.J. Ayer proposed an empiricist theory of meaning called logical positivism. He argued that the only meaningful statements are those that can be verified through experience and observation. Statements that do not describe observable phenomena, such as metaphysical or ethical claims, are literally meaningless. Meaning, for Ayer, comes from the empirical connections between language and reality. His theory was an attempt to show how philosophical problems can be solved by understanding language, but it was later criticized as being too restrictive in what it considers meaningful.

Karl Popper developed a theory of meaning called critical rationalism. Unlike the logical positivists, Popper argued that scientific and philosophical theories cannot be proven through observations or experience. Instead, the meaning of theories comes from their ability to be tested and proven false. A theory has meaning if it makes predictions that can be falsified. For Popper, the growth of knowledge comes through conjectures and refutations via critical argument, not verification. His theory aimed to explain how language and theories can be meaningful even when not empirically verifiable.  

Grice proposed a theory of meaning based on conversational implicature and intentionality. He argued that communication is achieved through inferring the intentions of the speaker. The meaning of an utterance depends not just on the literal meaning of the words but also the implied meaning that the speaker intends to convey and the inferential understanding of the listener. For example, saying “nice day” could be a conversational implicature meaning “let’s skip the small talk.” Grice showed how language achieves meaning through the cooperative principle and conversational implicature, relying on the complexities of human interaction and intention.

In summary, philosophers have proposed theories focusing on sense and reference, empirical verifiability, theoretical falsifiability, and conversational implicature to explore the relationship between language and reality as well as how meaning arises. Each theory aims to explain an important dimension of how we understand language and the world through it, though none are without their criticisms and limitations. Overall, these philosophers have made great strides in illuminating some of the deepest mysteries surrounding language and meaning. Their theories provide insight into both the connections and discontinuities between the words we use and the realities they aim to represent.
