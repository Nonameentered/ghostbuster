Disc brakes are one of the most critical components of a motor vehicle, responsible for safely slowing and stopping the vehicle. There are many theoretical and practical design considerations that go into engineering an effective disc brake system for a typical passenger saloon car. 

The most fundamental consideration is determining the braking torque requirement to lock up the wheels during maximum braking. This can be calculated based on the mass of the vehicle, the radius of the tires, and the coefficient of friction between the tires and the road surface. For a 1000 kg saloon car, the torque required to lock up a 225/45R17 tire on dry asphalt is around 300 Nm per wheel. This value will vary depending on the specific vehicle and tire dimensions, as well as the road conditions, but can be used as a starting point for disc brake design.

The variables associated with the design of a disc brake include the diameter and thickness of the brake discs, the number and size of the brake pads, the number and size of the brake pistons applying pressure to the pads, and the materials used for the pads and discs. Larger diameter discs provide more braking surface area and are better for heat dissipation, but are heavier and require larger wheel hubs. Thicker discs are more resistant to warping under high heat but are heavier. More and larger brake pads and pistons allow for higher maximum braking forces before lockup, at the cost of added weight and complexity.

The most common materials for brake discs are cast iron and steel, selected for their ability to withstand high temperatures without warping or wearing too quickly. Brake pads contain friction materials designed to optimize braking performance for the vehicle application. Pads with higher friction, more aggressive materials provide more braking torque for the same applied pressure but tend to wear out faster and produce more noise and dust. Pads with less aggressive, lower-friction materials are quieter and longer-lasting but need higher applied pressures to achieve the same braking torque. 

By optimizing these variables through simulation and testing, a disc brake system can be designed to provide the necessary braking torque for a saloon car while minimizing weight, complexity, and cost. The  performance of the system depends on the pad and disc materials selected based on balancing braking needs with longevity, noise, dust and other factors. More advanced materials and designs can provide higher performance for high-performance vehicles.

In summary, designing an effective disc brake system requires determining the braking torque needs for maximum performance braking, then selecting components like brake discs, pads, pistons and materials to meet those needs while optimizing cost, weight, wear life and other factors. When engineered well, a disc brake system can safely bring a saloon car to a stop while providing years of reliable service.
