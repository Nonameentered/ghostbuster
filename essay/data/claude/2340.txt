The difference in the use of superlative adjectives between the broadsheet newspaper The Guardian and tabloid The Mirror is evident in their coverage and reporting on the death of former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. Superlative adjectives, meaning words that imply the supreme quality of something, are employed more frequently and extremely in The Mirror's coverage compared to The Guardian's. This reflects the contrasting styles and intended audiences of the two publications.  

The Guardian, as a broadsheet newspaper, adopts a more formal and restrained writing style in its coverage of Kennedy's death. Its obituary of Kennedy utilizes superlative adjectives sparingly and couches them in a detached and objective tone. Kennedy is described as "one of the most gifted parliamentary orators of his generation" who "at his peak...was the most popular party leader in Britain." These superlatives are qualified and balanced. While recognizing Kennedy's talents and skills, The Guardian avoids extremes of language and hyperbole. Its overall obituary adopts a respectful yet composed reflection on Kennedy's complex legacy and career.

In contrast, The Mirror employs superlative adjectives in an effusive and emotive manner. Kennedy is frequently referred to as "brilliant" with headlines describing him as "The People's Politician" and "The Kindest MP." The adjective "great" is used liberally, with Kennedy praised as "one of Britain's greatest political talents and finest public speakers." These extreme superlatives are not qualified or balanced as in The Guardian. They contribute to anoverall style and tone of idealization and celebration of Kennedy's life that aims to pull at the heartstrings and generate pathos in readers. The Mirror makes frequent use of hyperbolic and superlative language throughout its coverage to paint Kennedy in an almost saintly light.

In conclusion, the use of superlative adjectives in the coverage of Charles Kennedy's death highlights the distinction in writing style, language, and intended audience between the broadsheet and tabloid newspapers. The Guardian employs superlatives judiciously and frames them within a detached and reasoned analysis, while The Mirror uses them sweepingly and emotively to craft a moving yet exaggerated portrait of Kennedy as a ''great'' figure. The contrast reflects the respective journalistic standards and reader bases of the publications. Overall, the level of superlatives and language in news reporting can reveal much about a publication's character and priorities.
