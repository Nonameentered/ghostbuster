Conglomerate mergers refer to mergers between firms that do not have a direct competitive relationship, as they operate in separate product markets or geographic markets. Under Article 2 of the EC Merger Regulation, the European Commission has the power to review "concentrations" between undertakings that meet certain thresholds to determine their compatibility with the common market. The review of conglomerate mergers aims to assess whether they may "significantly impede effective competition" in the European Community or in a substantial part of it.  

The European Commission's concern with conglomerate mergers stems from their potential anti-competitive effects, such as the "portfolio effect" and the risk of "leveraging". The portfolio effect refers to the possibility that the merged entity may bundle or tie products from the merging firms to gain a competitive advantage, foreclosing the market to competitors. Leveraging refers to the possibility that the merged firm may use its dominant position in one market to strengthen its position in another related market by means such as tying, cross-subsidization or predatory pricing.

Prior to the Tetra Laval/Sidel case in 2002, the Commission took a relatively permissive stance towards conglomerate mergers, approving them unless a clear anti-competitive effect could be established. However, the General Court annulled the Commission's decision to block the Tetra Laval/Sidel merger, finding that the Commission had failed to definitively prove the alleged anti-competitive effects. This ruling prompted the Commission to adopt a stricter approach to conglomerate mergers going forward.

The Commission's stricter stance after Tetra Laval was criticized by the CFI in later cases such as Thomson/Polygram and Sony/BMG, where the CFI found that the high evidentiary standards for conglomerate mergers had not been met. The CFI noted that while potential anti-competitive effects were raised as theoretical possibilities, definitive conclusions on harm to competition could not be drawn. The CFI thus took the view that stronger evidence of a likely anti-competitive effect was needed to prohibit a conglomerate merger.

In conclusion, conglomerate mergers have been the subject of diverging interpretations by the European Commission and the CFI. The Commission has expressed concern about potential anti-competitive effects from these mergers but has faced difficulty proving likely harm under the high standards of proof established by the CFI and expected for intervention in a sphere close to undertakings' freedom of economic activity. Overall, a balanced approach that addresses substantiated concerns without hampering efficiency-generating business alliances may be optimal. The resolution of differences between the Commission and the CFI is important to provide guidance on the standards of proof and the characterization of conglomerate mergers under EC law.
