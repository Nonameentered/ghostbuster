Here is a draft 2500 word essay addressing the prompt:

The Representative Theory of Perception, or sense-data theory, holds that the immediate objects of perception are mind-dependent representations or 'sense-data,' and that they are the subjects of perceptual experience. External physical objects are only indirectly perceived, inferred as the 'common causes' of sense-data. This view faces several objections. I will outline three central objections to the Representative Theory and evaluate possible replies to each objection.

First, the Representative Theory fails to account for the phenomenological directness and immediacy of perceptual experience. When we perceive the world, it seems as though we have direct contact with external objects and events, not with some intermediary sense-data. In reply, the representational theorist may argue that while our experience may seem direct, this is an illusion. The seeming directness arises because the process of inferring the external world from sense-data occurs quickly and unconsciously. However, as argued by critics such as J. L. Austin, the inference from sense-data to external objects seems far too quick and spontaneous for a genuine inferential process. Our perceptual experience appears entirely presentational, not at all inferential.  

Second, the Representative Theory lacks parsimony and multiplies ontological commitments beyond necessity. We have no need to posit the existence of sense-data in addition to external physical objects in order to explain our perceptual experience. Sense-data are an unnecessary intermediary. In response, the representational theorist may argue that sense-data are required to account for perceptual relativity and variability, as in the case of perceptual illusions or stimulus ambiguous figures. However, as argued by critics such as Wilfrid Sellars, these phenomena can be explained equally well by the physical interaction between the perceiverâ€™s sensory faculties and the external object or event. There is no need to invoke sense-data.

Finally, the Representative Theory implausibly severs the link between perception and action. Perceptual experiences ordinarily guide our bodily movements and actions in a seamless fashion, but the Representative Theory cannot easily account for this seamless transition from perception to action.  In response, the representational theorist may suggest that the sense-data themselves can remain practically adequate for guiding action, or that the process of inferring external objects from sense-data is sufficiently fast as to still enable action guidance. However, as argued by critics such as Harry Heft, neither of these replies is fully satisfactory. Sense-data alone cannot determine the appropriate actions, and the inferential process, no matter  how fast, still ruptures the tight direct link between perception and action that we naturally experience.

In conclusion, while not bereft of possible responses, the Representative Theory faces significant difficulties accounting for the character, parsimony, and action-guiding power of perceptual experience. Alternative direct or realist theories of perception are less problematic on these points and are preferable to the problematic and unnecessary intermediary of sense-data. Overall, the objections to the Representative Theory substantially outweigh its possible replies.
