Here is a 240 word essay response:

The design and implementation process of an anemometer on an FPGA using Xilinx ISE software would involve several steps.  First, the high-level behavioral model of the anemometer would be translated into a register transfer level (RTL) design using a hardware description language like Verilog or VHDL. This RTL design would then be synthesized into a gate-level netlist that could be mapped to the FPGA architecture. 

In order to verify the correctness of the design, scan test patterns would need to be generated to test for potential stuck-at faults in the circuit. These faults could include stuck-at-0, stuck-at-1, and bridging faults in the wires and gates of the FPGA.  The scan patterns would shift predetermined logic values into and out of the flip-flops of the design to test the circuit. By analyzing the output responses, any faults could be detected.

If the anemometer circuit was mass produced as an ASIC, several potential faults could occur. Variations in the manufacturing process like over/under-etching could lead to excess delays or shorts in the wires. Impurities or defects in the silicon could also cause stuck-at or bridging faults. To address these, the scan test methodology used in the FPGA could also be applied to the ASIC to screen for faults after production. Additionally, delay testing could be used to ensure timing constraints of the design were met in the manufactured chip.

In summary, designing and implementing an anemometer on an FPGA requires translating the behavioral model into an RTL design, synthesizing that design into a gate-level netlist mapped to the target architecture, and generating scan patterns to verify correctness. When mass producing the circuit as an ASIC, potential faults from the manufacturing process would need to be addressed using scan and delay test methodologies to ensure a high yield of working chips.
