How did individual goals and interests within the International Service for National Agricultural Research (ISNAR) affect the organization's goals and activities? What were the impacts of external market interactions on the organization's survival? Analyze the goals, structure, and culture of ISNAR during the period of 2001-2004, including the organization's re-structuring phase and closure, using this case study to determine the effectiveness of organizations and their relationship to human behavior:

Individual goals and interests played a significant role in shaping the goals and activities of the International Service for National Agricultural Research (ISNAR) from 2001 to 2004. Although ISNAR's stated mission was to strengthen the capacities of agricultural research institutions and national systems, individual priorities within the organization often diverged from this aim. The directors and program leaders had broad discretion in how program funds were spent and which initiatives were adopted. This resulted in a wide variety of small, short-term projects that were hard to effectively monitor.

The internal politics and dynamics between ISNAR leadership also contributed to shifts in priorities. For example, when a new director came in 2003, he restructured ISNAR and cut many programs in favor of a narrower focus on supporting the role of agricultural research in addressing global poverty reduction. This dramatic shift shows how significantly ISNAR's activities relied upon the priorities of its leadership at any given time. The frequent leadership turnover, with four directors between 2000 and 2004, meant that ISNAR struggled to settle on a consistent strategic vision and set of activities to align with its mission. 

External market forces and interactions also greatly impacted ISNAR's survival during this period. ISNAR was highly dependent on donor funding from organizations like the World Bank, DFID, CIDA, and others. When donor priorities changed or funding levels fluctuated, ISNAR lacked a stable source of core funding to maintain operations. Following severe budget cuts in 2003, ISNAR struggled to find new sources of funding and was ultimately unable to survive, announcing its closure in 2004. ISNAR's reliance on short-term, donor-driven projects and lack of a consistent set of programs or activities made it difficult to build a compelling case for continued funding and support.

In summary, individual goals, leadership dynamics, and external funding changes significantly impacted ISNAR's goals, activities, and ultimately its survival between 2001 and 2004. The frequent changes in leadership and lack of a strong strategic vision meant that ISNAR struggled to develop a coherent set of priorities and programs. And without a diversified funding base or core set of long-term donors, ISNAR was unable to withstand disruptions in external funding. This case study highlights how organizational effectiveness depends upon aligning individual interests and priorities, establishing a consistent strategic direction, and limiting reliance on unstable external factors like short-term donor funding. Overall, ISNAR's experience shows the significant influence of human behavior and relationships on organizational outcomes.
