Computational Fluid Dynamics, or CFD, is the process of simulating fluid flow problems using numerical analysis and data structures. CFD allows engineers to model complex flow behaviors and interactions of liquids and gases accurately.  Different CFD techniques are applied depending on the industry and type of fluid flow problem. Some common sectors that utilize CFD include aerospace, automotive, biomedical, chemical, civil engineering, power generation, and oil industries.  

The fundamental principle behind CFD is solving the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of viscous fluids. There are three main methods for solving these complex partial differential equations: the finite difference method, the finite volume method, and the finite element method. The finite difference method solves simplified versions of the Navier-Stokes equations at discrete points on a grid. The finite volume method also solves the equations on a grid but uses integral forms to calculate flux over cell volumes. Finally, the finite element method solves the weak form of the equations using piecewise functions. 

A common CFD software used in industry is ANSYS CFX. The basic CFX process begins with creating the geometry and meshing the model. Meshing involves dividing the geometry into small cells that make up a grid system. Clustering more cells close to walls and boundaries, known as boundary layer inflation, is important for capturing flow details accurately. The mesh and flow physics profiles are then processed using a selected solver like the coupled multigrid solver. 

Boundary conditions describe the flow into and out of the domain. Choices include mass flow inlets and exits, pressure inlets and exits, slip walls, and periodic boundary conditions. Initial conditions represent the flow field at the start of the simulation before the inlet flow develops. The solution is then computed through an iterative process that continues until the results converge and the residuals flatten out. 

As an example, let's walk through creating and meshing a basic static mixer geometry in CFX. A static mixer consists of periodic baffles in a pipe to continuously blend fluids. We construct a pipe with an inlet and outlet, then place a series of baffles inside at equal spacing. To capture the flow around the baffles accurately, we refine the mesh by using the Inflation tool to apply 5 prism layers with a growth factor of 1.2 near wall boundaries. This concentrates more cells close to walls where the flow changes rapidly. We also set the maximum cell size to 5% of the baffle width to achieve a high resolution. Using these techniques will generate an optimized mesh to solve the flow in our static mixer model precisely.

In summary, CFD is a powerful tool used to simulate fluid flows and gain insight into complex flow behaviors using numerical methods. Different techniques like mesh refinement and solver settings allow engineers to build accurate models of flow systems. CFD finds application in a wide range of industries for improving designs and solving flow-related challenges.
