Here is a draft 2500-word essay in response to the prompt:

Ethnomethodology is an approach to sociology that challenges traditional ways of studying social norms and interaction. Rather than focusing on social structures and forces as explanatory factors for social order, ethnomethodology examines the methods and practices that people use in their everyday interactions to construct and negotiate social realities. Ethnomethodologists argue that social norms and meanings emerge from the interactions between individuals, not from predetermined rules that govern behavior. 

A seminal ethnomethodological study that illustrates this perspective is D. Lawrence Wieder’s 1974 examination of “the code” in a rehabilitative center for paroled narcotic addicts. Wieder investigated how residents collectively developed and enforced informal rules of behavior to govern life in the center. Instead of attributing the code to administrative policy or societal values, Wieder showed how it arose from the residents’ own interpretations and negotiations in everyday interactions.

The code specified proper ways for residents to speak, act, and relate to each other so as to demonstrate their rehabilitation. For instance, residents were not supposed to talk about life outside the center or dwell on the past. They had to show deference to staff and enthusiasm for the center’s regimen. However, the code was not explicitly taught but rather learned through experience. New residents had to figure out the code by observing interactions and then practicing it, with corrections from other residents if they deviated from the norm.

Wieder found that enforcement of the code was also achieved through social interaction and interpretation, not by decree from administrators. Residents themselves monitored each other for infractions and negotiated acceptable behavior. Enforcement varied in strictness based on residents’ assessments of each other’s sincerity in following the rules. Some rule-breaking was tolerated if residents showed genuine commitment to rehabilitation in other ways.

The study illustrates how ethnomethodology provides insight into the ongoing construction of social norms through interaction...
