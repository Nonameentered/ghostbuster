There are several methods for calculating the natural frequencies of a restrained plate. The first is the analytical method which uses the classical plate theory to solve the governing differential equation for the plate vibration. This results in the characteristic frequency equation which relates the frequency to the stiffness, mass, and boundary conditions of the plate. 

The second method is the finite element method (FEM) which discretizes the plate into a mesh of elements. The vibration of the entire plate is analyzed by solving the vibration of each element. The denseness of the mesh or the matrix density affects the accuracy of the results, with a finer mesh typically producing more accurate results but requiring more computational resources to solve. For plates with regular geometries and uniform material properties, a coarse mesh may be sufficient for preliminary analysis. For complex geometries or non-homogeneous plates, a fine mesh is needed for precise frequency calculations.

The third method is experimental modal analysis where the actual plate is excited by an impact hammer or shaker. Vibration sensors measure the dynamic response which is then used to estimate the natural frequencies and mode shapes. This validation of analytical or FEM results is important for real-world structures. However, sufficient measurement points are needed to capture the global behavior of the entire plate.

 In summary, while analytical and FEM methods can calculate the natural frequencies of a plate, experimental modal analysis is needed for physical validation. The choice of method and the matrix density or measurement points depends on the complexity of the plate and the level of accuracy required. With the advanced computing power today, detailed FEM analyses with fine discretization are more feasible for complex cases where high accuracy is imperative.
