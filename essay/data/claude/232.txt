Stabilisation policy refers to the government's attempts to modify the peaks and troughs of the business cycle through monetary and fiscal policy. While stabilisation policy has the potential to reduce the severity of economic fluctuations, its effectiveness is limited in practice due to uncertainties, time lags, and disagreements among policymakers and economists. 

Monetary policy involves the central bank manipulating interest rates and the money supply to influence aggregate demand in the economy. Lower interest rates make it cheaper for households and businesses to borrow money, encouraging spending and investment. Higher rates have the opposite effect. However, the effectiveness of monetary policy is limited by uncertain time lags between policy changes and their impact on the real economy. It can take 6-24 months for the full effects of a change in interest rates to feed through, by which time the economic circumstances may have changed. Policy changes also risk exacerbating fluctuations if mistimed.

Fiscal policy refers to changes in government spending and taxation to impact aggregate demand. During a recession, governments can increase spending or cut taxes to stimulate demand and output. The reverse is true during high growth. However, fiscal policy changes can take even longer to implement due to political processes. There are also debates around the size and duration of deficit spending. While government intervention may be necessary during crises, persistent budget deficits and high debt levels can pose risks to long-term growth. 

There are also disagreements among economists on the appropriate role and scope of stabilisation policy. Followers of Keynesian economics argue that government intervention is necessary to maintain economic stability and full employment. In contrast, proponents of the efficient markets hypothesis believe that government intervention will lead to inefficient resource allocation and moral hazard. There are also debates around rules-based versus discretionary policymaking.

In practice, most governments adopt a balanced approach, using policy to temper the peaks and troughs of the business cycle but within limits. Strong, timely intervention may have been necessary during the Global Financial Crisis, but policymakers must be wary of overreach that distorts markets or leads to problematic deficit or debt levels. Overall, while stabilisation policy has the potential to effectively smooth economic fluctuations, there are substantial uncertainties and risks that constrain its impact. Policy changes require prudent design and timing to achieve the desired economic outcomes.
