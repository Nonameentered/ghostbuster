Here is a draft 500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Experiments were conducted to measure various density properties of apples, potatoes, peas and dried milk powder. The first property measured was particle density, which is the density of the solid material in the particles. This was measured by submerging a known mass of the sample in water or liquid and measuring the volume of the displaced liquid. 

For apples and potatoes, the particle density was found to be around 1.5 g/cm3. For peas, the particle density was 1.3 g/cm3. And for dried milk powder, the particle density was 1.56 g/cm3. These values represent the density of the solid cellular material in these samples.

The second property measured was bulk density, which is the density of the sample including the spaces between particles. This was measured by weighing a known volume of the sample. For apples and potatoes, the bulk density was around 0.5-0.7 g/cm3, significantly less than the particle density. For peas, the bulk density was 0.68 g/cm3. And for dried milk powder, the bulk density was 0.52 g/cm3. The bulk densities are lower because the samples also contain air spaces between the particles.

The third property measured was porosity, which is the fraction of empty space in the total volume. Porosity was calculated from the particle density and bulk density using the formula: Porosity = (Particle Density â€“ Bulk Density) / Particle Density. The porosities were found to be around 50-70% for the tested samples. Apples and potatoes had higher porosities, around 60-70%, indicating they have more empty space. Peas had a porosity of around 48% and dried milk powder had a porosity of around 66%.

In conclusion, experiments measuring particle density, bulk density and porosity found that apples, potatoes and dried milk powder have significant amounts of empty space, around 50-70% of their total volumes. Peas were slightly more dense, with a porosity of 48%. Particle densities ranged from 1.3-1.56 g/cm3, while bulk densities were 0.52-0.7 g/cm3. These types of measurements help determine physical properties of particulate materials.
