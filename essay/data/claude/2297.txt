Here is a draft 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

Organic farming refers to agricultural practices done without the use of synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. It relies on crop rotation, compost, and natural pest control methods instead of artificial agricultural chemicals. Proponents argue that organic farming is more environmentally-friendly and produces healthier and safer food. However, critics argue that organic farming is less efficient and sustainable, and there is little evidence that organic food is significantly more nutritious.

The core principles of organic farming include using naturally occurring fertilizers and pest control, diversifying crop rotation, and avoiding genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Organic farmers use compost and manure as natural fertilizers and rotate crops to improve soil fertility and pest control. They also avoid the use of synthetic pesticides and instead rely on natural pest predators, crop diversity, and other ecological strategies for pest management. As a result, organic farming avoids the pollution caused by chemicals and runoff from conventional farming. It encourages biodiversity and healthy, fertile soil that sustains plant growth without artificial stimulation. 

However, organic farming is often less efficient than conventional farming. Crop yields are typically 20-50% lower for organic farming. More land is required to produce the same amount of food, so organic farming may accelerate deforestation if adopted on a large scale. Organic produce also requires more manual labor for weed and pest control, and it is more expensive to produce due to higher costs. As a result, organic food is more expensive for consumers and less profitable for farmers.

There is little evidence that organic food is significantly more nutritious. Some studies show slightly higher amounts of certain nutrients like antioxidants in organic produce, but the nutritional differences are negligible for most people. Organic food is not inherently safer, either. Although organic produce has lower pesticide residue, natural pesticides and pathogens can still contaminate food and organic standards do not include food safety criteria. Proper handling and hygiene have a much greater impact on food safety than the use of organic methods.

In conclusion, while organic farming does have environmental and sustainability benefits over conventional farming, it is not a perfect solution. It requires trade-offs in efficiency, cost, and food production. There are pros and cons to both organic and conventional agriculture. A balanced perspective that incorporates the best of both approaches may be the optimal solution to producing affordable, nutritious, and environmentally-friendly food for our growing global population. Overall, more research is still needed to determine if and how organic farming can contribute to sustainable food production.
