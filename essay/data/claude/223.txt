How Does Neural Development Constrain Cognitive Development During Critical Periods? 

Cognitive development, the development of mental abilities such as problem solving, reasoning, and language, is shaped by the growth and organization of the brain during early life.  The neural connections and pathways in our brain undergo rapid development for a finite window of time, known as critical periods.  During these critical periods, the brain is highly sensitive and responsive to environmental input and experiences.  Interactions with the environment help shape how neural connections are formed and organized in the brain.  Once these critical periods end, the brain loses much of its plasticity, making it more difficult to change neural pathways.  

Because cognitive development is built upon the neural structures and connections formed during critical periods, the timing and experiences during these periods place constraints on cognitive development.  Three key ways neural development during critical periods shapes cognitive development are through sensitive periods for learning language, development of visual perception, and development of cognitive control and reasoning.

First, the ability to learn language is constrained by a critical period for language acquisition in infancy and early childhood.  During the first few years of life, the brain is primed for learning language.  Neural pathways are formed to recognize, process, and produce the sounds of native languages.  If language input does not occur during this time, it becomes much harder to learn language.  For example, children who are not exposed to language early, such as "wild children" or those with severe neglect or abuse, often struggle to fully acquire language.  The neural pathways for fluent language use were not established during the critical period.  

Visual perception also develops during a critical period in infancy.  Neural pathways for various aspects of vision, such as binocular vision, form and strengthen based on environmental input during early development.  If vision in one eye is deprived early in life, the pathways for binocular vision weaken or fail to form, leading to impaired depth perception.  Other visual abilities like pattern perception also require environmental input during critical periods to develop typically.  Without these early experiences, visual-spatial cognitive abilities may be permanently impacted.

Finally, higher-level cognitive abilities like reasoning, problem solving, and cognitive control have sensitive periods that extend into adolescence.  The prefrontal cortex, responsible for these abilities, continues developing throughout childhood and adolescence.  Neural connections are shaped by interactions and experiences, as well as die off if unused.  For example, if a child lacks opportunities to develop reasoning or problem-solving skills during development, the neural pathways underlying those cognitive processes will not organize in a typical fashion.  The child may have difficulties acquiring those skills later in life.  

In conclusion, critical periods in neural development place constraints on the emergence and maturation of cognitive abilities.  Sensitive periods for learning language, developing visual perception, and improving reasoning and cognitive control abilities all require environmental input and interaction to shape neural pathways in a typical manner.  Without these experiences during critical periods, cognitive development can be permanently impaired.  Thus, cognitive development is not purely the unfolding of innate potential, but rather the product of interactions between the developing neural system and the environment during key periods of sensitivity.
