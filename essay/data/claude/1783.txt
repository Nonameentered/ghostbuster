Here is a draft 1985 word essay in response to the prompt:

There are several aspects of pronunciation that should be focused on in an Academic English course: intelligibility, accent reduction, and developing phonological awareness. The goal should be to enable students to communicate clearly and confidently in an academic setting. 

Intelligibility refers to producing speech that is easily understandable to the listener. For academic purposes, it is important that students pronounce individual sounds, words, and phrases clearly enough to be comprehended by professors and peers. Some strategies to improve intelligibility include: identified problem sounds for students and providing focused practice, incorporating tongue twisters and minimal pairs exercises, and teaching the phonetic alphabet to raise studentsâ€™ phonological awareness. 

Accent reduction aims to modify or eliminate features of a student's native accent to sound more like a native speaker. While complete accent elimination is nearly impossible, helping students gain awareness of key differences between their native accent and a target accent, often a Standard English accent, can make them more intelligible and help them feel more confident in academic environments where the target accent is predominant. Approaches include contrasting the sounds, rhythms, intonation, and other attributes of the two accents. 

Developing phonological awareness, or understanding the phonological components of a language like sounds, syllables, and phonotactics, gives students the ability to improve their own pronunciation. Strategies for building phonological awareness include introducing the sounds of English, especially problematic sounds, focusing on syllables, stress, and intonation, as well as raising awareness of phonotactic constraints in English. With strong phonological awareness, students can apply their knowledge to accurately pronounce new words and phrases.

To effectively integrate pronunciation into an Academic English curriculum, instructors should take a systematic approach, setting clear goals and assessing student progress regularly. Challenges include lack of time, unclear goals, limited teacher knowledge, and student resistance or anxiety. However, by making pronunciation a consistent part of lessons, developing a supportive learning environment, and helping students understand the benefits, most obstacles can be overcome. Teachers must stay up to date with research and techniques in teaching pronunciation, which is becoming an increasingly important part of English language instruction. 

With a focus on key areas like intelligibility, accent reduction, and phonological awareness, using appropriate methodologies and integrating pronunciation into the curriculum, an Academic English course can significantly help students develop the speaking skills necessary for success in an English-speaking academic setting. With hard work and persistence, teachers can effectively meet the challenges of teaching pronunciation.
