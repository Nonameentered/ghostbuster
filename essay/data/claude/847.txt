Mathematical models provide a useful means of predicting deflection behavior due to bending and torsion loads. However, the accuracy of such models depends on the assumptions and approximations made in their derivation. Simple linear elastic models based on Bernoulli-Euler beam theory and Saint-Venant’s theory of torsion provide a first approximation for calculating deflections. However, these models make several assumptions that result in limitations on their accuracy.

The Bernoulli-Euler model for beam bending assumes a linear elastic material, small deflections, cross-sections that remain flat, and a pure bending state with no shear stresses. These assumptions allow for a simple model where the bending moment is proportional to the curvature, but they limit the model’s application to large deformations and neglect shear deflections. Saint-Venant’s torsion model similarly assumes a linear elastic material, small angles of twist, and a pure torsion state where warping is constrained. The predicted deflection varies linearly with torque, but the model is limited by its assumptions.

Experimental data from beam bending and torsion rigs demonstrate that while these simple models can approximate deflections under some conditions, there are deviations from the theoretical predictions due to the approximations involved. For larger loads that produce greater deflections, geometric nonlinearities cause the beam to undergo unanticipated deformations that the linear models do not capture. Factors like shear deflections, warping, and material nonlinearities also contribute to differences between the experimental data and linear model predictions.

In conclusion, mathematical models provide a useful starting point for understanding deflection behavior under bending and torsion loads. However, the underlying assumptions of linearity and small deformations limit their ability to accurately capture the full behavior. More complex models that address geometric and material nonlinearities, shear effects, warping, and other variables more closely correspond with physical experimental results. For precise calculation and modeling of deflections, these advanced models should be employed rather than relying solely on simple linear theory.
