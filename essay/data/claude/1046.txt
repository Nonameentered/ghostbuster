Immanuel Kant and Edmund Burke both wrote influential essays in the 18th century exploring the sublime, an experience of awe and transcendence in the face of immense power. However, their concepts of the sublime differed in key ways. For Burke, the sublime arises from a feeling of fear and danger, while for Kant, the sublime is evoked by the mind's ability to transcend its own limitations. 

Burke's 1757 essay "A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful" argued that experiences of pain, fear, and terror can produce sublime effects. Burke saw the sublime as an aesthetic experience that arises when one encounters something infinitely more powerful than oneself, like a raging storm, towering mountain, or force of nature. These encounters make us aware of our own physical limitations and vulnerability. We experience a terrifying thrill, but also a pleasure in knowing we are safe. For Burke, the sublime gives rise to a tension between fear and delight. The fear humbles us, while the delight arises from realizing we can experience fear without real threat.

In contrast, Kant's 1790 "Critique of Judgment" defined the sublime as arising not from physical threat, but from the mind's ability to transcend its own limitations. For Kant, the sublime is evoked by infinite or incomprehensible objects, like the starry night sky. When confronted with the infinite, the mind strains to comprehend what far outstrips its faculties. Yet in this straining, the mind discovers its own supersensible power. It realizes it has the power of reason to think infinity, even if it cannot fully grasp infinity in perception or imagination. For Kant, "the sublime moves, the beautiful charms." The sublime expands the mind, giving rise to a feeling of transcendence and spiritual exaltation.

Kant's theory of the sublime is more amenable to experiences of art than Burke's. Burke's sublime depends on real feelings of danger and fear, which are hard to evoke in audiences through art. But Kant's sublime arises from the mind's own powers of comprehension and reason. Artworks that suggest infinity, transcendence, or spiritual exaltation can elicit Kant's sublime by prompting the mind to become aware of its own supersensible faculties. 

For example, artworks that depict dramatic landscapes, outer space, or religious and mystical themes often aim to evoke the Kantian sublime. Paintings like Caspar David Friedrich's "Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog" or contemporary artworks like Olafur Eliasson's massive light installations give viewers a sense of confronting the infinite, allowing their minds to expand and transcend in Kant's terms. 

In conclusion, while Burke and Kant's concepts of the sublime differed in their emphasis on fear versus reason, Kant's notion of the sublime is more relevant for understanding art. Kant showed how the sublime arises not from physical threat, but from the mind's confrontation with its own limits and ability to transcend those limits. This provides a compelling framework for how artworks can use themes of infinity, transcendence and spiritual reflection to create a sublime experience in audiences. Overall, Kant's sublime emerges as the more profound and resonant theory, giving insight into one of the most compelling experiences art can evoke.
