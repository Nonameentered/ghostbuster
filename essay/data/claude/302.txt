The "first generation" model of balance of payments crises refers to the seminal theoretical framework developed by economist Paul Krugman in 1979. Krugman developed an open economy macroeconomic model within which he explored how inconsistencies in macroeconomic policies can lead to balance of payments crises. In the first generation model, a balance of payments crisis refers to a situation in which a country cannot meet its obligation to maintain a stable exchange rate because it has depleted its foreign exchange reserves. 

In Krugman's model, the economy consists of two sectors—the domestic sector which consumes domestic goods and the foreign sector which consumes foreign goods. The domestic sector operates with adaptive expectations, meaning economic agents form expectations about the future based on currently available information. The economy also has a fixed exchange rate, meaning the central bank pegs the domestic currency at a constant rate to a foreign currency (typically the USD).

There are two macroeconomic policy instruments in the model: fiscal policy which determines the level of government spending, and monetary policy which determines the money supply. An inconsistency arises when the government adopts an expansionary fiscal policy by increasing spending, but keeps the money supply unchanged to maintain the exchange rate target. The increased aggregate demand leads to a balance of payments deficit as more is spent on imports. However, because the money supply is unchanged, the overall money demand does not increase. This inconsistency causes domestic interest rates to rise and attract capital inflows, but the capital inflows cannot finance the larger deficit indefinitely. 

Eventually, as the deficit persists and depletes foreign reserves, the fixed exchange rate becomes unsustainable—this is known as a speculative attack, which marks the onset of a balance of payments crisis. To defend the exchange rate, the central bank raises interest rates even higher, causing a recession. But if the deficit does not improve, the country will run out of foreign reserves, the exchange rate collapses and a crisis emerges.

The key limitations of the first generation model include its simplistic assumptions of adaptive expectations and fixed exchange rates. It also does not fully explain the timing of crises, which can seem random. Extensions were developed to address these issues, including models with rational expectations and floating exchange rates. There is significant empirical evidence that supports the first generation model, including experiences of balance of payments crises in developed countries during the postwar gold standard. However, the model does not capture the experiences of emerging market crises in the 1990s and after, suggesting further extensions are needed.

In summary, the first generation model provides a seminal macroeconomic framework for understanding balance of payments crises caused by inconsistent macroeconomic policies. While limited in scope, it helps explain how such policies can inevitably lead to crises, and has gained support from historical experiences of developed countries under fixed exchange rates. More advanced models have built upon it, but it remains a pivotal early framework in open economy macroeconomics.
