Should developing countries adopt exploitative foreign direct investment (FDI) through export processing zones (EPZs), and what are the long-term economic and social consequences of such a strategy?

Developing countries are often eager to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) and export-oriented manufacturing as a path to economic growth and job creation. Export processing zones (EPZs) are designated areas where foreign companies can operate with tax incentives and minimal regulation. While EPZs can generate economic activity and employment in the short term, developing countries should exercise caution adopting an EPZ model that relies on cheap labor and poor working conditions. Such an exploitative model can have damaging long-term economic and social consequences. 

On the economic front, an EPZ model based primarily on providing cheap labor to multinational corporations does not support the development of higher-value, innovative industries in the host country. Foreign companies are incentivized to keep operations limited to low-skilled assembly and production work. They frequently import materials and components, and then export the final products overseas. Little value addition or technological spillover occurs in the local economy. This limits the growth of indigenous industries and a middle class of skilled workers and consumers. If foreign companies decide at any point to relocate operations elsewhere with even lower costs, the economic gains can evaporate quickly. 

Socially, exploitative EPZs often involve poor treatment of workers including low wages, long working hours, absence of job security, restrictions on unionization, and hazardous conditions. While workers may have little choice but to accept such jobs in the short term due to lack of better options, this undermines human development in the long run. Health, educational, and economic outcomes suffer for the workforce as a whole. Inequality rises between EPZ workers and others in the formal and informal sectors of the economy. When basic worker rights and protections are not prioritized, it signals that human dignity is a secondary concern in the overall development agenda.

A “race to the bottom” to attract foreign capital at all costs frequently ends poorly for developing countries. Governments may feel pressured to undercut regulation and oversight to an extent that ultimately harms their citizens and future competitiveness. It is difficult to transition from an economy primarily based on cheap labor assembly to more advanced sectors. While some level of FDI and export orientation may be beneficial, developing countries should focus on attracting high-quality investment aligned with long term economic and social interests. They must insist on adherence to adequate labor and environmental standards. Channeling FDI into more technologically-intensive sectors with higher value addition is ideal. With the right regulation and support, EPZs can be structured to benefit both foreign companies and domestic economies. But the interests of vulnerable workers and marginalized groups should never be ignored for the sake of short term economic gains.

In conclusion, while FDI and export-oriented growth strategies hold promise, developing countries should avoid exploitative EPZ models that rely entirely on poor treatment of workers and limited value addition. Such "race-to-the-bottom" policies may generate temporary economic activity but end up damaging a country's long term economic potential and social fabric. With strategic management and regulation, EPZs can benefit foreign and domestic parties alike. But the dignity, welfare, and development of a nation's citizens should be the top priority guiding investment policy. Overall, developing countries must think critically about the kinds of FDI they aim to attract and shape policies to support the industries and workforce of tomorrow.
