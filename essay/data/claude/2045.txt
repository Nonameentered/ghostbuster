ISNAR, a division of the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), adopts an innovative learning approach in its adult education and capacity strengthening programs. ISNAR focuses on experiential and participatory learning that is highly contextualized to the needs and realities of participants. The programs are designed based on extensive needs assessment and aim to develop critical thinking skills that can be applied to solve complex real-world problems. 

However, ISNAR’s approach has been criticized on several fronts. First, the programs are often too short-term to create lasting change. The participatory methods, while engaging, may lack depth and rigor. The contextualized nature of the training also makes it difficult to evaluate and limits scalability. Critics argue for more standardized and theory-based curricula, longer and more structured programs, and stronger M&E systems.

There are a few suggestions for improving ISNAR’s approach. First, ISNAR could strengthen the theoretical foundations of its programs by incorporating established models of adult learning like andragogy. It could also balance participatory methods with expert input and lectures. Longer, multi-stage programs with opportunities for practice and feedback may have greater impact. Developing a standardized yet flexible curriculum and toolkit for different contexts can help scale the approach. Stronger M&E using control groups and longitudinal data is needed to assess long term effectiveness.

Professionals in short-term training need to recognize that while one-off workshops have limited impact, they can still meaningfully improve lives when integrated into a broader, long-term capacity strengthening approach. Short-term training is useful for raising awareness, sharing knowledge, and inspiring further learning. When combined with follow up, mentoring, and access to resources, short-term training can motivate lasting change.  

Trainers and donors should see capacity strengthening as an ongoing process, not an end goal achieved after a single workshop. They need to make long-term commitments to supporting organizational and professional development. With the right mindset and approach, short-term training can be an effective way to launch participants on a journey of continuous learning and progress. The key is following up after the training and maintaining engagement and relationships.

In summary, while ISNAR’s highly contextualized and participatory approach to short-term training is innovative, its programs could be strengthened through more rigorous curricula, longer duration, scaled toolkits, and stronger M&E systems. Professionals need to recognize that short-term training can significantly improve lives when integrated into a long-term, holistic capacity strengthening process. With follow up and ongoing support, short-term training programs can motivate lasting, meaningful change.
