A woman who has undergone a total colectomy and ileostomy would have had her entire large intestine removed and an ileostomy created, where the end of the small intestine is brought through the abdominal wall to form an opening to pass stool. Physically, she would pass loose or liquid stools through the stoma, needing to empty her pouch frequently. She is at higher risk of dehydration and fatigue due to frequency of bowel movements and potential loss of fluids and electrolytes. She would require dietary changes, avoiding foods that could block or irritate the stoma.

Psychologically and psychosexually, having an ileostomy can be difficult to adjust to. The presence of a stoma and need to wear an ostomy pouch can alter body image and self-esteem, and impact intimacy with partners. Depression and anxiety are common. Support from family and friends, as well as speaking to others with ostomies, can help address these challenges. Professional counseling or sex therapy may sometimes be required.

To manage depression, options include medication, counseling or psychotherapy, support groups to address feelings of isolation, and general self-care through nutrition, exercise, sleep, and stress management. Loved ones can provide empathy, affection and a listening ear. Healthcare professionals play an important role in screening for signs of depression and ensuring appropriate treatment and follow up.

This woman's needs include ostomy supplies, medication, hydration, and nutrition. Her entitlements could include insurance coverage for supplies, medication and therapies under disability benefits. As healthcare professionals, establishing a respectful and trusting relationship is key. Educating the woman and her support network about what to expect and how to manage challenges can help alleviate fears and anxieties. Focusing on her strengths and adjusting to a "new normal" can support improved coping and quality of life. Close monitoring, especially initially, and clear communication among all parties involved in her care can help anticipate issues and provide responsive support. Overall, a collaborative, holistic and compassionate approach will facilitate the best outcomes.
