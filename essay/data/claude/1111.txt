The theory of Natural Phonology, proposed by David Stampe in 1969, aims to explain the regular patterns found in children's speech as they learn the phonological system of their native language. According to Stampe, children have an innate predisposition to perceive and produce speech in certain ways. As they are exposed to the speech of adults around them, they gradually adapt their perception and production to match the native phonological system. However, this adaptation process takes time, and children go through a series of predictable phonological processes on their way to mastering adult speech.  

According to Natural Phonology, children initially perceive and produce speech based on a set of built-in phonological principles, such as preferring simple syllable structures, avoiding consonant clusters, and producing the most sonorant or salient consonants. These principles lead children to simplify the phonological forms they are exposed to in the speech of adults. For example, a child may produce "dog" as "gog" by deleting the initial consonant cluster. Or they may produce "bottle" as "baba" by reduplicating a simple CV syllable. Over time, children gradually abandon these simplifying principles in a predictable order as their perception and production adapts to the native language.

Stampe proposed several specific phonological processes to account for the patterns found in children's speech. These include processes like cluster reduction to simplify consonant sequences, final consonant deletion, weak syllable deletion, reduplication to avoid complex syllables, and consonant harmony where children produce consonants that are most similar in place or manner of articulation. The particular processes and the order in which a child abandons them depends on the native language. For example, final consonant deletion persists longer in English than in Italian.  Individual children also vary in the rate at which they progress through these stages. Some may bypass certain processes, while others may remain in a process longer. But the overall trend is for these processes to disappear gradually as the child's speech matches the adult phonological system.

In summary, Natural Phonology argues that children have an innate predisposition to perceive and produce speech in simple and highly sonorant forms. Regular phonological processes, like cluster reduction and reduplication, reflect these predispositions.  Over time, children adapt their speech to match the more complex phonological patterns of the native language as their perceptual and productive capacities mature. The theory of Natural Phonology provides a systematic way of characterizing the regularities found in phonological acquisition and explaining the gradual mastery of native language phonology.
