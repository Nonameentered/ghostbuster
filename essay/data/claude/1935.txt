Here is a 750-word essay in response to the prompt:

A monopoly exists when a single firm controls the entire supply of a good or service, as opposed to perfect competition where many small firms compete. Monopolies are less efficient than perfect competition because they usually produce less output and charge a higher price. The reason monopolies are inefficient is due to the existence of deadweight loss. 

Deadweight loss refers to the total loss of economic benefit to society from a monopoly's higher prices and lower output. At the monopoly's profit-maximizing price and quantity, the marginal benefit to consumers of an additional unit of the good is greater than the marginal cost to the producer of supplying it. But because the monopoly limits output to maximize its profits, these otherwise mutually beneficial transactions do not take place. The result is that consumers lose more benefit than producers gain, leading to a net loss for society.

In contrast, under perfect competition with many small firms, no single firm has control over the price. Each firm produces up to the point where marginal cost equals marginal benefit since they cannot affect the overall market price. The market reaches an equilibrium that maximizes total surplus - the combined benefit to both producers and consumers. There is no deadweight loss since all mutually beneficial transactions are realized. 

A monopoly could theoretically avoid creating deadweight loss through perfect price discrimination, where it charges each consumer the maximum price they are willing and able to pay. With first-degree price discrimination, the monopoly separates the market into different groups based on willingness to pay and sets a different optimal price for each group. This allows the monopoly to capture the entire consumer surplus as profit. Since output would be expanded until marginal cost equals each group's willingness to pay, deadweight loss would disappear. 

However, perfect price discrimination is difficult to achieve in reality. It requires the monopoly to have comprehensive information about consumers' maximum willingness to pay and the ability to prevent resale of its product across groups. More commonly, monopolies use simpler forms of price discrimination like group pricing for students and seniors or peak pricing for high-demand periods. While these pricing strategies may reduce deadweight loss, some inefficiency usually remains compared to the perfectly competitive outcome.

In conclusion, monopolies are inefficient because they produce less and charge higher prices than under perfect competition. The deadweight loss caused by monopolies represents a loss of total economic surplus that reduces the overall benefit to society. Although monopolies can potentially eliminate deadweight loss through perfect price discrimination, feasibility constraints usually prevent them from achieving the efficient, perfectly competitive outcome.
