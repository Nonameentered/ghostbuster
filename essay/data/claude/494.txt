Nationalism has been an enormously influential force in recent centuries and shaped the modern world order of nation-states. However, nationalism also has significant moral flaws and downsides that threaten its longevity. Several factors fostered the rise of nationalism, including the spread of universal education, shared languages and cultures within nations, and opposition to external threats. These forces strengthened national identities and the desire for self-governance.  

At the same time, nationalism encourages an unhealthy tribalism and often irrational beliefs in one's nation's superiority. Nationalism has frequently led to conflict, oppression of minorities, and impediments to global cooperation. As the world becomes increasingly globalized and interdependent in the 21st century, nationalism's moral shortcomings may ultimately lead to its decline as a primary force in geopolitics. However, nationalism's roots run deep, and it will likely continue to shape events for decades to come.

Nationalism flourished starting in the 19th century due to several factors. First, the spread of universal public education meant that citizens could read and be exposed to ideas about their shared heritage and national identity. Second, the consolidation of common languages, especially through the proliferation of newspapers and novels, gave citizens a sense of shared culture. Third, external threats, especially wars, fostered solidarity against a common enemy. Nations that gained independence from multi-national empires were particularly keen to nurture national identities.

However, nationalism also has significant downsides that threaten its future influence. It often breeds unhealthy tribalism and beliefs that one's own nation is inherently superior to others. This can justify violence against minorities and lead to conflict between nations. Nationalism also impedes global cooperation on issues that transcend borders like climate change, weapons proliferation, and pandemics.

In the 21st century, globalization and worldwide connections may gradually erode the fervor of nationalism. However, for now, nationalism remains a potent force that continues to shape geopolitics. Leaders frequently stoke nationalist sentiments to gain popular support, even in democracies. While the moral flaws of nationalism are evident, as long as threats, shared identities, and a desire for self-governance endure, nationalism will likely persist for decades to come, for better and for worse. Its future beyond that period is uncertain and will depend on leaders promoting more global identities and cooperation. Nationalism shaped the modern world but may eventually outlive its usefulness if its tribalistic tendencies are not curbed.
