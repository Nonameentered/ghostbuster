Here is a draft essay in 1250 words on the declaratory theory of law and the doctrine of binding precedent:

The declaratory theory of law holds that judges do not make or create law but merely declare what the law is and has always been. In this view, judges are not lawmakers but are constrained to apply pre-existing law to the cases before them. The implications of this theory are that judges have a limited, passive role in the legal system as appliers of accepted law, rather than active lawmakers. 

The declaratory theory arose historically as a way to constrain judicial power and subjectivity. If judges were perceived as merely declaring accepted law and values rather than creating new law, their decisions would be seen as more objective and less open to judicial whim or bias. This theory was particularly important in common law systems like England's where much of the law was based on precedent from previous cases rather than a codified constitution or statute. By framing judges as declarers of accepted law rather than lawmakers, the declaratory theory helped legitimize the common law system.

The main advantage of the declaratory theory and its related doctrine of binding precedent is that it promotes consistency, stability, and predictability in the law. If judges are constrained to follow precedents from higher courts, people can rely on the law and extrapolate its future application. However, the theory has significant disadvantages, including its potential for obsolescence and rigidity. If social values change but judges feel strictly bound by precedent, the law may not keep up with the times. The declaratory theory can also hide the inherent subjectivity and choice involved in judicial decision making by framing choices as mere declarations of accepted law. 

In reality, though constrained by precedent and accepted principles, judges still shape the law through their interpretations and choices in applying precedent. They also bend or break from precedent at times to account for societal changes or better reasoned thinking. A strict declaratory theory is too simplistic and judges are now openly acknowledged as playing an important lawmaking role, along with legislators and others. However, the rhetoric of declaring accepted law still dominates judicial opinions as a way to legitimize decisions by tying them to the will of the people and not the personal views of judges.

In conclusion, while an outdated metaphor, the declaratory theory highlights the importance of precedent and accepted social values in common law systems. It has been fundamental to the Anglo-American tradition of judicial restraint and limited power. However, a strict version of the theory is no longer realistic or viable and should be seen more as an ideal than an absolute constraint on judicial decision making. Judges play an inextricable and important role in shaping and updating the law to match the evolving needs and values of society.
