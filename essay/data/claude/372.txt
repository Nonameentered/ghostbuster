There are a few possible reasons for the discrepancy between the calculated value of Planck's constant (h) using the photoelectric effect and the 2002 CODATA recommended value. The main reasons are:

1. Limitations in the experimental measurements and calculations used in the early 20th century to determine h from the photoelectric effect. The experiments and analyses at the time were groundbreaking but still subject to uncertainties and imperfections that could have led to incorrect values of h. For example, the work function of metals used was not accurately known, and the exact shape of the current-intensity curve as a function of frequency was difficult to determine precisely. These experimental limitations could have introduced uncertainties and errors into the calculation of h.

2. Lack of accounting for other effects like thermionic emission of electrons. The early photoelectric effect experiments aimed to isolate and study the light-induced emission of electrons. However, at high temperatures, electrons can be emitted from metals purely due to their thermal energy, even without light. If this thermionic emission was not properly accounted for, it may have contributed additional current that would lead to an incorrect value of h. Proper controls and measurements were needed to isolate the photoelectric effect. 

3. Use of now outdated theoretical frameworks and models. The experiments and analyses at the time were based on prevailing models of light and electrons that were still quite primitive. For example, the proton-based model of the atom instead of a nucleus and orbiting electrons. And the wave theory of light instead of the photon theory. These outdated frameworks may have led to improper interpretation of results and incorrect values of h.

Planck's constant was first calculated from the photoelectric effect by analyzing the relationship between the frequency of light shining on a metal surface and the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons. The kinetic energy (KE) of the emitted electrons can be measured, and is related to the frequency (f) of the light by the equation KE = hf - φ, where φ is the work function of the metal. By graphing KE vs. f for different frequencies of light, h can be calculated from the slope of the line.

However, the validity and accuracy of this approach depended on properly controlling experimental parameters and having a correct theoretical understanding of the photoelectric effect - which, as noted above, were not fully achieved in the early 20th century experiments. With technological and theoretical advances in the decades since, the 2002 CODATA value of h is likely to be more reliable and precise, explaining the discrepancy with the earlier photoelectric effect-based values. Improved experiments, more accurate measurements, theoretical developments like quantum electrodynamics, and the ability to precisely measure fundamental constants like the charge of an electron - all of these factors have allowed a far more accurate determination of Planck's constant in recent decades.

In summary, the likely reasons for discrepancies between early calculated values of h from the photoelectric effect and the modern 2002 CODATA recommended value are: 1) Limitations in early experimental measurements and analyses; 2) Failure to properly isolate and account for the photoelectric effect; and 3) Reliance on outdated theoretical models. With substantial advances, recent calculations of h are far more precise and reliable. This essay outlines how Planck's constant was first calculated using the photoelectric effect, and suggests multiple reasons why this early calculation yielded a value that differed from the modern recommended value.
