Multinational organizations expanding into international markets must consider various geographical and cultural factors when developing human resource strategies for their subsidiaries. Simply transplanting domestic HR policies to other countries often leads to unsuccessful internationalization efforts and poor employee relations. 

The Lakeside Group, a Canadian packaging company, is expanding into the Kenyan market. Kenya's hot climate and underdeveloped infrastructure present geographical challenges for Lakeside. Many cities experience frequent power outages, making it difficult to operate heavy machinery. Additionally, the poor road conditions make it inconvenient for employees to commute to work. Lakeside should adjust work hours and schedules based on local conditions as well as provide transportation stipends and on-site housing for employees. Adapting to the geography will make Lakeside an attractive employer and boost productivity.

There are also significant cultural differences that could impact Lakeside's people management approaches in Kenya. Kenyan society emphasizes hierarchy, respect, and harmony whereas Canadian culture focuses on egalitarianism and individualism. Therefore, Lakeside should implement a hierarchical organizational structure with clearly defined responsibilities to align with local cultural norms. Providing employees opportunities to socialize and build personal relationships will also foster harmony at work. 

Offering market-competitive compensation and good benefits is important but not sufficient for success in Kenya. Community engagement and corporate social responsibility are highly valued by Kenyans. Lakeside should actively contribute to community development by building infrastructure, funding education, supporting healthcare, and creating jobs. Integrating community needs into HR planning will establish Lakeside as a legitimate and beneficial presence, gaining goodwill and loyalty from employees and the local population.

In summary, multinational companies must tailor their HR strategies based on geographical factors and cultural values in international markets. For expansion into Kenya, Lakeside Group should address challenges posed by the climate and infrastructure, adapt to the hierarchical and relationship-oriented culture, and meet community needs. Implementing HR policies and practices that align with the local environment will allow Lakeside to overcome difficulties, gain talented employees, and achieve long-term success in Kenya. Careful consideration of key factors and recommendations provided in this essay will help Lakeside establish an effective people management approach for its Kenyan subsidiary.
