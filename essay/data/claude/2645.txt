To separate the components of a simulated pharmaceutical preparation that contains multiple compounds using physical and chemical properties, several precautions must be taken to ensure the accuracy and safety of the procedure. First, proper safety equipment such as goggles, gloves, and protective clothing should be worn at all times to avoid exposure to potentially hazardous substances. All separations should be performed in a well-ventilated area or under a fume hood. 

The physical properties that can be exploited for separation include solubility, boiling point, and melting point. To separate based on solubility, the mixture should be dissolved in a solvent and the resulting solution filtered to isolate the insoluble components. The filtrate can then be evaporated to isolate the soluble components. When separating based on boiling point, simple or fractional distillation apparatus can be used to isolate the components based on their different vaporization temperatures. 

For melting point separation, the mixture should be heated gradually while observing for the melting of components. As each component melts, it should be removed from the mixture. Care must be taken to avoid overheating, as this could damage some components. The temperature ranges at which each component melts should be recorded. These melting points can later be compared to reference standards to identify the isolated components.

Chemical properties that can be used for separation include acidity, basicity, and reactivity. For acid-base extraction, the mixture is dissolved in a solvent and mixed with both acid and base solutions to isolate the acidic, basic, and neutral components into separate solutions. The solutions are then evaporated to obtain the separated components. For separation by reactivity, components of the mixture may react differently with other reagents, allowing isolation of unreacted components. Care must be taken to avoid undesired side reactions.

The identities of the separated components can be determined using analytical techniques such as melting point and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The melting points of the separated components are compared against reference standards to identify potential matches. If a match is found, further confirmatory tests such as IR spectroscopy should be performed. For IR spectroscopy, a small amount of the separated component is analyzed, and the IR spectrum obtained is compared to a reference database to identify potential functional groups and confirm its identity.

In summary, by carefully exploiting the differences in physical and chemical properties of a multi-component pharmaceutical mixture, its individual constituents can be separated  in a controlled manner. Strict safety precautions must be followed to avoid exposure or undesired reactions. Analytical techniques such as melting point determination and IR spectroscopy can then be used to identify the separated components and confirm their identities.
