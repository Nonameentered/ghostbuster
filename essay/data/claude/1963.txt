Functions and Properties of Food Packaging Materials 

Food packaging serves several important functions. First, it protects the food from external contaminants such as microbes, moisture, and oxygen that can spoil the food or impact its safety. Second, packaging helps contain the food and makes it convenient to transport and distribute. Finally, packaging provides space for nutrition labels and is part of the overall marketing and branding of the food product.

To serve these functions effectively, food packaging materials must have certain key properties. They need to be impermeable to gases such as oxygen and moisture to prevent spoilage. They should also be chemically inert so they do not react with or leach into the food. Strength and puncture resistance are important for packaging to withstand physical stresses during transportation and storage. The materials should not have any odors that can be absorbed by the food. And the materials need to be food-grade and approved as safe for direct contact with food.

Several tests can be conducted to investigate these properties of food packaging materials. Oxygen transmission rate testing measures the permeability of the material to oxygen. This is important for packaging oxygen-sensitive foods like nuts, cured meats, and potato chips. Water vapor transmission rate testing similarly measures moisture permeability. Tensile strength testing investigates how much stress the material can withstand before breaking. This indicates whether the material is strong enough for its intended use. 

As an example, consider the properties of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic often used for food packaging. Oxygen transmission rate testing shows LDPE is highly impermeable to oxygen compared to many other plastics. Water vapor transmission rate testing also shows it has very low moisture permeability. However, tensile strength testing reveals LDPE has moderate strength for a plastic, so it may not be suitable for packaging that undergoes aggressive handling. It is chemically inert, odorless, and FDA approved for food contact.

In summary, there are several key properties of food packaging materials including barrier properties, chemical inertness, strength, odorlessness, and food safety. Various tests can be used to systematically investigate these properties and determine if a material is suitable for its intended use in food packaging. By testing different materials, the best option can be selected to maximize food freshness and shelf life. Overall, understanding the functions, properties, and testing of food packaging materials is critical to developing effective packaging solutions for the food industry.
