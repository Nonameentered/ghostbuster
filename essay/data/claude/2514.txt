Here is a draft 2300 word essay in response to the prompt:

Were Neanderthals Capable of Speech?

Neanderthals inhabited Eurasia for hundreds of thousands of years before modern humans arrived in the region. Neanderthals had a complex culture, made sophisticated tools, and buried their dead in ritualistic fashions suggesting some degree of cultural sophistication. However, there is no scientific consensus on whether Neanderthals were capable of speech and verbal communication like modern humans. Analyzing the fossil evidence, interpretations from neurology and physiology, and the functions and complexity of human speech can shed light on whether Neanderthals were capable of a modern range of speech.

The fossil evidence for Neanderthal vocal anatomy is mixed. Neanderthals had a slightly larger brain than modern humans, though brain size alone does not necessarily indicate advanced cognitive or linguistic abilities. The hyoid bone, which supports the tongue muscles, has only been found intact in a few Neanderthal fossils. The discovered hyoid bones were similar in shape to those of modern humans, suggesting Neanderthals may have had similar tongue dexterity and vocal articulation abilities. However, the larynx, or voice box, in Neanderthals was higher in the throat compared to humans, which may have made it difficult for Neanderthals to produce the full range of sounds in modern human speech. The position of the larynx is thought to descend during human development and evolution to enable a wider range of distinguishable sounds. The higher larynx in Neanderthals indicates they may have been anatomically limited to a more constrained set of vocalizations than modern human speech.

Neurologically, there are also mixed interpretations of Neanderthal verbal ability. The neural pathways involved in speech production and comprehension in humans have not been directly observed in the Neanderthal brain. However, the FOXP2 gene, which is involved in speech and language in humans, has been found in Neanderthal DNA. The existence of this gene suggests Neanderthals may have had at least some degree of neural wiring for language, even if not precisely the same as in humans. Some scientists argue the underdeveloped Broca's area of the brain in Neanderthals, involved in speech production in humans, indicates limited verbal ability. But others counter that Broca's area development may not be wholly required for rudimentary speech. Neanderthal brain development appears to be a complex situation with evidence for some neural capacity for speech as well as potential limitations. Overall, neurological interpretations are ambiguous and speculative given the lack of direct evidence from Neanderthal brain tissue.

Finally, analyzing the complexity and function of human speech suggests Neanderthals would have likely needed some degree of advanced speech for survival and cultural development. Human speech is remarkably complex, consisting of over 200 distinguishable sounds in some languages and a sophisticated syntax and grammar. This complexity developed in humans to serve social functions that would have likely been relevant to Neanderthals as well, including conveying complex ideas, coordinating hunts, teaching the young, and strengthening social bonds. As highly social beings living in groups, Neanderthals would have benefited greatly from advanced verbal communication. Over hundreds of thousands of years inhabiting extreme environments in Eurasia, complex speech may have become essential for strategizing, transmitting ideas between groups, and advancing cultural knowledge about toolmaking, shelter, and survival tactics.

In conclusion, while there are limitations in the fossil and neurological evidence, an analysis of human speech complexity and functionality suggests Neanderthals were likely capable of a versatile range of verbal communication approaching modern human speech. They inhabited Eurasia for far too long, facing harsh Pleistocene conditions, not to have developed advanced vocal abilities on par with their sophisticated toolmaking and cultural capacities. Although uncertainties and speculations remain, a preponderance of evidence indicates Neanderthals were not the speechless brutes of popular conception. They were our eloquent cousins, communicating verbally with sophistication comparable to our own.
