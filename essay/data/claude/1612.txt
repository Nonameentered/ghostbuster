Traditionally, publishers have served dual roles as both gatekeepers of culture and conservators of literature. They have determined which works are suitable for publication and distribution to the public, and in doing so have shaped cultural tastes and standards. They have also preserved and perpetuated works of literature by making them available to readers, often for generations. However, Post-Structuralist theory challenges these traditional roles of publishers.

Post-Structuralism questions the idea that any text has a single, fixed meaning. Instead, meaning is constructed by readers and can differ based on a reader's subjective interpretation and experience. From a Post-Structuralist view, publishers do not simply transmit or preserve the inherent or "true" meaning of texts. Rather, they participate in constructing meaning by choosing which texts to publish and distribute, framing how readers approach those texts, and determining what supplementary material accompanies texts. The meaning and significance of any work is not stable but depends on the context provided by publishers and the interpretations of readers. 

Post-Structuralism also challenges the idea of fixed categories of knowledge and fixed standards of taste that publishers have traditionally relied upon in their role as cultural gatekeepers. Post-Structuralism sees knowledge and culture as fragmented, complex, and locally situated. There are no universal standards of value or categories that apply across contexts. Publishers thus do not simply identify and promote works that meet objective standards of quality or conform to established genres. Rather, they actively construct cultural categories and standards through the works they choose to legitimize by publishing them. The role of publishers is one of constructing culture, not simply gatekeeping based on pre-existing standards.

At the same time, Post-Structuralism does not necessarily invalidate the work of publishers or make their traditional roles untenable. While meaning and cultural standards are constructed, not absolute, publishers can recognize their own role in this construction and make thoughtful choices that contribute to cultural conversations. Publishers also provide an important service by facilitating distribution of works that can then be interpreted in diverse ways by readers. They help connect texts and readers, even if they do not simply preserve fixed meanings. 

Reconciling the role of publishers to Post-Structuralism, then, means acknowledging their participatory role in constructing meaning, culture, and literary standardsâ€”not seeing them as simply gatekeepers who identify and transmit something that already exists in a final, objective form. However, this does not mean that publishers' choices do not matter or that all choices would be equally valid. Publishers still must thoughtfully consider the meanings and effects that may result from their choices and promote works that contribute value to readers and culture. But value comes through the diversity of interpretations and uses enabled by those choices, not through correspondence with some pre-existing, fixed standards. 

In conclusion, while Post-Structuralism challenges the traditional view of publishers as guardians of fixed meanings and standards, it does not obsolete the publishing industry or make its work irrelevant. But it means recognizing that publishers construct meaning and culture through the choices they make, instead of simply transmitting something already fully formed. A Post-Structuralist approach calls for thoughtful, conscientious participation in this process of construction. The publishing industry and its products can be reconciled with Post-Structuralism by exercising their roles not as gatekeepers of static things but as enablers of conversations that can steer culture and suggest meaning, even as those conversations and meanings remain open-ended. Overall, Post-Structuralism may demand more responsibility of publishers, but it also gives them more credit as creative participants rather than just preservers of something wholly external to them.
