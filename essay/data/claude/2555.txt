Discuss the portrayal of democracy in Euripides' 'Suppliants' as exemplified by the character of Theseus. How does Theseus defend the Athenian system of government and what are some of its perceived flaws? Does the play accurately reflect the reality of Athenian democracy at the time it was written?

In Euripides’ play ‘Suppliants’, the character of Theseus is used to portray the ideals of Athenian democracy. Through Theseus, Euripides presents the democratic system as a noble government based on principles of freedom, equality under the law, and collective decision making. However, Euripides also acknowledges the flaws of radical democracy through the play – these include demagoguery, conflict with traditional values, and short-sighted decision making. Overall, the play provides an accurate reflection of the reality of Athenian democracy in the 5th century BCE through its balanced exploration of both the merits and downfalls of radically democratic rule.

Theseus defends democracy by arguing that it provides freedom and equality for all citizens. He says "a single man may get it wrong, and turn monarchic rule into tyranny", but "the people, when it makes the laws,...fashions them to fair equality, leaning to nobler trusts". Collective decision making by citizens helps ensure that power is not abused. Democratic freedom also means that Theseus cannot force the citizens to war against their will - he depends on them voting to approve military action. However, Theseus acknowledges that demagogues can manipulate citizens for their own gain, undermining the ideals of equality and freedom. 

In addition, Theseus values the democratic principle of equal treatment under the law. He says "The meanest citizen is equally regarded by our laws". However, this radical equality is shown to conflict with traditional class and gender hierarchies, demonstrated by the Herald's discomfort with appealing to the Assembly, comprised of common people. The Herald believes some citizens are not "fit...to debate and resolve great issues". Similarly, the Egyptian Herald initially dismisses the Assembly as they were "but common men", preferring to appeal to Theseus' authority as a king.  

Finally, the play reflects the reality that citizens did not always make well-informed or prudent decisions. The Assembly votes to defend the suppliants against Creon's army before considering whether they have the military strength to do so. Theseus rebukes them for this rash choice, saying "when hot haste leads states to war,...not always doth the event match the beginnings". This reflects Plato's contemporary criticisms of radical democracy as leading to poorly reasoned choices appealing to the people's desires rather than logic or expertise.

In conclusion, 'Suppliants' presents Athenian democracy as embodying noble principles of freedom, equality and justice. However, Euripides also acknowledges the threats posed by radical democracy, including demagoguery, conflict with tradition, and short-sighted policy choices. By exploring both the ideals and realities of democracy in 5th century Athens, the play offers a balanced reflection of the Athenian political system under which Euripides lived. Overall, 'Suppliants' stands as a critique that fundamentally supports democracy, but calls for vigilance against its excesses and flaws.
