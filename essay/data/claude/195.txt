Infective endocarditis (IE) can be challenging to diagnose due to its vague and non-specific symptoms. Patients often present with fever, chills, fatigue, and unintentional weight loss, symptoms that could indicate many different infections or illnesses. The definitive diagnosis of IE requires direct visualization of valvular lesions or vegetations, typically via echocardiography. However, transthoracic echocardiography alone is often inadequate due to its limited sensitivity for detecting small vegetations. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) is superior in this regard but is a semi-invasive procedure. 

The Duke criteria were developed to help establish a diagnosis of IE in ambiguous cases based on clinical, echocardiographic and microbiological findings. They consist of major and minor criteria, with a high probability of IE requiring at least two major, one major and three minor, or five minor criteria. The major criteria include positive blood cultures, evidence of endocardial involvement on echocardiography, and new valvular regurgitation. The minor criteria include predisposing factors such as injecting drug use, fever, vascular phenomena such as Osler's nodes, and immunological phenomena such as elevated rheumatoid factor or cryoglobulinemia.

Echocardiography is crucial for confirming a diagnosis of IE as it allows direct visualization of vegetations, abscesses, valve regurgitation or perforation. Transoesophageal echocardiography is superior to transthoracic echocardiography for detecting small vegetations and other lesions, with a sensitivity of over 90% compared to around 50-70% for transthoracic echocardiography. Echocardiography should be repeated during treatment to monitor disease progression or resolution. 

Once diagnosed, patients require prompt antibiotic treatment for a prolonged course of 4 to 6 weeks. Complications arise in up to 50% of cases and include heart failure, abscess formation, septic embolization, and valvular surgery. Surgery may be urgently needed for uncontrolled infection, heart failure, or prevention of embolic events. A case study of a 31-year-old male injecting drug user presenting with fever, chills and fatigue demonstrates these management principles. Clinical suspicion was high but blood cultures were negative and transthoracic echo was non-diagnostic. TOE revealed tricuspid valve vegetations, leading to a diagnosis of tricuspid valve IE. The patient received antibiotic treatment but suffered septic pulmonary emboli, requiring emergency tricuspid valve replacement. He recovered well with ongoing antibiotics post-surgery.

In summary, IE remains challenging to diagnose due to its vague presentations and often negative initial investigations. The Duke criteria and echocardiography, particularly TOE, are essential for confirming the diagnosis. Early diagnosis and treatment with prolonged antibiotics are required to minimize the risk of severe complications, which are common and may necessitate urgent surgery. Careful monitoring is needed throughout the disease course and recovery.
