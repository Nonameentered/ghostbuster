Lowland heath habitat in England has a long historical presence but has declined severely in the last century due to development, agriculture, and lack of management. Lowland heath is an open landscape dominated by heathers and acidic grasslands in the lowlands of southern England. It has been present in the English landscape for at least 5,000 years since the clearance of woodland by prehistoric farmers. Lowland heath reached its maximum extent in the 19th century but has declined by over 80% since then due to enclosure for agriculture, afforestation, and development. What remains is highly fragmented.

Lowland heath is an internationally important habitat and provides a home for rare plants, birds, reptiles, and invertebrates. Species depending on lowland heath include nightjars, Dartford warblers, sand lizards, and silver-studded blue butterflies. However, the biodiversity of lowland heath depends on active management to maintain an open structure and encourage new growth. Historically, this management was achieved through grazing. After the 19th century, grazing declined leading to scrub encroachment and loss of biodiversity. Today, conservation grazing using sheep, cattle, and sometimes ponies is an effective way to restore biodiversity to lowland heath. Grazing helps to control scrub, creates patches of bare ground for seed germination, and promotes new growth of heather and other lowland heath plants.

The major threats to lowland heath today are a lack of management leading to scrub encroachment, nitrogen deposition which gives a competitive advantage to grasses over heathers, fragmented land ownership making coordinated management difficult, and development pressure. Scrub encroachment in the absence of grazing has reduced biodiversity over large areas of remaining lowland heath. Nitrogen deposition exceeds critical loads across most heathlands, favoring dense grass growth. Lowland heath habitats are often in isolated, fragmented parcels with multiple private landowners, creating challenges for effective management at a landscape scale. And continuing development consumes remaining areas of heathland due to demand for new housing and transport links.

To ensure the long term survival of lowland heath and its biodiversity, more active management using grazing and cutting is needed across large, connected areas of habitat. Conservation organizations are working to coordinate management across landowners, increase the use of grazing for scrub control, and reduce nitrogen inputs. strictly controlling new development and transportation projects can help limit further losses of lowland heath habitat. Expanding existing protected areas and establishing ecological corridors between them also supports more resilient heathland habitats and wildlife populations. With concerted action, it is possible to restore more robust and interconnected tracts of lowland heath, conserving an iconic English landscape and the rare biodiversity it contains for future generations.
