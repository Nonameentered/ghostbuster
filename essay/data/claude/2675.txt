Seed priming is a pre-sowing treatment used to help synchronize germination in non-dormant seeds. It involves exposing seeds to low levels of moisture that initiates the pre-germination physiological processes required for germination but prevents radical emergence. This primes the seeds to germinate more quickly, uniformly, and at a higher percentage once sown in optimal conditions. 

To explore the impact of different priming treatments on seed germination, an experiment was conducted on onion seeds. Onion seeds were chosen as they are non-dormant, easy to germinate, and germinate uniformly under normal conditions. Seeds were subjected to four priming treatments: hydropriming (soaking in water), osmopriming (soaking in a polyethylene glycol solution), halopriming (soaking in salt solutions), and unprimed controls. After priming for 24 hours, the seeds were rinsed, dried back to their original moisture content and weight, and then sown.

Germination was measured in terms of viability (the total percentage of seeds that germinated), rate (the speed at which seeds germinated measured by timing to 50% germination), and uniformity (the variation in timing of germination measured by the standard deviation from the mean germination time). In all three measures, primed seeds showed significant improvements over unprimed seeds. Hydroprimed and osmoprimed seeds showed the greatest increases in viability, achieving 90-95% germination compared to 70-75% in unprimed seeds. These two treatments also had the fastest rates of germination at 2-3 days compared to 5-6 days in unprimed seeds. Halopriming was not as effective, showing only minor improvements in viability and germination rate.

All priming treatments showed improved uniformity in germination timing over unprimed seeds as evidenced by lower standard deviations. The most uniform germination was achieved by hydropriming with nearly all seeds germinating within a 12 hour period compared to 48 hours for unprimed seeds. Overall, the results show that priming onion seeds prior to sowing significantly improved seed germination and vigor.

The implications of these findings are that seed priming shows promise for improving germination performance, especially viability and uniformity, on a large scale. Seed priming is a simple, low-cost treatment, though more research is needed to determine optimal priming conditions for different crops. By optimizing uniformity, priming could help reduce thinning costs in commercial crop production. The use of priming could also increase the window for optimal sowing conditions. With better germination and seedling establishment, priming may allow earlier sowing dates that take advantage of the entire growing season. However, some potential downsides like fungal growth and impacts on seed longevity need to be considered before large scale adoption.
