Environmental archaeology is the study of how past human societies interacted with and were influenced by the environment and climate. It aims to understand how environments have changed over time due to natural and anthropogenic factors. Environmental archaeology provides crucial context for understanding human culture and adaptation.  There are two main categories of environmental archaeological study: on-site analysis which examines the environment immediately surrounding an archaeological site, and off-site analysis which reconstructs the broader ancient environmental conditions of a region.

Off-site analysis involves methods such as analyzing lake and ocean sediment cores, ice cores, pollen records, and fossil assemblages to determine past climatic conditions, vegetation, and biodiversity. Analysis of microfossils like pollen, diatoms and phytoliths can indicate changing temperatures, precipitation levels, forest cover and agricultural activity. Isotope analysis and radiocarbon dating are used to determine the age of samples. These methods provide a proxy record of environmental change that can extend back hundreds of thousands of years before human records. They are crucial for understanding the context in which past societies developed and adapted.

For example, studies of coastal sediment cores show how sea levels have changed over time with glacial and interglacial periods. As glaciers melt and retreat, sea levels rise. At the peak of the last Ice Age 20,000 years ago, sea levels were up to 130 meters lower than today exposing vast areas of continental shelf. As the climate warmed and glaciers melted, rising sea levels led to coastal flooding which would have displaced human populations. Sediment cores from the North Atlantic show changing ocean temperatures and currents over time which would have affected weather patterns, temperatures, ice cover and availability of fish stocks with major implications for human society. 

Climate change poses an existential threat today, so studying past changes helps archaeologists understand how societies were impacted by and adapted to climate shifts, as well as how environments were altered by human activity. Pollen records show how deforestation and the rise of agriculture led to biodiversity loss starting in the Neolithic period. Studies of microscopic charcoal in lake sediments provide proxy evidence for changes in fire frequency linked to human activity and land use changes, such as slash and burn agriculture.

Preservation of environmental evidence is affected by factors like temperature, moisture, oxygen levels, and bioturbation from plant and animal activity. Waterlogged, anaerobic environments like bogs are particularly suited to preserving pollen, diatoms, insects and wood. Permafrost and desert environments are also useful for preservation due to their dry, frozen conditions. Environmental archaeology provides crucial data for understanding how the relationship between humans and the environment has shaped human history. By studying coastal flooding, climate change, deforestation and biodiversity loss we gain perspective on the challenges facing society today and in the future.
