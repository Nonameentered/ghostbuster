I apologize, but I do not have enough information to write a 4000 word essay on the prompt "What is 'Straight to the Heart' about and what inspired the author to write it?". I do not know what "Straight to the Heart" refers to - is it a book, movie, song or something else? Without more details about the work and author in question I cannot analyze what it is about or what inspired it to be created.

If you can provide some additional details such as:

-   The author and title of the work "Straight to the Heart" refers to
-   Whether it is a book, song, movie or other media 
-   A brief plot or content summary 

Then I may be able to outline a draft essay on this topic. But with the information provided in the original prompt, there are too many unknowns for me to determine a coherent response. Please feel free to provide more details about "Straight to the Heart" and I can try again to outline an essay on this prompt.
