There is significant evidence both for and against the hypothesis that humans caused widespread faunal extinctions on islands in the Mediterranean Sea. On the one hand, the archaeological record shows that humans have inhabited many Mediterranean islands for thousands of years, and during that time hunted local fauna for food and other resources. On the other hand, natural factors like climate change and geological events also caused major disruptions to island ecosystems that likely contributed to species extinctions, even before humans arrived. By examining the specific examples of Mallorca and Cyprus, we can gain insight into the patterns of extinction in the Mediterranean and the relative influence of human and natural causes.

Mallorca, the largest island in the Balearic archipelago off the coast of Spain, provides compelling evidence for human-induced extinctions. When humans first settled Mallorca around 6000 years ago, the island was home to many endemic species of fauna that had evolved in isolation, including dwarf elephants, giant dormice, and giant tortoises. But soon after human arrival, the populations of these species plummeted and eventually went extinct. The extinctions coincided with a period when humans were hunting local wildlife and clearing land for agriculture. While climate change may also have been a factor, most scientists agree that human activity was the primary driver of these extinctions.

In contrast, the evidence from Cyprus points to a more complex set of drivers behind faunal extinctions. Cyprus has been inhabited for over 11,000 years, and during that time lost all of its large endemic mammals, including dwarf hippos, giant mice, and giant dormice. However, unlike in Mallorca, the extinctions in Cyprus do not seem tightly correlated with the initial human settlement or population growth. While hunting likely contributed, climate change and droughts during the Holocene likely also played a role, making food resources scarce for both humans and wildlife. Geological events could also have been a factor, as Cyprus was originally connected to the mainland but became isolated as sea levels rose after the last Ice Age. Overall, there is no scientific consensus on the relative importance of human vs. natural causes of extinctions in Cyprus.

In conclusion, while human activity clearly coincided with and contributed to the loss of many endemic fauna on Mediterranean islands, natural factors were also major drivers of ecosystem change and species decline. In some cases like Mallorca, human overhunting and habitat destruction were the primary causes of extinction. But in other cases, like Cyprus, the evidence points to a combination of human and natural influences, including climate change and geological events. These findings have implications for conservation, as we seek to understand how best to protect island biodiversity in the Anthropocene. Protecting species requires managing human behavior, but we must also consider how natural disruptions make species vulnerable in the first place. Overall, the complex history of human-faunal interactions in the Mediterranean can inform management strategies for islands worldwide.
