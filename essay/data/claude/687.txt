Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis, affecting more than 32 million Americans. OA occurs when the cartilage that cushions the joints breaks down over time, resulting in the bones rubbing together and causing pain, stiffness, and mobility issues. The most common joints affected by OA include the knees, hips, hands, and spine. 

The key physical signs that support a diagnosis of osteoarthritis include joint pain, joint swelling, decreased range of motion, stiffness, bone spurs, and joint crepitus (a crackling sound when the joint is moved). The pain is usually described as an dull ache that worsens with movement and activity. The joints may be swollen, warm, and tender to touch. The range of motion of the affected joint decreases over time due to pain and the formation of bone spurs. Morning stiffness is common and can last 30 minutes or more. Bone spurs can often be felt around the joint. Joint crepitus, a grating sensation, can be felt or heard when the joint is moved.

The main differential diagnoses to consider include rheumatoid arthritis, gout, muscle sprain, and stress fractures. Rheumatoid arthritis often affects the smaller joints in the hands and feet, causes substantial joint swelling and pain, and leads to joint deformity. Gout can cause sudden onset of excruciating pain, redness, swelling, and tenderness in joints. Muscle sprains and stress fractures can cause localized pain, swelling, and mobility issues but usually get better with rest. Diagnostic tests like joint X-rays, blood tests, and joint fluid analysis can help determine the correct diagnosis.

Treatment for osteoarthritis focuses on managing pain and improving joint mobility and function. Common options include physical therapy, exercise, weight loss, medication, steroid injections, lifestyle changes, bracing, and in severe cases, joint replacement surgery. Physical therapy and exercise can strengthen the muscles around the joint and improve flexibility and range of motion. Losing excess weight reduces stress on the joints. Medications such as acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids can help reduce pain and inflammation. Lifestyle changes such as heat/ice, splinting, and relaxation techniques may provide some relief. For advanced OA, joint replacement surgery may be recommended to relieve pain and restore joint mobility.

The most common surgeries for osteoarthritis include knee replacement, hip replacement, shoulder replacement, and interphalangeal joint arthroplasty. In knee replacement surgery, the damaged knee joint surfaces are replaced with artificial components. Hip replacement surgery replaces the hip joint socket and thigh bone with prosthetic implants. Shoulder replacement replaces damaged parts of the shoulder joint. Interphalangeal joint arthroplasty fuses or replaces finger joints. These joint replacement surgeries are very effective at relieving pain, improving joint function, and enhancing quality of life for those with end-stage osteoarthritis.

In summary, osteoarthritis causes significant pain, mobility issues, and reduced quality of life for millions of people worldwide. Diagnosis is based on symptoms such as joint pain, stiffness, swelling, decreased range of motion, and joint crepitus as well as imaging tests. Treatment options range from conservative to surgical interventions based on the severity of symptoms and level of disability. Joint replacement can be highly effective at relieving pain and restoring joint function for those with severe osteoarthritis.
