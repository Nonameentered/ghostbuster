There are several parameters used to analyze a first order plus deadtime (FOPDT) system in a report including the gain (K), time constant (τ), and deadtime (θ). The gain represents the steady state change in the output for a change in the input. The time constant represents how quickly the system responds to changes. The deadtime is the delay between the input changing and the output beginning to respond. 

Analog control uses continuous signals while discrete control uses sampled signals. Discrete control can lead to instability if the sampling rate is too low. The Ziegler-Nichols tuning method determines values for the proportional gain (Kp), integral time (Ti), and derivative time (Td) to optimize the closed loop response. For a FOPDT system, the critical proportional gain (Ku) and ultimate period (Pu) are determined from a process reaction curve.

A proportional only controller (P-only) provides a control output proportional to the error. It reduces the steady state error but leads to a non-zero error and can cause oscillation. A Dahlin controller uses a modified Ziegler-Nichols method to determine design values that improve stability and reduce overshoot compared to P-only control.

The transfer function of a discrete PID controller using the Dahlin method for a FOPDT system is:

C(z) = Kp + Ki/(1-z^-1) + Kd(1-z^-1)/T  

Where Kp is the proportional gain, Ki is the integral gain, Kd is the derivative gain, and T is the sample time. This transfer function represents how the controller affects the system based on its parameters.

In summary, the parameters used to analyze a FOPDT system are K, τ, and θ. Analog and discrete control differ in how they sample input and can impact stability. The Ziegler-Nichols method determines design values for PID control. A Dahlin controller improves on P-only control for FOPDT systems. And the transfer function of a Dahlin discrete PID controller represents how it impacts the system.
