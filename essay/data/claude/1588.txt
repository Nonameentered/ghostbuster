The City of Buenos Aires experienced major challenges in its destinations and tourism sector between December 2001 and February 2003. The deep economic recession and political turmoil in Argentina during this period led to a crisis that significantly impacted tourism in Buenos Aires. There were several negative trends observed in the destinations sector and city tourism during this time.

First, there was a steep decline in international tourist arrivals to Buenos Aires and Argentina overall. According to government statistics, the number of international visitors fell by over 25% between 2001 and 2002 due to the economic crisis and devaluation of the peso. Fewer tourists led to lower revenue and demand for tourism services. The restrictions on accessing cash and limits on foreign currency exchange also made Argentina a less attractive destination. 

Second, many hotels and tourism businesses closed down or cut staff. The occupancy rates at major hotels in Buenos Aires dropped below 30% at the worst point of the crisis.  Many hotels could not generate enough revenue to remain open. It is estimated that a third of travel agencies and tour operators in Buenos Aires also closed due to lack of business. This led to job losses in the tourism sector and reduced access to services for visitors.

Third, investment in the tourism sector and infrastructure stalled due to the crisis. Many tourism development projects were put on hold or cancelled due to lack of public and private funds. Limited investment meant destinations and attractions were not improved or expanded to keep up with the demands of tourists. Safety and security issues also arose from lack of funding for essential services.

However, since 2003, the tourism sector in Buenos Aires has gradually recovered along with the broader economy. The peso stabilized, restrictions on accessing money eased, and international tourism promotion resumed. Hotel occupancy and tourism business revenue have rebounded, and new investments in tourism assets have been made. The number of international visitors is again on the rise.  

Looking ahead, if Argentina's economy continues to recover and grow over the next few years, tourism in Buenos Aires is poised to expand strongly. Pent-up demand for travel, increasing middle class in neighboring countries, and competitive prices will attract more visitors. Tourism will benefit from renewed investment in infrastructure, destination development, and advertising. However, economic and political uncertainty still pose risks to the tourism sector. Another crisis of confidence could again significantly impact the city's tourism industry.    

In summary, between 2001 and 2003, Buenos Aires' tourism sector experienced substantial declines in business and international arrivals, job losses, and stalled investment due to the major economic crisis and recession in Argentina. However, since 2003, tourism has rebounded in line with the economy. Continued economic recovery and growth should drive a new period of expanding tourism demand and investment in Buenos Aires if stability can be maintained. Overall, the city's destinations and tourism sector directly mirror the highs and lows in the broader economy.
