Various methods were employed to determine the true current flowing in the circuit shown in Figure 1. The first method used was to connect an ammeter in series at points A and D to directly measure the current. The ammeter reading showed a current of 3.2 amperes. However, upon further analysis, this value appeared to be incorrect.  

A second approach was to use Ohm's law to calculate the theoretical current. The voltage source in the circuit is 120V. The total resistance in the circuit can be calculated by adding the resistor values: 10Ω + 15Ω + 20Ω = 45Ω. Using Ohm's law, Current = Voltage / Resistance, the calculated current is 120V / 45Ω = 2.67A. This calculated value does not match the ammeter measurement, indicating there may be an issue with the circuit.

To troubleshoot the circuit, each component was tested individually. The voltage source was tested and outputting 120V as expected. Each resistor was tested and found to have the proper resistance values. However, when the ammeter was tested alone, it was found to give an erroneous reading of 1.2A when no current was flowing. This faulty ammeter was replaced, and the measurement was repeated.

With the new ammeter in place, a current measurement of 2.7A was obtained, which matches the calculated theoretical value. This confirms that the original ammeter was defective, giving an incorrect reading. The theoretical analysis and troubleshooting process were necessary to determine the true current in the circuit.

Several issues were identified with the initial circuit design. The first was the use of a faulty ammeter that provided an incorrect measurement. Relying on a single method of measurement and not verifying the results is problematic. For accurate measurements, it is good practice to double check values using multiple methods or instruments.  

The second issue was the lack of troubleshooting foresight. The circuit was assumed to be correct without confirming that each individual component was working properly. When anomalies arise, it is important to methodically test each part of the circuit to find the fault. Troubleshooting the issue in a systematic way, rather than making assumptions, is critical for effective circuit design.

In summary, a multi-step process involving measurement, calculation, re-measurement, and troubleshooting was necessary to determine the true current in the circuit. The issues with the initial design were incorrect readings from a faulty instrument and lack of thorough troubleshooting methodology. Addressing these issues with redundant measurement techniques and systematic troubleshooting led to determining the accurate current value for the circuit.
