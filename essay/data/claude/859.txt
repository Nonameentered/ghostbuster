The Inca civilization in South America lasted from 1300 to 1532 AD and covered a large area encompassing much of modern-day Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile and portions of Argentina and Colombia. The Inca state was highly organized and centrally controlled, with aspects of communal land ownership, cooperation and redistribution that are characteristic of socialist societies. However, the Inca state also featured a strict hierarchy, massive wealth inequality, and obligatory labor demands akin to slavery that contradict socialist ideals. Overall, while the Inca civilization exhibited some attributes of socialism, particularly in its economics, it cannot be classified as a purely socialist state. 

Socialism is characterized by collective or cooperative ownership of land and the means of production, economic equality, and redistribution of wealth to benefit the whole of society. Under a socialist system, private property and profit accumulation by individuals are limited or eliminated. In the Inca empire, agricultural land was collectively owned by the ayllu, a kinship group, and farmed cooperatively. The harvests were redistributed to ensure even those unable to work, like the old or infirm, were provided for. 

However, the Inca emperor, Sapa Inca, and nobility controlled massive amounts of wealth, land, and resources. The lower classes had limited upward mobility and were obligated to pay heavy taxes in the form of labor and goods to the state. While resources were redistributed down to the provincial and village levels to meet the basic needs of the population, huge inequalities remained in place between the haves and the have-nots that violate the socialist principle of equality.

Economically, the Inca civilization did revolve around cooperation and the sharing of resources to benefit the community as a whole above the individual. Surplus supplies, whether from agriculture, textile production or mining, flowed into the state institutions and were reallocated to areas of need through a complex system of supply trains and warehouses. However, participation in the economy was not voluntary but instead compulsory through the mit'a system of obligatory labor required from villages and in the form of taxes. The Inca state forced conquered peoples into the Inca economy and labor system, demanding goods, resources and building labor as a form of tribute. This undermines the socialist notion that production should be collectively organized for the benefit of all participants.

In conclusion, while the Inca empire exhibited a sense of mutual obligation to redistribute resources and provide for the basic welfare of communities, as well as cooperative land ownership and economic policies benefitting society as a whole over the individual, there were significant deviations from the socialist ideal. The massive inequality perpetuated by the rigid class system, the disproportionate accumulation of wealth and power in the hands of the Inca elite, and the obligatory nature of participation in the economy and labor system reflect a coercive state apparatus that does not qualify as purely socialist. The Inca civilization cannot be categorized as a socialist state, although it displayed some attributes of a socialist society. Overall it was a vastly complex system with both cooperative and despotic features.
