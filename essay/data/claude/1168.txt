The Great Depression of the 1930s was a period of widespread economic hardship for most Americans. However, some groups, including African Americans, farmers, and industrial workers, faced uniquely devastating challenges during this time. The struggles these groups experienced helped catalyze profound cultural shifts that shaped American society for decades. At the same time, New Deal programs provided relief for many Americans, though the benefits were not distributed evenly across social groups. 

African Americans endured systematic discrimination and economic deprivation during the Depression that reinforced their marginalized position in American society. Jim Crow laws and discriminatory practices made it difficult for African Americans to find jobs even before the stock market crash of 1929. As unemployment skyrocketed during the Depression, African Americans were often the first fired and the last rehired. Those able to find work faced lower pay and worse conditions than their white counterparts. The hardships of the Depression thus exacerbated the inequalities African Americans faced daily, cementing their status as second-class citizens.

However, the Depression also spurred the growth of African American cultural institutions and art forms, like the Harlem Renaissance, that celebrated black identity and community. Iconic artists like Langston Hughes and Billie Holiday rose to prominence during this era. The suffering and resilience of African Americans also galvanized broader calls for equality and justice, setting the stage for later civil rights movements. In these ways, the difficulties African Americans endured during the Depression ironically fueled cultural and social changes that would eventually challenge the systemic racism they faced.  

Farmers likewise faced immense hardships during the Depression that contributed to the transformation of rural America. Falling crop prices and droughts led to foreclosures and poverty for millions of farmers. Hundreds of thousands of farmers migrated to cities, creating long-lasting changes in America's settlement patterns. However, New Deal programs provided relief to some farmers in the form of subsidies, credits, and debt relief. The Agricultural Adjustment Act, for example, paid farmers subsidies to take land out of production to raise crop prices. The Rural Electrification Administration provided loans to electrify isolated farms.

These programs helped many farmers retain their livelihoods, though benefits were distributed unevenly across regions and crops. Farmers in some areas, especially black farmers and sharecroppers in the South, continued to struggle with poverty due to discrimination in program administration. However, New Deal farm programs did help stem foreclosures, raise crop prices, and modernize infrastructure in rural America, cushioning the blow of the Depression for some.   

In contrast, wealthy Americans were largely spared from the hardships that shaped the experiences of African Americans, farmers, and other groups. The wealthy could rely on their existing assets and connections to maintain their social position. While some lost portions of their fortunes in the stock market crash, the wealthy did not face the threats of homelessness, hunger, or joblessness that plagued much of the population. They were often critical of New Deal programs that provided relief to other Americans at government expense. 

In conclusion, African Americans, farmers, and other groups faced unparalleled hardships during the Great Depression that fueled cultural and social changes remaking America. New Deal programs provided relief to some members of these groups but failed to remedy the systemic inequalities and discrimination at the root of their suffering. Meanwhile, the wealthy were largely insulated from the hardships that shaped Depression-era America. The unequal effects of the Depression and government response demonstrate the deep social cleavages and injustices that remained despite progress in some areas of American life. Overall, the 1930s marked a transformative era in which the struggles of marginalized groups spurred action that would eventually move America closer to ideals of equality and justice for all.
