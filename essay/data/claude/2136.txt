How did Augustus use propaganda to subtly suggest his divinity and link to the gods, and how did myths about his lineage and the founding of Rome support his claims to divinity? 

Augustus, the first Roman emperor, was a master of propaganda and subtle political messaging. He did not openly declare himself divine but instead allowed implications and symbols to speak for themselves, pointing to his connection with the gods and his role as a savior of Rome. Two key ways Augustus linked himself to the divine were through art and architecture that associated him with heroic figures of Roman myth, and through claims of direct descent from the goddess Venus.

In art and public works, Augustus associated himself with figures from Roman myth and legend like Aeneas, Romulus, and Mars to suggest his own heroic and semi-divine status. For instance, Augustus adopted Aeneas, the mythical Trojan founder of Rome, as a personal symbol. The Aeneid, Virgil's epic poem commissioned by Augustus, traces Aeneas's journey to Italy where he founded Rome. By association with this story, Augustus implied a connection between his own rule and the very foundation of Rome. Statues and images also frequently paired or aligned Augustus with Romulus, one of the founders of Rome, and with Mars, the god of war and legendary father of Romulus. Aligning himself with such heroic and divine figures allowed Augustus to bask in their reflected glory.

Augustus also claimed direct descent from the goddess Venus through her son Aeneas, according to Roman mythology. In 36 BCE, the Roman Senate dedicated a temple to Mars Ultor ("Mars the Avenger") to honor Augustus's victory at the Battle of Philippi. The temple depicted statues of both Mars and Venus, implying they were the divine parents of Augustus. Poets like Horace and Virgil further celebrated Augustus's supposed lineage from Venus. Although implausible, this divine association and lineage helped cement Augustus's status as more than a mere mortal.  

Through art, architecture, and myth, Augustus forged subtle connections between himself and the gods that allowed educated Romans to perceive his divinity and unique status, even while he avoided openly declaring it. Masterful propaganda and promotion of myths about his own lineage and links to Rome's legendary founders and protectors helped secure Augustus's position as a savior and semi-divine ruler of Rome. Overall, Augustus's careful cultivation of his public image and association with mythic heroes and deities was a crucial pillar of support for his long and remarkable reign as Rome's first emperor.
