Here is a 500 word essay in response to the prompt:

The key steps involved in creating an order placement program are:

1. Gathering order information from the user. This includes prompting the user to enter details like their name, address, payment information, and the products/services they want to order. The prompts should be clear and easy to understand to avoid confusion. It may be helpful to provide examples of the requested information.  

2. Validate the order information. Ensure the name, address, and payment details are accurate and legitimate. Also confirm that the selected products/services are actually available to order. If there are any errors or issues, prompt the user to re-enter the necessary information.

3. Calculate order totals. Add up the prices of the individual products/services selected to determine subtotals for categories of items as well as a grand total for the entire order. Clearly display all calculated totals to the user for review and confirmation.

4. Have the user confirm the order. Prompt the user to review all entered information including the details of selected products/services and the calculated totals. Only proceed to the next step if the user confirms the order details are correct.  

5. Process the payment. Charge the user's selected payment method for the grand total amount of the order. Display a message to the user to notify them that payment has been processed successfully. 

6. Confirmation of order receipt. Provide the user with a confirmation or receipt number for their order along with a summary of all the pertinent details of their purchase including items ordered and amounts charged. Thank them for their business.

Some ways these steps could be improved and refined include: streamlining the user interfaces to minimize clicks and scrolling needed, building in additional validation checks on entered data to catch more errors upfront, displaying summary information on each step so the user can easily see what they've entered so far, and sending email receipts and order summaries in addition to on-screen confirmations. With refinements like these, an order placement system can be made very efficient, user-friendly, and secure.
