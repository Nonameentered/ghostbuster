To extract, purify, and characterize eugenol, several steps were undertaken. First, dry cloves were ground up to increase the surface area and facilitate extraction. The ground cloves were then extracted using solvents, specifically diethyl ether and methanol. The solvent extracts were then combined and the solvents removed using rotary evaporation to yield a crude eugenol extract. Column chromatography was then employed to purify the extract by separating out the eugenol from other compounds. Fractions were analyzed using thin-layer chromatography to identify those containing eugenol, which were then combined.

During the extraction and purification process, several errors were encountered that affected the results. For the extraction, not all of the eugenol may have been extracted from the ground cloves, resulting in a lower yield. Also, some eugenol likely degraded or oxidized during the evaporation process when the extract was exposed to heat and oxygen. In the column chromatography procedure, fractions may have been improperly collected or pooled, resulting in an impure eugenol sample. Better monitoring of the fractions during chromatographic separation could have prevented this. Overall, more controlled and optimized conditions during extraction and purification would likely improve the yield and purity of the eugenol sample.

To confirm the composition and identity of the purified sample, several characterization tests were performed. Infrared spectroscopy was used to determine the functional groups present, which matched the expected profile for eugenol. Gas chromatography was employed to determine the number of components in the sample, confirming it contained mainly a single compound.  Finally, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to identify the positions and number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule, which matched the structure of eugenol.

In summary, through a multi-step process, eugenol was extracted from ground cloves, purified using column chromatography, and characterized using several spectroscopic techniques. With improved optimization and control, a higher yield and purity of eugenol could likely have been achieved. The characterization tests were critical in confirming that the purified sample was eugenol, validating the overall experimental procedure.
