Coral reefs around the world are experiencing a significant increase in the occurrence of diseases over the past few decades. There are several causes contributing to the spread of diseases affecting coral reefs. Some of the major causes include pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi that infect coral tissues and the warm-water conditions that enable the growth and spread of these pathogens. Human activities such as pollution, sedimentation, tourism, and climate change also play a significant role in the increase of coral diseases. 

There are many types of coral diseases caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi. Black band disease is caused by cyanobacteria and affects many coral species. White band disease is caused by bacteria such as Vibrio and affects acroporid corals. Yellow blotch disease is caused by a fungus and affects golf ball corals. Skeletal eroding band disease is caused by protozoa called halofolliculina corallasia and affects brain corals and star corals. Aspergillosis is caused by fungi in the Aspergillus genus and causes lesions and tissue necrosis in sea fans. Each disease has specific pathogens associated with them that infect different coral species.

Several human activities are contributing to the spread of diseases in coral reefs around the world. Pollution from agricultural and industrial sources introduces excess nutrients, chemicals, and sediments that enable the growth of pathogens and impair the coral's immune system. Tourism activities like snorkeling and scuba diving also increase the risk of physical damage and transmission of diseases between coral colonies. Sedimentation from dredging and coastal development blocks sunlight and smothers corals, making them more susceptible to infections. Plastic pollution also provides vectors for pathogens to adhere to and spread between coral colonies.

Global climate change is projected to significantly worsen the impacts of diseases on coral reefs. As the climate continues to warm, ocean temperatures are rising which increases the growth and spread of infectious pathogens that cause diseases. Warming oceans also lead to coral bleaching which makes corals weaker and more prone to infections. Changes in rainfall patterns can also alter water salinity levels in coastal areas and exacerbate the spread of coral diseases. Sea level rise puts corals at greater risk of drowning and exposure to sediments and pollutants. The impacts of climate change thus threaten to accelerate the spread of diseases in coral reefs around the world.  

In conclusion, coral reef diseases are caused by various pathogens and exacerbated by human activities as well as climate change. By reducing pollution, limiting physical damage to reefs, and tackling climate change, we can curtail the spread of diseases that pose a severe threat to the world's corals and the marine biodiversity they support. Protecting coral reefs requires global and local solutions to manage human impacts on these critical yet fragile ecosystems.
