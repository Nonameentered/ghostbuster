Aortic valve incompetence, or aortic regurgitation, is a condition in which the aortic valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow backward from the aorta into the left ventricle. This is caused by damage or disease of the aortic valve, preventing the valve leaflets from closing tightly. The most common causes are congenital bicuspid aortic valve, endocarditis, aortic dissection, or rheumatic heart disease.

With aortic regurgitation, some of the blood that is ejected from the left ventricle flows back into it, causing an increase in the volume of blood in the left ventricle. This leads to enlargement and stretching of the left ventricle over time. The increased volume of blood causes a larger stroke volume, which initially compensates and allows the left ventricle to eject a normal fraction of its contents. However, with progressive worsening of the condition, the left ventricle cannot keep up, leading to congestive heart failure and decreased cardiac output. 

This results in symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and leg edema due to the backup of blood flow. The blood returning from the lungs and lower body has difficulty entering the left atrium and ventricle, leading to increased pressures that cause fluid buildup in the lungs and legs. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms, but the only definitive treatment for aortic regurgitation is surgical valve repair or replacement.

After aortic valve surgery, the left ventricle remodeling process begins to reverse. The left ventricle size and volume decrease, and parameters such as ejection fraction improve with time. Patients experience decreased shortness of breath, resolution of edema, and an improved exercise tolerance. Quality of life is significantly improved for most patients with relief of symptoms and avoidance of complications associated with severe aortic regurgitation. Patients can expect to live active and productive lives for many years following successful aortic valve surgery.

In summary, aortic valve incompetence causes volume overload of the left ventricle, leading to shortness of breath and leg edema. Surgery to repair or replace the aortic valve corrects the condition, decreases left ventricle size, reduces symptoms, and substantially improves quality of life and life expectancy.
