Snowflakes form through a process called crystallization, where water vapor in the atmosphere condenses into ice directly. Several factors contribute to the formation and unique structure of snowflakes. 

The first factor is the temperature at which the snowflake forms. Snowflakes form between 0°F and 32°F, and the ideal temperature is around 14.5°F. At this temperature, water molecules will condense into solid ice, but the molecules still have enough energy to arrange themselves into intricate lattices. Colder temperatures lead to simpler shapes as the water molecules are not moving fast enough to form complex structures. Warmer temperatures mean the water droplets do not fully solidify into ice crystals.

The second factor is humidity and the availability of water vapor. Snowflake formation requires moisture and condensation of water vapor onto a particle in the atmosphere. Optimal humidity levels are around 80% relative humidity or higher. At lower humidities, not enough water vapor is available to promote crystallization. At extremely high humidities, the abundance of water droplets prevents the orderly formation of lattice structures.

The third factor is the presence of atmospheric dust or other particulates. These tiny suspended particles in the atmosphere act as nuclei for the condensation of water vapor. The nature of the nucleus, like its size and surface properties, will influence the pattern of crystal growth. Different nuclei will lead to different snowflake shapes and structures.

Due to the sensitivity to these factors during formation, it is highly unlikely that any two snowflakes will become perfectly identical. The temperature, humidity, and nature of atmospheric particulates at any given location and time will be unique. Small fluctuations in these factors can lead to significant differences in the way water molecules attach and the shapes they form. The chances of exactly the same conditions and crystallization process occurring for two separate snowflakes are extraordinarily small. 

In conclusion, snowflakes owe their hexagonal symmetry and delicacy to the precise temperature, humidity, and availability of condensation nuclei required for their formation. However, their ultimate diversity and individual beauty arises from the sensitivity of the crystallization process to small changes in these factors, ensuring that no two snowflakes are quite alike.
