Here is a 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

William Paley's "watchmaker argument" is one of the most famous versions of the design argument for the existence of God. In his book Natural Theology, published in 1802, Paley argues that just as the complexity and functionality of a watch suggests that it must have had a designer, likewise, the complexity and functionality of the universe as a whole suggests that it, too, must have had a designer. However, Paley's version of the design argument faces several serious criticisms that undermine its efficacy. 

One problem is that Paley assumes that complexity and functionality necessarily imply design. However, as David Hume argued, the appearance of design could actually emerge from random chance and the blind forces of nature. Just because something looks designed does not mean that it actually was designed. Apparent design could be an illusion. The universe may seem designed to serve certain complex functions that are hospitable to life, but that could be the result of an unguided evolutionary process, not the result of intentional design.

A second problem is that even if we grant that design is implied, Paley's argument does not establish much about the nature or properties of the designer. The complexity and functionality of the universe could be the result of design by a committee of designers, or by aliens, or by some impersonal pantheistic deity. Paley assumes that the implied designer must have attributes of the Judeo-Christian God, but the argument alone does not establish that. The designer could be quite different.

A third problem is that Paley's argument makes the inference from the particular designs of individual organisms to the design of the universe as a whole. But the design of the universe itself, with all its vast empty space, wastes, and apparent lack of concern for life, does not seem analogous to the complex design of a watch. The universe is mostly cold, empty, and inhospitable to life as we know it. So, the analogy breaks down.

To address these criticisms, Richard Swinburne distinguishes between the temporal order of the universe and its spatial order. The temporal order refers to the causal chains of events that produce certain effects over time. The spatial order refers to the arrangement of matter and energy in space at a given time. Paley focused on the spatial order, but Swinburne argues that the temporal order also suggests evidence of design, because the universe unfolds in a way that is orderly and conducive to producing embodied conscious beings like ourselves. The laws of nature that govern temporal unfolding must be set up in a precise way to allow for this. 

Furthermore, while Paley argued from the particular designs of individual organisms, Swinburne argues from the general laws of nature that govern the entire physical universe, laws that seem fine-tuned to allow for the evolution of life. Swinburne argues that taken together, the temporal and spatial order of the universe suggest, not just apparent design, but actual evidence of intentional design by a deity. By focusing on the temporal order in addition to the spatial order, and by arguing from the general laws of nature rather than particular instances of complexity, Swinburne is able to craft a version of the design argument that avoids many of the criticisms leveled at Paley.

In conclusion, while Paley's version of the design argument from natural theology faces significant problems, Swinburne's approach that considers both the temporal order and spatial order of the universe helps to respond to these concerns and provide a more robust case for the existence of God based on the apparent design in the natural world.
