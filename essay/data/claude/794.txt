The Feature Integration Theory, proposed by Anne Treisman in 1980, suggests that visual attention is required to combine the separate features of an object, such as color, orientation, and shape, into a unified perceptual object. Without focused attention, these features are processed independently and in parallel. The theory proposes that there are two stages of visual processing: an early pre-attentive stage where features are detected automatically in parallel, followed by an attentive stage where the features are integrated into a coherent object through focused attention. 

Treisman and Gelade designed an experiment in 1980 to test this theory. Their experiment used a visual search task to determine if certain features are detected pre-attentively. The experiment displayed a display of letters with a target letter defined by a unique feature, such as the only letter in a different color or shape. The subjects had to scan the display and detect the target letter. It was found that if the target was defined by a single unique feature, such as being the only letter in a different color (e.g. a red X among black Xs), it could be detected very quickly and efficiently without focused attention, suggesting this feature was processed pre-attentively. However, if the target shared that feature but differed in another feature (e.g. a red X among a mix of red Xs and red Os), focused attention was required to integrate the features and detect the target. This would support the distinction between pre-attentive and attentive stages proposed in the Feature Integration Theory.

The results of this experiment supported the Feature Integration Theory. The finding that searches based on a single feature, such as color, were highly efficient whereas searches requiring the binding of multiple features required focused attention matched the theory's proposal of pre-attentive and attentive stages of processing. The pre-attentive stage allowed single features like color to be detected in parallel, but focused attention was required in the attentive stage to integrate the colors and shapes together. This provided evidence that attention is needed to combine separate visual features into a whole object.

In summary, the Feature Integration Theory proposes that visual processing occurs in two stages: an early pre-attentive stage and an attentive stage. The pre-attentive stage detects visual features in parallel automatically, but attention is required in the attentive stage to integrate these separate features into a unified perceptual object. Treisman and Gelade's visual search experiment supported this distinction, finding that searches based on a single unique feature could be detected pre-attentively whereas searches requiring feature integration needed focused attention. The results provided evidence for the role of attention in feature binding and object formation according to the Feature Integration Theory.
