The aim of the laboratory exercises involving Xilinx ISE and Spartan-3 FPGA board was to learn how to use hardware description languages like VHDL to design and implement digital logic circuits on a field programmable gate array or FPGA chip. The purpose of this was to gain experience with carrying out the steps involved in the design cycle - starting from describing the design, simulating and testing it, synthesizing for a target FPGA chip, implementing the design on a FPGA development board and testing and debugging the implementation. 

The hardware elements used were a Xilinx Spartan-3 FPGA development board, a USB cable to connect the board to the PC, Xilinx ISE Design Suite software including tools like Xilinx ISE Project Navigator, and a VHDL editor. The tutorial instructions were followed to create programs for a 2-input AND gate, a 4 bit up counter, a D flip flop and a 7 segment display counter from 0 to 9.

The ANDGATE design was the simplest with just a 2 input AND gate being described in VHDL and simulated to show the expected output. For the 4 bit counter, a synchronous up counter with a max count of 15 was designed and simulated. The Dflipflop had a D flipflop with asynchronous reset described in VHDL and simulated to show its behavior. 

Finally the 7 segment display counter program had a 4 bit up counter driving a 7 segment display decoder and display described in VHDL and simulated for counts from 0 to 9. The programs were then synthesized and implemented on the FPGA board. The results differed from simulation in that there were timing delays and the speeds were slower in the actual hardware implementation. However, the basic intended functionality and behavior of the 4 circuits were as expected and correct.

To summarize, the laboratory exercises achieved the aim of teaching skills involved in FPGA based digital design using VHDL and the Xilinx tools flow from design entry through simulation and implementation on a target FPGA board. Hands-on experience was gained with all steps of the process using some basic introductory digital circuits as examples. The differences between simulation and the actual hardware implementation were also highlighted through these experiments. Overall, the laboratory exercises were very valuable in understanding FPGA design and implementation.
