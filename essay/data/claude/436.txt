The enslavement of Africans in colonial North America was driven by multiple intertwining factors, including racial ideology as well as economic motivations. Both of these factors were absolutely crucial in justifying and enabling the rise of slavery, so it is difficult to say that one was more significant than the other. Without a system of racial stereotyping and categorization to dehumanize Africans, slavery would not have been morally or politically justifiable in colonial societies that valued freedom and equality. But without the demand for cheap labor, especially on plantations, there would not have been an economic incentive to enslave Africans in the first place.  

Racial attitudes were essential in establishing the moral justification for slavery. Europeans developed myths of racial difference that placed Africans at the bottom of a racial hierarchy, as savages unfit for freedom and self-governance. This ideology allowed colonists to rationalize the contradiction between holding human beings in bondage while also valuing liberty. English colonists, in particular, saw Africans as perpetually foreign and inferior, which they used to exclude them from the rights and privileges of English subjects. These racist beliefs were codified in colonial law, which defined slavery as a condition inherited from one's mother, so that the children of enslaved women would be born as slaves. Race-based slavery meant that slavery became a hereditary and permanent condition.

At the same time, economic motivations were a driving factor behind the enslavement of Africans. The establishment of race-based slavery would not have happened without the demand for labor in a capitalist colonial economy increasingly dependent on agriculture, especially plantation crops like tobacco, rice, and indigo. These labor-intensive crops were best suited for large plantations, and planters sought the cheapest available labor to maximize profits. Enslaved Africans and their descendants provided a permanent and exploitable labor source. As the plantation economy expanded in the 18th century, the demand for enslaved labor increased, driving the growth of the transatlantic slave trade.  

While race and economics were inextricably bound together in enabling slavery, on balance the economic motivations were likely more significant in initiating the rise of slavery in North America. The colonists first turned to African slave labor in the 17th century as a pragmatic solution to meet the growing need for cheap labor, especially with the expansion of plantation agriculture. Racist beliefs developed over time to rationalize the brutality of the institution, but slavery was not initially established on the basis of race alone. However, these racist ideologies ultimately became indispensable in sustaining the system and allowing it to expand by denying the humanity of Africans. In conclusion, while both racial attitudes and economic interests were necessary in shaping the origin and growth of slavery, the demand for labor was the primary driving force behind its rise.
