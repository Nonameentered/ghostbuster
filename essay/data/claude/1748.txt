Taboos are cultural prohibitions or restrictions on particular behaviors, objects, or activities. They help reveal what a culture and society views as dangerous, impure, immoral, or antisocial. Taboos often emerge from religious belief systems or long-held customary traditions. By examining the taboos of a culture, we can gain insight into their underlying values and how they classify certain phenomena. 

For example, in Hinduism, certain animals like cattle are considered sacred and it is taboo to kill or eat them. This reveals the importance of cows in Hindu culture and belief. Cows provide milk, dung for fuel and fertilizer, and bullocks for plowing fields, so they play a central role in the agricultural livelihood of many Hindus. The taboo against killing or consuming cattle reflects their exalted status. Other Hindu taboos like prohibitions on eating meat on holy days or during festivals show the link between religious purity and vegetarianism.

In contrast, many Melanesian cultures have strict taboos around menstruation. When women menstruate, they are isolated from men and prohibited from engaging in daily activities or handling and cooking food. All contact with menstrual blood is considered highly polluting. These taboos stem from beliefs that menstrual blood has dangerous spiritual qualities that could contaminate others and affect health and vitality if mishandled or misused. The taboos reveal how Melanesian cultures make strong classifications between purity and pollution, especially regarding gendered bodily functions.   

Taboos often prevail unquestioned in cultures and serve various social functions like establishing moral order or protecting supernatural forces. But they can also be sites of contestation when groups disagree on certain prohibitions. Looking at what is taboo in a culture and what is permitted provides a window into a culture's ontology and view of how different domains of reality should be organized. An exploration of taboos across cultures highlights both the diversity of human cultural expression as well as some common concerns around morality, purity, and danger that shape human cultural systems. Overall, taboos offer a rich field of analysis for understanding cultural classifications and relationships between the human and natural worlds.
