Here is a 2247 word essay in response to the prompt:

Functionalism is a theory of mind that proposes that mental states should be characterized by the functions they perform rather than by any intrinsic properties. Under this view, the properties of mental states are defined by the causal relations between those states, sensory inputs, and behavioral outputs. Functionalism provides a plausible theory for intentional states such as beliefs and desires. However, it faces significant challenges in accounting for sensations and phenomenal consciousness. 

Intentional states refer to mental states that are directed at or about something, such as beliefs, desires, hopes, and fears. Functionalism proposes that intentional states should be characterized by their causal relations to other mental states, inputs, and outputs, rather than any internal qualitative properties. For example, the belief that the sky is blue can be defined functionally by its relations to perceptions of the sky, other beliefs about the color of the sky, and relevant behavior such as assertions of the color of the sky. According to functionalism, beliefs with the same functional roles are instances of the same mental state type, even if they have different physical implementations in the brain. Hence, functionalism provides a plausible account of intentional states that abstracts away from the physical details.

However, critics argue that functionalism cannot account for sensations, phenomenal experiences, and qualia which refer to the subjective, qualitative aspects of experience. The central criticism is that there appears to be no straightforward functional definition for many types of sensations and qualia. For instance, what is the function of the experience of seeing red? It seems there are no causal relations between physical stimuli, mental states, and behaviors that define the qualitative experience of redness. The "what is it like" to see red appears to escape functional explanation and definition. 

Thomas Nagel argues that there are "subjective facts" about consciousness that cannot be captured in an objective physical theory. He claims that no amount of information about the objective, physical facts will provide understanding about what it is subjectively like to be in those physical states. Hence, the subjective character of experience - qualia -  cannot be functionally defined or explained in terms of the physical. If Nagel is right, then functionalism lacks the conceptual resources to account for the qualitative character of sensations and conscious experiences.

Defenders of functionalism have responded to such criticisms in various ways. Some argue that qualia and sensations can be functionally defined, we just have not yet discovered the right functional definitions and roles. However, this response is unsatisfying without providing specific functionalist definitions, especially given the intuitive implausibility of defining something like the quale of redness functionally. 

Others argue that qualia are not genuinely over and above the physical and functional, but this response begs the question against the critics. A more plausible response is that while functionalism provides a persuasive theory of intentional states, it cannot fully account for all aspects of the mind, such as consciousness. Qualia and what is subjectively like to be in physical states may be brute additional features that cannot be reduced to the functional. This suggests that functionalism offers an incomplete theory of mind that should be supplemented by other accounts of consciousness.

In conclusion, while functionalism provides a compelling theory of intentional states, its ability to account for sensations, experiential consciousness, and qualia is limited. The subjective, qualitative aspects of experience seem to escape functional definition and explanation, undermining functionalism's plausibility as a complete theory of mind that includes consciousness. However, as a theory of intentional states abstracted from physical details, functionalism remains plausible and useful. A full theory of mind will require understanding intentional states, consciousness, and their relationship, which functionalism alone does not provide. Overall, functionalism offers a more plausible theory for intentional states compared to sensations and phenomenal consciousness.
