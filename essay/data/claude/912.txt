Here is a 249-word essay response to the given prompt:

A new model for online transactions could incorporate several features to ensure a secure, user-friendly environment with robust fraud prevention. First, a strong authentication method like two-factor authentication should be required for all transactions. This could involve sending a one-time code to a user's phone or email, or using a security key, to verify the user's identity in addition to a password. 

Second, advanced fraud detection algorithms could analyze transactions in real time and flag any suspicious activity. Machine learning models could detect anomalies based on a user's purchase history, location, time of day, and other factors. Transactions that seem fraudulent could then be declined or reviewed manually by a fraud analyst. Users could also set their own rules to detect unauthorized charges.

Third, an intuitive transaction management system for merchants should make it easy to securely accept payments, issue refunds, and maintain customer data privacy. An encrypted payment system with tokenized customer data would ensure that sensitive information is not exposed. Merchants could have a simple interface to review transactions, ensure correct pricing and issue refunds when needed, all while keeping customers' actual account details masked.  

To protect both businesses and consumers, security should be embedded in every step of the transaction process in this new model. With technologies like machine learning advancing rapidly, online payment systems have an opportunity to stay ahead of fraudsters by identifying risky transactions in milliseconds. However, convenience and ease of use must also remain a priority. A system that is too cumbersome or confusing for the average user will not gain mainstream adoption. With strong authentication, next-generation fraud prevention, and an intuitive merchant experience all in place, a new transaction model could give people the confidence to fully embrace online shopping and digital payments.
