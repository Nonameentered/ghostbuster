The economic theory of conflict and peace resolution argues that economic variables such as income, growth, and structure are key determinants in the likelihood of conflict and peace within a country. According to this theory, subjective grievances or ethnic disputes are not sufficient to cause civil war on their own. Rather, economic vulnerabilities or inopportunities that inhibit access to resources or economic mobility are what make conflict more likely, as these situations create incentives to use violence as a means to gain power or wealth.

This economic theory is particularly applicable to understanding conflicts within African nations. Many African countries experience high levels of poverty, weak economic growth, and a dependence on primary commodity exports – all factors that the economic theory associates with a higher risk of civil war. For example, the Collier-Hoeffler model, an econometric model analyzing factors that contribute to civil war, found that low income, slow economic growth, and primary commodity exports were strongly correlated with civil war onset in African countries.

The reasoning behind these correlations is that poverty and lack of economic opportunity give individuals incentives to gain power and money through violent means, rather than through legal economic activity. In poor countries with slow growth, legal methods of acquiring wealth and status may seem very limited, making violence appear more attractive. Dependence on primary commodity exports also creates a prize to fight over - the opportunity to control those resources - and the revenues from these exports make it possible to fund armed conflict. These findings support the economic theory of conflict by showing that economic motivations, more so than ethnic or ideological factors alone, drive individuals and groups to engage in violence.

Subjective grievances, while potent in the rhetoric and messaging of civil wars, are not sufficient independent causal factors according to the economic theory. As political scientist Paul Collier argues, “civil wars require both motive and opportunity.” Economic conditions shape the opportunity and feasibility of civil war, while subjective grievances such as ethnic or religious divisions may shape the rhetoric to motivate and justify violence. But grievances alone are rarely enough; there must be some economic incentive or opportunity that makes armed conflict appear a viable or attractive option.

The economic theory also applies to understanding paths to peace. Collier argues that “economic opportunities for predation must be reduced” to make peace sustainable. Peace agreements and political settlements may address grievances and power-sharing, but they ultimately must also restructure the economy and incentives to make peace more profitable than war for potential combatants. This could involve diversifying the economy away from dependence on primary commodity exports, increasing economic growth and opportunities, and redistributing wealth and resources to address poverty. Such changes can make peace self-enforcing by giving former combatants a stake in a stable and prosperous post-war order.

In conclusion, the economic theory of conflict applies deeply to civil wars in Africa. Poverty, slow growth, and commodity dependence have created incentives and opportunities for violence according to economists like Collier. While grievances and ethnic divisions are often cited in these conflicts, the economic theory suggests that political disputes alone would not necessarily lead to armed violence without economic motivations that make conflict feasible and potentially profitable. To build sustainable peace, then, political solutions must be paired with economic reforms and development that can change the incentives and logic of violence into incentives and logic favoring peace.
