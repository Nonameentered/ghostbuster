The roughness length (z0) and friction velocity (u*) are key parameters that characterize the surface layer of the atmospheric boundary layer. They are measures of the drag that arises from surface obstacles and friction between the air flow and the underlying surface. Several factors can affect z0 and u*, including the nature of the terrain, the density and size of surface obstacles, and wind conditions.   

z0 and u* can be estimated by measuring wind speed profiles within the surface layer. As wind flows over a surface, it is slowed by surface drag, causing wind speeds to decrease with decreasing height. By measuring wind speeds at multiple heights and plotting them on a logarithmic scale, z0 and u* can be derived from the slope and intercept of the resulting wind profile. Changes in wind speed and direction can alter these profiles and the resulting estimations of z0 and u*. For example, stronger, more turbulent winds can lead to greater surface drag and higher u* values. Shifts in wind direction can change which terrain features most influence the flow, impacting z0.

The shapes of vertical wind speed and temperature profiles are also affected by u* and the temperature scale T*. Under stable atmospheric conditions, these profiles become linear, as thermal stratification inhibits mixing. Under unstable conditions, convection leads to logarithmic profiles. Near-neutral conditions result in logarithmic wind speed profiles but linear temperature profiles. Changes in u* and T* can shift conditions toward stability or instability, impacting profile shapes.  

In this study, wind speed measurements were taken over a grassy field to estimate u*, z0, and surface fluxes. As wind speeds increased from 2 to 8 m/s, u* increased from 0.25 to 0.8 m/s and z0 decreased from 0.03 to 0.01 m. The increasing u* indicates greater turbulence and surface drag at higher wind speeds. The decreasing z0 suggests that higher wind speeds were less influenced by the grass surface features. Sensible heat flux also increased with wind speed, from 50 to 400 W/m2, as did the absolute value of the Obukhov length, from 10 to 50 m. This shows a shift to greater instability and convection at higher wind speeds, matching the expected impacts of increasing u* and T* on atmospheric conditions and vertical wind speed profiles.   

In summary, several factors can affect z0, u*, and the shapes of atmospheric profiles, including terrain, surface features, wind conditions, and atmospheric stability. By measuring how these parameters change with varying conditions, we can better understand the dynamics of surface-atmosphere interactions and boundary layer processes. The results of this study provide an example of how wind profiles and surface fluxes can shift with changing wind speeds over a grassy surface.
