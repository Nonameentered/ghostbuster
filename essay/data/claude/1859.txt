The book My Book tells the story of the murder of a famous stage actor, Geoffrey Harold. Detective Adam Belmayne is tasked with solving the murder mystery. The book opens at a lavish party being thrown to celebrate the opening night of Geoffrey Harold’s new play. The actor is at the height of his fame and success. During the middle of the party, Harold’s personal assistant finds him dead in his dressing room. It appears he has been stabbed to death.

Detective Belmayne is called in to investigate the murder. He begins by interviewing the guests and staff at the party. No one claims to have seen or heard anything out of the ordinary. Belmayne discovers that there are many possible suspects and motives. Harold had a reputation for being a difficult and demanding boss. Several of the staff and actors resented how Harold treated them. Belmayne also learns that Harold was a notorious womanizer and had relationships with several of the actresses in the play. Any of them could have motive for killing Harold in a fit of jealousy or rage.  

Belmayne interviews Harold’s wife and personal assistant but both seem genuinely shocked and saddened at the news of his death. Belmayne is struggling to find a breakthrough in the case. He decides to reexamine the crime scene to look for any missed clues. After a careful search of Harold’s dressing room, Belmayne notices something that catches his eye – a single strand of red cloth stuck under the dressing table. Belmayne deduces this must have come from the killer’s clothing during a struggle. The discovery of the red cloth gives Belmayne the first big break in the case.

Belmayne interviews all the suspects again and closely examines their clothing. He notices that the costume designer, Edith Forsooth, is wearing a dress with red trim that looks like it is missing a strand of cloth. Belmayne questions Forsooth intensely about her whereabouts during the time of the murder...
