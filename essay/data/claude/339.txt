Here is a 999-word essay in response to the prompt:

The hemispheric asymmetry hypothesis posits that the left and right hemispheres of the brain specialize in processing different types of semantic information in the mental lexicon. Specifically, the left hemisphere is thought to be more associated with abstract, categorical relations, while the right hemisphere is suggested to rely more on object similarity. This theory can be investigated in split-brain patients, where the corpus callosum connecting the hemispheres has been severed. 

In single split-brain patients, each hemisphere can be tested independently to determine its semantic organization. For example, the patient can be shown pictures of objects in each visual field, tapping into either the left or right hemisphere, and asked to group the objects. The left hemisphere may group taxonomically related objects like fruits together, while the right hemisphere groups objects based on visual feature overlap like round shapes. This double dissociation in semantic grouping by categorical versus visual relations would support the hemispheric asymmetry hypothesis.

However, opposing views argue that both hemispheres utilize both types of semantic relations, just to different extents. The semantic space model suggests that meaning is represented by the distance between concepts in a multidimensional space, spanning both categorical and feature-based axes. Both hemispheres can access the full semantic space, they just weight each dimension differently. The right hemisphere may weight visual feature similarity more, while the left weights categorical relatedness more, but both types of relations are present to some degree in each hemisphere.

The false memory paradigm provides a way to test these opposing views. In this method, lists of associates to a single word, like "sleep", are presented to each hemisphere independently. The left hemisphere may falsely recall more categorical associates like "bed" or "rest", while the right recalls more visual feature associates like "dark" or "moon". However, both hemispheres may show some degree of false recall across types of associates, suggesting some access to both categorical and visual semantics in each hemisphere, in line with the semantic space model.

Previous research has been limited to small samples of mostly male, right-handed split-brain patients. A new study with a larger, more diverse sample and more sophisticated methods is needed to find the proposed double dissociation. Controlling for individual differences in language dominance and semantic ability across hemispheres can help clarify the roles of each hemisphere in representing different types of semantic relations.

In summary, the hemispheric asymmetry hypothesis suggests that the left and right hemispheres of the split brain rely on categorical versus visual semantic organization, respectively. Evidence from single case studies of semantic grouping and false memories can support this view, but may also reflect more graded differences in how each hemisphere weights these types of semantic information rather than mutually exclusive specialization. Improved methodology addressing previous limitations can help determine whether hemispheric differences reflect dichotomous asymmetry or a shared, multidimensional semantic space accessed to differing degrees.
