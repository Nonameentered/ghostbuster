Gabriela Mistral's poem "La Tierra" from her 1924 poetry collection Ternura examines the themes of maternal love, nature, and indigenous culture. The poem contrasts these themes with the growing emphasis on urbanization and metropolitan life that was profoundly reshaping Chilean society in the early 20th century. 

Mistral opens the poem by invoking the earth as a nurturing mother figure through the metaphor of "Madre Tierra." She portrays the earth as a source of unconditional love and nourishment, "like a mother's milk that knows no measure." This depiction of the maternal earth is contrasted with the "stone breasts" of the modern city, suggesting that urban life lacks the warmth, sustenance, and maternal care provided by nature.

The poem goes on to celebrate the beauty of the natural world, from the "blue canopy" of the sky to the "silver foam" of waterfalls and the "emerald boughs" of trees. Mistral writes with a sense of nostalgia for a simpler life closely tied to the land. She refers to scattered rural villages, humble adobe huts, and peasants tilling the soil. These representations of a traditional agrarian lifestyle stand in contrast to the sophistication and pretensions of city life in early 20th-century Chile.

Mistral also incorporates indigenous cultural references into the poem, such as allusions to Mapuche textiles and mythology. She refers to the "ancient, sacred loom" of the land, weaving together natural and cultural elements. These references to Chile's indigenous roots highlight Mistral's view that modernization and urban cosmopolitanism were detrimental to cultural traditions. They represented a loss of identity and connection to place.

Overall, "La Tierra" can be read as a critique of the rapid pace of change in Chilean society during Mistral's time. Through lyrical tributes to nature, motherhood, and indigenous culture, the poem suggests these were being lost or devalued in the push for progress and development. It is a call to remember what is most sacred and cherish the sources of life, nourishment, identity and spiritual connection in the land and its ancient roots. This perspective was groundbreaking for a female poet at the time and highlights Mistral's role as a social critic advocating for marginalized groups and ways of life.

In conclusion, Gabriela Mistral's "La Tierra" uses the themes of maternal nature, indigenous culture, and rural life as a poetic protest against the detrimental forces of urbanization and modernity in early 20th-century Chile. The poem is a reminder of what is most essential to human society and nourishment, conveyed through a powerful, distinctively female voice.
