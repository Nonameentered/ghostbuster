Here is a draft 2250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Micro-nutrients such as vitamins and minerals are essential to human health and development. Deficiencies in micro-nutrients can lead to a range of health issues, including stunted growth, increased susceptibility to disease, and even blindness and premature death in severe cases. Historically, micro-nutrient deficiencies were more widespread due to lack of access to a diverse diet and limited knowledge about nutrition. Industrialization and food globalization have made a variety of foods more widely available in most parts of the world. 

However, some micro-nutrient deficiencies persist due to a range of factors. For example, diets high in processed foods and low in whole foods can contribute to lack of certain micro-nutrients like folate or magnesium. Targeted fortification of staple foods  with specific micro-nutrients has been shown to effectively address some deficiencies when access to diverse diets is limited. For example, adding iodine to salt, folate to wheat flour, and vitamin D to dairy products has improved public health.

Food fortification is one approach to solving micro-nutrient deficiencies that has been implemented globally. It is a cost-effective way to reach populations at risk of deficiency since staple foods are already widely consumed. Theadditional costs of fortifying foods are often minor when implemented at an industrial scale. Food fortification has been successful at nearly eliminating certain deficiencies, such as goiter from iodine deficiency and rickets from vitamin D deficiency. However, food fortification also has some potential downsides. For some nutrients, it may be difficult to add enough to meet nutritional needs without compromising taste or food quality. There is also a risk of excessive intake of some nutrients if multiple foods are fortified or nutrition is also obtained from dietary supplements. Regulation and monitoring of fortification programs are needed to mitigate these risks.

An alternative approach is the development of "functional foods" fortified with micro-nutrients beyond amounts needed to correct a deficiency. These products, like calcium-fortified orange juice or probiotic yogurt, are aimed at promoting health benefits rather than just preventing deficiencies. While functional foods may appeal to health-conscious consumers, some concerns have been raised about their efficacy and potential for misleading health claims. For some micro-nutrients, the health benefits of consuming more than the minimum requirement are not well-established.

In conclusion, fortifying staple foods can be an effective approach to addressing micro-nutrient deficiencies when access to nutritious whole foods is limited. Food fortification has a proven record of success at reducing or eliminating deficiencies of nutrients like iodine, folate, and vitamin D at a population level. However, to be most effective, food fortification programs need to be carefully designed and monitored to ensure nutritional needs are met without increased risk of overconsumption or nutrient imbalance. Functional foods, while appealing to some, should be subject to greater scrutiny regarding potential health claims to avoid misleading consumers.

A balanced diet of nutritious whole foods remains the best approach for obtaining not just micro-nutrients but the range of benefits that foods can provide. However, in the context of modern lifestyles and dependence on highly processed convenience foods, purposefully adding essential micro-nutrients back into the food supply through targeted fortification and functional foods may be needed to support optimal health and nutrition. Overall, micro-nutrient fortification has an important role to play but should not be seen as a substitute for eating a healthy diet.
