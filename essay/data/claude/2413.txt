Here is a draft 750 word essay response to the prompt:

The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem in computational complexity. It involves finding the shortest possible tour that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city. This problem arises frequently in logistics and transportation as companies attempt to find the most efficient routes for deliveries and travel. 

To calculate the number of possible paths in a TSP, we can use the factorial function. For example, if a salesperson needs to visit 4 cities, the number of possible paths is 4! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24. For 10 cities, the permutations explode to over 3 million. As the number of cities increases, the number of possible paths grows enormously. Clearly, brute force searches will not work for large TSPs.

Algorithms such as simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and ant colony optimization can be used to find high-quality solutions to the TSP in a reasonable time frame. These algorithms explore the large solution space intelligently by applying heuristics that imitate natural phenomena. They can often find the optimal path or get very close to it. For the 4-city TSP, the shortest possible path is 6 (A->B->C->D->A). 

The TSP belongs to the class of NP-complete problems, meaning that while solutions can be verified quickly, finding an optimal solution is intractable. However, approximate solutions are often good enough for most real-world purposes. Solving NP-complete problems is crucial for many applications such as planning, scheduling, manufacturing, genomics, and transportation. Approximation algorithms and heuristics allow these problems to be solved with reasonable time and resources.

In conclusion, the travelling salesman problem is a classic intractable problem that seeks the shortest path between multiple cities. Factorial growth in the number of permutations makes brute force searches infeasible. Algorithmic techniques like simulated annealing can find high-quality solutions in a reasonable time. Solving difficult NP-complete problems enables many important applications even when optimal solutions cannot be obtained. The TSP will likely remain an active area of research in computer science and mathematics.
