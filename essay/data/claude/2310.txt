Here is a 2000 word essay on the role of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) in embryonic development:

The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in embryonic development across many species.  Shh is a secreted protein that acts as a morphogen, providing positional information to guide the growth and differentiation of cells and tissues. Shh signaling helps establish the basic body plan and the development of major organ systems in the early embryo.

One of the earliest roles of Shh is in the establishment of the dorsal-ventral axis.  In the early embryo, Shh is secreted from the notochord and floor plate in the ventral side of the neural tube. It helps determine cell fate in the spinal cord, with high Shh signaling specifying ventral progenitor cells and low signaling specifying dorsal progenitor cells. This helps establish the distinct dorsal and ventral regions of the spinal cord, which give rise to different types of neurons. 

Shh signaling also plays a key role in limb development.  Shh produced by the zone of polarizing activity at the posterior margin of the limb bud helps establish the anterior-posterior axis of the limb.  High Shh signaling specifies the development of posterior digits in the limb, while lower signaling specifies the anterior digits. This helps properly pattern the digits in the limb. Shh signaling is also essential for the outgrowth and patterning of bones and joints in the limb.

In the developing brain, Shh signaling is essential for the patterning of the ventral diencephalon into the thalamus and hypothalamus. Shh also plays an important role in the emergence and migration of various neuronal populations in the cortex, midbrain, and hindbrain. Disruption of Shh signaling can lead to holoprosencephaly, in which the forebrain fails to divide into left and right hemispheres.

Shh signaling is also essential for the development of various organs.  In the gut, Shh helps specify the fate of endodermal progenitors that give rise to the stomach, pancreas, liver, lungs, and intestines.  In the eye, Shh signaling helps establish the ventral retina and plays a role in the development of the lens and cornea. Shh is also important for kidney development and the patterning of teeth in the jaw.

In summary, Shh signaling plays a remarkably conserved role in establishing the basic body plan and organ systems across species during embryonic development.  Through its function as a morphogen, Shh provides positional information to guide cell fate determination, axis formation, tissue patterning, and organogenesis.  Disruption of the Shh pathway can lead to severe birth defects, highlighting its essential role in early development.
