The anti-poll tax riots of 1990 in London were the result of a confluence of factors, including the imposition of an unfair tax policy, economic anxiety and hardship among working-class Londoners, and government indifference to public concerns. Several sociological theories of crowd behavior help shed light on the dynamics and escalation of the protests.

In 1989, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government decided to impose a flat-rate per capita "community charge" on all individuals, known as the poll tax, to replace local property taxes in funding local governments. The tax shifted more of the tax burden onto lower-income individuals. Poorer households were hit much harder by the tax compared to wealthy households. There was widespread opposition to the policy across the country, but the government proceeded to implement the tax starting in Scotland in 1989 and in England and Wales in 1990.

The economic conditions in Britain at the time were also creating hardships, especially for the working class in London and other cities. Unemployment in London reached over 10% in 1990 and many people were struggling economically. The imposition of the poll tax added further financial burdens at a time when people could ill afford it. The tax was seen as deeply unfair and regressive.

The government failed to address public concerns about the policy or make any concessions. This indifference and unwillingness to listen to citizens or consider alternative policies fueled resentment and anger. Protests began to emerge and became larger and more frequent over time. Peaceful marches turned increasingly confrontational, culminating in the riots of March 1990. According to emergent norm theory, crowds can develop their own norms that lead to increasingly extreme behaviors. Shared anger and frustration within the crowd, combined with a lack of restraint, fueled the escalation to property destruction and violence. 

Contagion theory also helps explain how emotions and behaviors spread rapidly within the crowd. As some protesters began to act violently and aggressively, others followed and imitated them, spreading confrontational and destructive actions. The anonymity of the crowd also reduced individual restraint and accountability, according to deindividuation theory. The culmination of these dynamics led to the emergence of a protest that spun out of control and turned into a riot, resulting in hundreds of injuries and arrests.

In conclusion, the anti-poll tax riots were the product of an unpopular policy, economic hardship, government unresponsiveness, and crowd dynamics that led to the escalation of anger and violence. A variety of sociological theories help demonstrate how crowds can take on a life of their own when frustrations are high and restraints are low. The poll tax riots marked a pivotal moment of social unrest and signaled the downfall of Margaret Thatcher shortly thereafter.
