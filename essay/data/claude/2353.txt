The dimerization equilibrium is an important consideration when measuring the photolytic dissociation of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) using the Lambert-Beer law. The Lambert-Beer law states that the absorbance of a solution is directly proportional to the concentration of the absorbing species in the solution. However, in the case of NO2, the species present in solution include both NO2 monomers and NO2 dimers, which also absorb light. Thus, the total absorbance measured will be affected by both the monomer and dimer concentrations. To accurately determine the concentration of NO2 monomers from absorbance measurements, the dimerization equilibrium must be considered and accounted for. 

NO2 monomers can reversibly form dimers by combining two molecules, with the dimerization equilibrium expression 2NO2 ⇌ N2O4. The extent to which NO2 forms dimers depends on several factors, including temperature, pressure, and concentration. At room temperature, the equilibrium lies predominantly to the left, favoring the monomer. However, as the NO2 concentration increases, the formation of dimers becomes more favorable. The dimer, N2O4, also absorbs light at similar wavelengths as the NO2 monomer.  So when taking an absorbance reading for a solution of NO2 at a given concentration, the total absorbance will be the sum from both the monomers and dimers present. 

To calculate the concentration of NO2 monomers ([NO2]) from the total absorbance, the contributions of the monomers and dimers must be separated. This can be done using the equilibrium constant for the dimerization reaction, which depends on temperature and can be expressed as Keq = [N2O4] / ([NO2]2). By measuring the total absorbance at multiple NO2 concentrations, a plot can be constructed of total absorbance vs. [NO2]total. The slope of this line is equal to the extinction coefficient (ε) for the NO2 monomer. The intercept of the line provides information about the dimer contribution, and once the extinction coefficient for N2O4 is known, the dimer concentration at each point can be determined using the Beer-Lambert law.   

Subtracting the dimer contribution from the total absorbance at each NO2 concentration yields the absorbance due solely to monomers, and a plot of this monomer absorbance vs. [NO2]total will yield a linear relationship with a slope of ε for the monomer. From this linear relationship, the concentration of NO2 monomers can be determined for any measured absorbance. Additionally, at high enough NO2 concentrations, the absorbance from dimers becomes negligible in comparison to the total absorbance, so the total absorbance can be interpreted as direct measure of the monomer concentration without the need for dimer correction. 

In summary, the dimerization equilibrium of nitrogen dioxide must be accounted for when measuring NO2 monomer concentrations using absorbance spectroscopy. By measuring the absorbance of solutions at varying total NO2 concentrations, the separate contributions of monomers and dimers can be differentiated using the equilibrium constant and Beer-Lambert law. With the appropriate corrections, the total absorbance can be converted into concentrations of just the nitrogen dioxide monomer. At high NO2 concentrations, the impact of dimers becomes insignificant, simplifying analysis. Compensating for the dimerization equilibrium is critical for accurately measuring photolytic dissociation of NO2 and determining rate constants using absorbance spectroscopy.
