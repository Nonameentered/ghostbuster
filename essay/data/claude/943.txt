Here is a 503 word essay response to the prompt:

Modulating a carrier signal using an analogue multiplier involves combining the carrier signal with the information-carrying modulating signal. The amplitude, frequency or phase of the carrier signal is varied in accordance with the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal. This results in frequency components representing the sum and difference of the carrier and modulating frequencies, enabling the transmission of information.

A simple modulation technique is Double-Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSB/SC). Here, a balanced modulator suppresses the carrier, leaving only the sidebands containing the modulation signal. Although spectrum efficient, the carrier suppression makes demodulation difficult. A pilot tone, an unmodulated tone at the carrier frequency, is added to the DSB/SC signal to assist in coherent demodulation. The pilot tone provides a frequency reference to regenerate the carrier for demodulation.

For a cascaded amplifier system, the noise figure depends on the gain and noise of individual amplifier stages, and the positioning of filters. The noise figure can be optimized by placing high gain, low noise amplifiers at the input, followed by filters. This minimizes the noise contributed by subsequent amplifiers. Wideband amplifiers should be placed before narrowband amplifiers and filters, to provide most gain before bandwidth is reduced. Narrowband filters and low gain amplifiers should be at the output, since the signal has been amplified before filtering and less gain is required. 

In summary, modulating an analogue carrier signal involves using a multiplier to modulate the amplitude, frequency or phase of the carrier in accordance with the modulating signal. DSB/SC suppresses the carrier but requires a pilot tone to assist demodulation. For cascaded amplifiers, noise optimization involves placing high gain, low noise amplifiers and wideband filters at the input, with narrowband components and low gain stages at the output.
