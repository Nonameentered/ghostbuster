Here is a 749-word essay in response to the prompt:

The 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States sent shockwaves through the global economy in 2001, including significantly impacting Brazil. Several external factors, including a decline in global trade and investment flows as well as falling commodity prices, contributed to a sharp slowdown in Brazil's GDP growth that year. 

Brazil's economy is heavily dependent on exports of commodities like soybeans, iron ore, and coffee. In 2001, commodity prices fell sharply due to declining global demand. The price of soybeans dropped over 25% from 2000 to 2001, iron ore fell 35%, and coffee declined over 40% during the same period. These price drops significantly reduced export revenues for Brazil and hurt its terms of trade. Export volumes also declined in 2001, falling 5% year over year.

Global foreign direct investment flows fell in 2001, declining over 50% from 2000 levels according to UNCTAD. Brazil was not immune to this trend, experiencing a drop of over 40% in FDI inflows in 2001. This fall in investment spending contributed to the economic slowdown. Foreign investors were wary and risk-averse following the 9/11 attacks, especially when it came to emerging markets like Brazil.

The 9/11 attacks caused a disruption to global trade flows and air travel, which impacted tourism revenues in Brazil. The U.S. also entered a short recession, which reduced demand for Brazilian exports to its largest trading partner. Brazil's close linkages to the U.S. economy made it vulnerable to the post-9/11 U.S. downturn. 

All of these external factors contributed to a sharp deceleration in Brazil's GDP growth from 4.4% in 2000 to only 1.4% in 2001. The industrial production growth rate turned negative, consumer confidence declined, and unemployment rose. The government responded with increased government spending, tax cuts, lower interest rates, and an expanded social safety net.

In summary, the 9/11 attacks had a significant indirect impact on the Brazilian economy in 2001 through declining global trade, falling commodity prices, lower investment flows, and a U.S. recession. Brazil's heavy reliance on exports of commodities and close ties to the U.S. economy made it particularly susceptible to these external shocks. The government took action with fiscal and monetary stimulus to counteract the resulting GDP slowdown, but growth still decelerated significantly in 2001 due to events outside of Brazil's control.
