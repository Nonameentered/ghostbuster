Thomas Hobbes and John Locke were two of the most influential political philosophers of the 17th century. Both men considered the "state of nature" as a way to explore human nature and the proper role and structure of government. However, Hobbes and Locke had very different conceptions of the state of nature that led them to different conclusions about human nature and the social contract. 

For Hobbes, the state of nature was a state of perpetual war and conflict. In his work Leviathan, Hobbes argued that in the state of nature each person has "a right to every thing, even to one anothers body." There are no shared moral rules and no way to enforce contracts or secure property. Each person seeks to maximize their own power and gain. This leads to a war of "every man against every man." Life in the state of nature is "solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short."

Given this bleak view of human nature and the state of nature, Hobbes believed that a strong sovereign power was necessary to establish order and security. Individuals form a social contract and establish the sovereign to escape the state of nature. They give up most of their rights and liberties to the sovereign who then has nearly absolute authority to maintain peace. For Hobbes, the state of nature demonstrates that human nature is self-interested and chaotic, and this requires an all-powerful sovereign to restrain people's base impulses.

Locke had a very different view of human nature and the state of nature. For Locke, the state of nature is a state of perfect freedom and equality. People have natural rights to life, liberty, and property. They are governed by natural law and reason. The state of nature is not necessarily a state of war, though there are inconveniences in the absence of a common judge and authority.

Locke argued that people form governments and establish social contracts to better secure their natural rights, not because human nature demands it. Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. Locke's view of human nature is that people are fundamentally reasonable, moral, and capable of cooperation. They can judge and punish transgressions of the natural law. Government is established through majority consent to authorize protection of rights and property.

In summary, Hobbes and Locke differed sharply in their views of human nature and the state of nature. Hobbes saw humans as self-interested and chaotic, demanding a nearly absolute sovereign. Locke saw humans as reasonable, moral, and able to cooperate, creating government by consent to secure natural rights. These differing premises led to very different conclusions about the social contract and the proper structure of government. Comparing the philosophies of Hobbes and Locke provides insight into the contrasting assumptions about human nature that underlie authoritarian and liberal political thought.
