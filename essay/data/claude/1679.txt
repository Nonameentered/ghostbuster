Recruitment and selection are crucial human resource management (HRM) practices in the hospitality and tourism industry to attract and hire suitable employees. The industry faces unique challenges due to its characteristics such as seasonality, high employee turnover, and the service-oriented nature of work. HRM strategies aim to achieve person-organization fit and person-job fit to maximize employee productivity, commitment, and job satisfaction. However, a balance is needed between objectivity and subjectivity in the recruitment and selection methods to avoid discrimination. The right mix of methods depends on the HRM strategies of individual organizations. Training and development also play an essential role in enhancing the effectiveness of recruitment and selection. 

The hospitality and tourism industry relies heavily on effective recruitment and selection to account for the seasonal fluctuation in labor demands and high employee turnover. Job advertisements, employee referrals, and recruitment agencies are commonly used to reach a large pool of applicants. Screening tools such as resumes, interviews, background checks, and psychometric tests help assess applicants’ job-related skills, abilities, and fit with the organization’s culture. The interview, in particular, is a key selection method as it provides an opportunity for a two-way exchange of information to determine mutual suitability. However, interviews can be subjective, inconsistent, and prone to discrimination. Structured interviews with multiple interviewers and scoring techniques help increase objectivity and validity.

HRM strategies aim for person-organization fit and person-job fit to achieve high productivity, commitment, and job satisfaction. Cultural fit is especially important in the hospitality and tourism industry where employees interact closely with customers and colleagues. However, an overemphasis on cultural fit may lead to discrimination against minorities. A balance of objectivity and subjectivity is needed in recruitment and selection. Standardized tests and structured interviews introduce objectivity, while unstructured interviews provide contextual information to assess applicants holistically. Each organization needs to determine the right mix of methods based on its HRM strategies and values.

The characteristics of the hospitality and tourism industry present both opportunities and challenges for recruitment and selection. Seasonality results in fluctuating labor demands, necessitating flexible employment practices such as part-time and seasonal workers. The service-oriented nature of work requires applicants with strong customer service skills and work ethic. However, the low pay and long or unsociable working hours lead to high employee turnover. Recruitment and selection strategies aim to manage these challenges through, for example, internal mobility programs, realistic job previews, and emphasizing career growth opportunities.  

In conclusion, current practices in recruitment and selection in the hospitality and tourism industry aim to achieve employee fit and match business needs. A balanced and customized approach is needed for each organization to maximize objectivity while assessing cultural fit. Close alignments between recruitment and selection with training and development also support organizations in overcoming industry challenges such as seasonality and high turnover. Both commitment and productivity are equally important for service quality and business performance. Overall, effective recruitment and selection are crucial for the success and competitiveness of hospitality and tourism organizations.
