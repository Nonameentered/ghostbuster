The practice of tilling soil in the autumn before winter, often called fall plowing or autumn tillage, can have significant effects on litter decomposition and soil biota in the following spring and growing season. Mulligan et al. (2004) conducted an experiment to examine how autumn tillage affected litter decomposition and soil invertebrate populations in spring. They found that tillage in the fall accelerated decomposition of wheat straw litter placed on the soil surface over winter by up to 50% compared to untilled control plots. 

This increased rate of decomposition could be attributed to several factors. First, the physical mixing and redistribution of litter that resulted from plowing increased exposure of more surface area to decomposers and the elements. Second, turnover and aeration of the soil provided better conditions for the decomposer community over winter. And third, the straw was incorporated into the soil, putting it in closer proximity to soil microbes and invertebrates that could break it down.

In terms of soil biota, Mulligan et al. (2004) found that populations of enchytraeid worms, microarthropods, and nematodes were generally higher in the tilled plots relative to untilled controls in the spring following treatment. The only statistically significant outcome was for enchytraeid worms, which were 80-95% more abundant in the tilled versus untilled treatments. The lack of statistical significance for other groups could have been due to high variability in the data and small sample sizes. A larger, replicated study may have yielded definitive results.

There are some potential issues with the experimental design that could have introduced bias. First, litterbags used to track decomposition were placed on the soil surface, unlike the straw that was incorporated into the tilled soil. This may have impacted microbial and invertebrate access to litter in the bags versus unincorporated straw. Second, the time of sampling in spring may have missed peak abundances for some organisms or coincided with a lull in decomposition. Additional sampling in autumn and summer could provide more complete data.

In terms of implications, this study and others suggest that tillage prior to winter can strongly impact soil ecosystem functioning by stimulating decomposition and temporarily boosting soil food web populations and activity. Agricultural practices that minimize soil disturbance, especially over winter, may help preserve soil structure and moisture, reduce erosion, and support soil biodiversityâ€”though they may slow the release of nutrients for subsequent crops. Additional research should explore how changing tillage regimens, use of cover crops, and crop rotations interact to affect soil biology, health, carbon storage, and crop productivity. Overall, balancing agricultural production and long-term soil sustainability remains an important challenge.
