The Intensive Observation Period (IOP) was a field campaign conducted as part of the Coordinated Energy and Water Cycle Observations Project (CEOP) to better understand land surface-atmosphere interactions and the surface energy balance. The purpose of the IOP was to collect high temporal resolution data on the key variables that govern the surface energy balance for a two-week period over multiple sites with different climate regimes and land cover types. The measured variables included: incoming and reflected shortwave radiation, incoming and outgoing longwave radiation, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, ground heat flux, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, precipitation, and soil moisture.  

The incoming shortwave radiation was measured using pyranometers, which measure the total solar radiation across a hemisphere. The reflected shortwave radiation was measured with the same instruments but facing opposite the incoming radiation. The incoming and outgoing longwave radiation were measured using pyrgeometers, which measure radiation in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The sensible heat flux was calculated using eddy covariance systems, which measure high frequency wind speeds and temperatures to determine vertical heat exchange. The latent heat flux was also determined through eddy covariance by measuring humidity fluctuations and molecular diffusivity. Ground heat flux was measured using heat flux plates placed at multiple depths in the soil.

All instrumentation has sources of error which can impact the measured values. For radiation measurements, the instruments can be sensitive to changes in temperature, barometric pressure and humidity inside the instrument. Eddy covariance estimates of turbulent fluxes can be subject to errors from inadequate sampling of eddies, spectral loss at high and low frequencies, and impacts from weather conditions like heavy rain. Soil heat flux plate measurements require accurate measurements of changing soil moisture and temperature at multiple depths, which can be difficult to achieve. 

There are four primary mechanisms through which energy is exchanged at the Earth's surface: radiation, conduction, convection, and evapotranspiration. Net radiation is the dominant mechanism and includes the absorption and emission of shortwave and longwave radiation. Conduction refers to the diffusion of heat through the soil, which is measured by the ground heat flux. Convection is the turbulent mixing of heat and moisture through the movement of air, such as that measured by the sensible heat flux. Evapotranspiration is the transfer of heat when water changes state from liquid to gas, such as that measured by the latent heat flux.

Understanding the surface energy balance is critical because it determines the amount of energy available to power atmospheric circulation, weather systems, and climate. The intensity of the water cycle is also strongly dependent on the surface energy balance through the process of evapotranspiration. Changes to the Earth's surface, such as deforestation or urbanization, can significantly alter the surface energy balance with impacts to temperature, precipitation, and weather extremes. The IOP provided valuable data to improve our understanding of land surface-atmosphere interactions across a diversity of climate zones and surface types. Overall, the IOP was key to advancing knowledge of the Earth system and improving weather and climate prediction models.
