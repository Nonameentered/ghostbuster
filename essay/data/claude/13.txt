Georg Simmel's approach to sociology differs significantly from that of Ã‰mile Durkheim. While Durkheim focused on how social facts shape individuals and society, Simmel examined social interactions at a micro level and how complex social forms emerge from these basic interactions. Central to Simmel's perspective is his concept of "forms of sociation," referring to the patterns of interactions that constitute social relationships and social structures. For Simmel, the content of specific interactions mattered less than their form and pattern. This separation between form and content allowed Simmel to see society as the product of ongoing reciprocal interactions between individuals following established social forms. 

Simmel's focus on forms of sociation and microsocial interactions leads to a view of society as highly fluid, complex, and diverse. Social relations and structures are temporary configurations that arise from interactions, not externally imposed on individuals. This perspective differs from Durkheim's view of society as an objective reality that shapes the individual. For Simmel, society is constructed from the bottom up through interactions, not the top down through social facts. His microlevel approach aimed to understand the genesis and dynamics of social forms, not take them as given like Durkheim.

However, Simmel's focus on the micro elements of society also limits his theory. By reducing society to interactions and forms of sociation, Simmel overlooks the bigger picture of social structures and institutions. This becomes especially apparent in his essay "The Metropolis and Mental Life," where he examines how social interactions in cities differ from rural areas. While Simmel insightfully notes how city life fosters more reserved and calculating social interactions, he fails to relate these microsocial observations to broader structures like social class or economy. His theory remains too reductionist, even if capturing important elements of social dynamics.  

In conclusion, Simmel's sociology offers a valuable microsocial perspective, complementing Durkheim's more macro approach. Simmel's focus on diverse social forms arising from interactions provides a nuanced view of society as fluid, complex and multilayered. However, by remaining at the micro level, Simmel's reductionism also limits his theory. Examining both the micro and the macro, as many later sociologists aimed to do, provides the most comprehensive understanding of society and social dynamics. Both Simmel and Durkheim's theories thus offer strengths, as well as weaknesses that call for a synthetic approach.
