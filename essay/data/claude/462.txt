China is emerging as the world's next superpower, poised to overtake the United States as the world's largest economy. While China still has hundreds of millions of people living in poverty, its rapid economic growth over the past few decades has lifted hundreds of millions of others into a new global middle class. China's economic might and influence is deeply shaping global capitalism and empowering non-state actors in numerous ways.

At the most basic level, China's 1.4 billion consumers represent a massive market, one that multinational corporations and brands are increasingly tapping. China is a top export market and production base for companies from around the world, from Apple and General Motors to Starbucks and Nike. As China's middle class grows, demand for luxury goods, technology, automobiles, and experiences is fueling revenue growth for many major global companies. China's consumers are also becoming more sophisticated and discerning, forcing companies to adapt their products, services and marketing to local tastes and preferences. Non-state actors, especially corporations, must now cater to Chinese interests and sensibilities to access this lucrative market. 

Beyond being a giant market, China is also a production powerhouse. Its low labor costs, lax regulations, massive scale, and government subsidies have made China a manufacturing hub for countless industries. According to some estimates, one-third of global manufacturing now happens in China. Supply chains that stretch across the world converge in China, where raw materials and components are assembled into finished goods to be shipped around the globe. This has reduced production costs for companies and consumers worldwide but also made the global economy heavily dependent on China. It has empowered China's factory owners and manufacturers as key non-state actors.

China is also increasingly outward-facing in its investments and acquisitions abroad. Its giant sovereign wealth fund and large state-owned enterprises are buying up assets across the world, from ports in Greece to farms in Australia. They are also investing in and acquiring major technology and consumer brands, giving China more control over the means of global production and soft power. This rise in mergers and acquisitions also gives China's companies more clout on the global stage as significant multinational actors in their own right.   

At the same time, China is asserting itself through major trade and development deals that span continents, from the Belt and Road Initiative spanning Asia, Africa and Europe to free trade deals in Central America and the Pacific. These initiatives strengthen China's strategic interests, give its state-owned companies opportunities in new markets, and enhance China's status as a global economic leader. They also reshape global trade routes and relationships in China's favor while empowering new non-state partners in participating nations.   

In conclusion, China's significance in global capitalism and for non-state actors is multi-dimensional. It is a consumer superpower, a manufacturing hub, an investment powerhouse, and a strategic trade partner offering both opportunity and risks. China's economy and companies are deeply integrated into global supply chains, partnerships and transactions. However, China also seeks to gain more control over and benefit from the global system. Although China is still classified as a developing country, its role as a global economic heavyweight is quickly elevating its importance for global capitalism and empowering new non-state actors within and far beyond its borders. Overall, China's rise signals a shift in global power that will reshape both economic and geopolitical realities in the 21st century.
