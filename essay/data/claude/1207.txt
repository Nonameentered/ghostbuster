Oximeters are devices that use infrared light to monitor a patient's oxygen saturation levels as well as pulse rate. They are useful tools within a medical environment for continuous monitoring and assessing a patient's respiratory status. However, there are both advantages and limitations to using oximeters.

The main advantage of oximeters is that they provide real-time, non-invasive monitoring of a patient's oxygen levels and pulse rate. This allows medical staff to quickly detect any changes or drops in oxygen saturation that may require medical intervention. Oximeters are also very portable, allowing for both spot-checking and continuous monitoring as patients move around the medical facility. They are easy to use with minimal training required to obtain readings and do not require calibration like some other medical devices.

However, there are some limitations to oximeter use. They are susceptible to errors from motion artifacts, excessive vibrations, and changes in light levels which can produce inaccurate readings. Certain patient conditions like anemia, hypothermia, and hypotension can also affect the accuracy of oximeter readings. The placement of the oximeter probe is critical to obtaining an accurate reading, and incorrect placement on the finger or earlobe may produce lower oxygen saturation readings. Environmental factors like bright overhead lighting can interfere with the infrared light used by the oximeter, requiring shielding or repositioning of the patient. 

In investigating the differences between resting and active pulse rates using an oximeter, several factors were observed to affect the readings. During exercise, the increase in circulation and oxygen demand caused an increase in heart rate and pulse rate detected by the oximeter. However, excessive movement of the hand and finger probe during exercise could produce errors in the recordings, with pulse rates sometimes lagging or fluctuating from the actual value. Ensuring the oximeter probe remains securely in place helps to combat motion artifacts for more accurate readings during activity and exercise.

To ensure the most accurate readings, oximeters should be used in conjunction with an ECG machine that also monitors a patient's heart rate and rhythm. Any concerning drops or rises in oxygen levels or major discrepancies between the oximeter and ECG readings would require further evaluation by medical professionals to determine the cause of the change. Used together, oximeters and ECG provide the most comprehensive monitoring of a patient's respiratory and heart status, alerting staff to any potential complications as soon as changes start to occur.

In summary, oximeters offer a simple yet effective tool for monitoring patients in a medical setting but also have some limitations in their use. When used properly in conjunction with other monitoring equipment like ECG machines, oximeters can provide the necessary data to help ensure patients remain in stable condition during their care.
