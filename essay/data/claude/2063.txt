Here is a draft 482 word essay in response to the prompt:

External product attributes such as price, brand, store name, and country of product origin are important to consumers from various socio-economic backgrounds when shopping at Marks and Spencer (M&S). However, the degree of importance placed on these attributes is likely to vary based on a consumer's socio-economic status. 

Consumers from higher socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to place greater importance on brand and store name. M&S is seen as an upmarket and luxurious brand that caters to middle and upper-class consumers in the UK.  Affluent consumers tend to be very brand-conscious and see premium brands as a symbol of their social status. They are willing to pay higher prices to purchase branded products from premium stores like M&S.

In contrast, consumers from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more price-sensitive and may see M&S as too expensive. They will likely place greater importance on lower prices and finding good value. While brand and store name may still be relevant, affordability and budget will be much bigger considerations for them when shopping at M&S. They may only purchase items on sale or discount to make them more affordable.

The country of origin effect suggests that consumers perceive products from certain countries as being higher or lower quality. At M&S, products made in the UK or other Western countries may appeal more to affluent British consumers who associate them with good quality and craftsmanship. Price-sensitive shoppers may be indifferent or prefer lower-priced imported goods.

The methodology used in the study and sampling strategy can significantly impact the results obtained. Using surveys to gather self-reported data from consumers has limitations as respondents may not always provide fully honest answers. The sampling strategy also needs to ensure that a representative sample of consumers from different socio-economic backgrounds is included, otherwise the results may be skewed.

In summary, while external product attributes are important to all M&S shoppers, consumers of different socio-economic status place varying degrees of importance on factors like brand, price, country of origin and quality based on their budgets and preferences. The methodology and sampling approach must be carefully designed to account for these differences and obtain accurate insights into consumer behavior.
