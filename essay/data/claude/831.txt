Falls are a common and serious problem among the elderly population. There are several reasons why older adults are more prone to falls. A major cause is changes in their cardiovascular system that come with age. 

As people get older, their blood vessels become less elastic, blood flow is reduced, and blood pressure rises. These cardiovascular changes can lead to conditions like orthostatic hypotension, where blood pressure drops upon standing up, causing dizziness and fainting. If an older person stands up too quickly, the reduced blood flow to the brain can cause a brief loss of consciousness and lead to a fall. Slower movements and cautiously changing positions can help prevent these types of falls.

Other cardiovascular issues like abnormal heart rhythms or heart attacks can also increase the risk of falls in the elderly. During an irregular heartbeat or heart attack, less oxygenated blood reaches the brain which can causes dizziness or fainting. For those with known heart conditions, symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations should be monitored and reported to a doctor right away. Care should be taken when walking or moving to avoid falls during these episodes.

There are several other common reasons for falls including muscle weakness from aging or conditions like stroke. Reduced mobility and balance problems also contribute. Medications can sometimes cause side effects like dizziness or drowsiness leading to falls. Eliminating tripping hazards in the home, installing grab bars and using mobility aids like canes or walkers can help prevent falls for many elderly people.

For stroke patients, close monitoring of fluid and diet is important to avoid potential falls from malnutrition or dehydration. Stroke can impact swallowing ability, increasing the risk of choking which could lead to falls. A soft diet, thickened liquids or tube feeding may be required in some cases to ensure proper nutrition and hydration while safeguarding against falls or aspiration. 

In summary, the high incidence of falls in the elderly can often be attributed to age-related declines in the cardiovascular system and other issues like stroke. By managing heart conditions, controlling medications, improving home safety and ensuring proper nutrition, many falls can be prevented allowing older adults to maintain independence and quality of life.
