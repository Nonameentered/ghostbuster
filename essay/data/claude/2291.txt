Thucydides, the ancient Greek historian, vividly described and analyzed the Great Plague of Athens in 430 BCE in his work History of the Peloponnesian War. The plague caused immense deaths and social disruption in Athens, claiming lives of one-third of the Athenian population. Thucydides, himself a survivor of the plague, attempted to identify the causes and cures of the plague by examining its symptoms, spread, mortality rates, and medical responses. In many ways, his analysis aligned with the contemporary medical theories of the Hippocratics, who saw disease as stemming from an imbalance of humors in the body and environment.

Thucydides first noted how overcrowding and poor hygiene in Athens enabled the spread of the plague. The Athenians had retreated within the city walls to avoid the Spartan armies, leading to cramped and unsanitary conditions. The lack of open space and “the crowding of men upon one another in huts or in narrow streets” made it easy for the “pestilence” to spread through direct physical contact and contaminated air. This reflected the Hippocratic miasmatic theory that “pestilential diseases” arose from foul-smelling air and proximity to the sick.

The symptoms Thucydides described also matched the Hippocratic notion of imbalance in the four humors: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. The plague began with a “strong fever of heat in the head,” indicating an excess of yellow bile which the Hippocratics linked to overactive “innate heat.” This was accompanied by coughs and sneezes as the innate heat transferred to phlegm, followed by nausea, vomiting of bile, and stomach pains showing disequilibrium among all four humors. Extreme heat gave way to “external coldness,” reflecting depletion and imbalance.

Thucydides noted the high mortality of the plague, especially among physicians and caregivers. The plague “seized” individuals suddenly and ended quickly in death after about seven to nine days, indicating extreme humor imbalance the body could not rectify. The Hippocratics believed most diseases could be cured by readjusting humors through purging, bleeding, diets, and medications to restore equilibrium, but a complete imbalance of humors would lead to death. 

Finally, Thucydides described the medical responses to the plague. At first physicians could not identify a “salutary plan of treatment” and even bled and purged patients, worsening their condition. Once the epidemic reached its height, the Athenians gave up and “abandoned all attempts to cure and succor the sick.” Only later did they develop “regimen and administer[] simple remedies.” This trial-and-error process accorded with the Hippocratic approach of adapting treatments based on careful observation and the specifics of each patient and disease.

In conclusion, Thucydides' account of the Athenian plague provides a glimpse into ancient Greek medical theories and practices. His description of the spread, symptoms, and mortality of the plague aligned closely with the Hippocratic notion of humoral imbalance and balance as the origin of disease and the path to health. At the same time, the immense spread and death toll of the plague demonstrated the limits of Greek medical knowledge at the time, which struggled in the face of new contagions and epidemics unseen before. Overall, Thucydides' history stands as a lasting testimony to  the medical spirit of inquiry in 5th century Greece.
