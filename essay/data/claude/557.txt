The decades leading up to the Great Reform Act of 1832 in Britain saw immense changes in the nation's political system, including the emergence of organized political parties. While the Tory party is often said to have existed as a cohesive political party during this era, there is much debate about the extent to which this was truly the case. Overall, there were significant barriers to the development of an organized and unified Tory party.  

One of the main factors preventing the coalescence of a Tory party was the leadership of William Pitt the Younger, who served as Prime Minister for much of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Pitt was opposed to the development of party-based politics and instead envisioned a system of independent MPs putting national interest above faction. As such, Pitt appointed ministers and awarded patronage largely based on merit rather than political allegiance. This hindered the growth of strong party institutions and loyalty.

However, some nascent signs of an emerging Tory party were present. Many MPs still held strong Tory ideological beliefs, supporting the monarchy, the Church of England, and traditional social hierarchies. These shared beliefs and values provided a loose cohesion for Tory MPs. In addition, the Tories were often united in opposing the policies and ideologies of the emerging Whig party. Nevertheless, divisions remained within the Tories over some key issues like Catholic emancipation.

While Tory MPs were often loyal to the government and would rally behind leaders like Pitt, this loyalty was based more on pragmatism and shared opposition to the Whigs rather than strong party allegiance. When Pitt left office, the Tories fractured into rival factions that competed for power and influence. Only after Pitt's death did stronger party institutions start to develop under leaders like Lord Liverpool.

In conclusion, while the Tories were united by some ideological threads and a shared opposition to the Whigs, there were substantial barriers to the development of a true, cohesive political party before the 1832 Reform Act. Pitt's leadership and opposition to party politics, the lack of strong party institutions, and internal divisions prevented the emergence of an organized Tory party. The Tories would not become a unified party machine for another few decades. Overall, the extent to which there was a Tory party during this era is debatable.
