Here is an essay of about 1250 words on the differences between the Lyon Tablet inscription and Tacitus' version of Claudius' speech to the Senate regarding the admission of Gallic nobles into the Senate:

The Lyon Tablet inscription and Tacitus' version of Claudius' speech on admitting Gauls to the Senate differ in key ways that impact the portrayal of Claudius and the persuasive effect of the speech. The Lyon Tablet, carved in stone around 48 AD to commemorate Claudius' speech, provides a abbreviated summary of Claudius' arguments. In contrast, Tacitus, writing his Annals around 116 AD, provides a longer, more rhetorically elaborate version meant to characterize Claudius and make a broader point about the negative impacts of imperial expansion. 

The Lyon Tablet focuses narrowly on Claudius' key arguments for admitting Gauls to the Senate. It emphasizes that the Gauls are now peaceful and loyal Roman allies after their conquest by Julius Caesar, that their admission would reward and honor loyal allies, and that it would spread Roman culture. The Tablet portrays Claudius' position as reasonable and his arguments as straightforward. In contrast, Tacitus' version is twice as long and crafts the speech as a rhetorical set-piece to characterize Claudius as pompous and unintelligent. Tacitus has Claudius make long digressions, repeat himself, and make overly elaborate arguments, portraying the speech as disorganized and Claudius as nonsensical.

The differences also impact how persuasive and compelling Claudius' arguments seem. The Lyon Tablet presents concise, compelling arguments that would likely persuade a reasonable listener. Tacitus, however, shapes the speech to make Claudius' arguments seem misguided and foolish through their poor and lengthy articulation. Tacitus wants the speech to reflect poorly on Claudius rather than be genuinely persuasive.

Finally, the sources differ in how they frame the broader significance of admitting Gauls to the Senate. The Lyon Tablet simply commemorates this policy success to honor Claudius. Tacitus, however, argues that the admission of once-hostile foreigners to help rule the empire marked a dangerous expansion of citizenship that weakened Rome. Thus, he crafts Claudius' speech to make his policy position seem absurd to support Tacitus' own view about the negative consequences of imperial expansion.

In conclusion, the Lyon Tablet and Tacitus' speech differ substantially in their depiction of Claudius, persuasive effect, and framing of the issues. They provide very different interpretations of the same historical episode to suit their authors' distinct purposes. The Lyon Tablet honors Claudius' accomplishment while Tacitus uses it as a chance to characterize and discredit Claudius in support of Tacitus' own historiographical arguments.
