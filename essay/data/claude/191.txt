Here is a draft 750-word essay in response to the prompt:

Acute severe asthma attacks are medical emergencies that require rapid diagnosis and appropriate treatment to prevent respiratory failure and even death. Assessing the severity of an asthma attack is critical to determining the appropriate diagnosis and course of treatment. Factors such as wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and oxygen saturation levels should be evaluated to classify the attack as mild, moderate or severe.  In severe asthma attacks, patients often present with symptoms like extreme difficulty breathing, cyanosis, and mental status changes. These life-threatening attacks require immediate treatment with oxygen, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids.   

Differential diagnoses are also important to consider, as conditions like vocal cord dysfunction, cardiac disease, and pneumonia can present similarly to asthma attacks. An accurate patient history and physical exam, as well as tests like chest x-rays, electrocardiograms and lung function tests may be needed to rule out other possible diagnoses. Appropriate treatment cannot be determined without an correct diagnosis. For severe asthma attacks, treatment must be aggressive and initiated as soon as possible. Bronchodilators are typically given to open airways, corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation, and intravenous fluids or magnesium sulfate may be administered for dehydration or electrolyte imbalance. If symptoms do not improve with initial treatments or oxygen levels remain low, intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required.

Beyond the acute management of severe asthma attacks, long-term control and patient education are essential to prevent future exacerbations and hospitalizations. Long-term control medications, especially inhaled corticosteroids, are critical for keeping chronic asthma well-controlled. However, many asthmatics continue to struggle due to a lack of understanding about proper medication use and triggers, poverty, psychosocial factors and healthcare access issues. Specialized asthma education programs have been shown to help address these barriers and improve outcomes. 

In summary, rapid diagnosis and treatment of acute severe asthma attacks is vital to prevent respiratory failure and death. Assessing severity, determining an accurate diagnosis and initiating treatments like oxygen, bronchodilators and corticosteroids as early as possible provide the best outcomes. Patient education also plays an important role in keeping chronic asthma well-controlled and preventing attacks, though many barriers must be addressed through focused education and healthcare initiatives. Overall, optimal management of asthma requires a comprehensive, multifaceted approach centered on the individual patient.
