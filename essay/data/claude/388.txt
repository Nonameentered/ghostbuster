The problem-based learning (PBL) approach was first introduced in medical education in the mid-1960s at McMaster University in Canada. It was a radical shift from the traditional discipline-based model of medical education that prevailed at the time. Several factors led to the development of PBL as an alternative approach.

First, the traditional medical curriculum was overcrowded, with students memorizing huge amounts of facts and receiving little clinical experience. Students were struggling under the volume of content, and critics argued much of it was irrelevant to medical practice. There were calls to re-think medical education to focus on themes and concepts rather than endless memorization. PBL provided a mechanism to cut down on excess content and refocus learning on key principles.

Second, medical knowledge was expanding rapidly. Critics argued the traditional curriculum could not keep up with the pace of change and new discoveries in medicine. Students needed to develop self-directed learning skills to stay current with medical advances over their careers. PBL's emphasis on independent inquiry and learning skills was designed to equip students for lifelong self-directed learning.  

Third, the traditional curriculum had an imbalance of classroom learning versus clinical experience. Students went through years of classroom study before encountering patients in clinical rotations. PBL incorporated clinical problems into the early curriculum, exposing students to patient scenarios from the beginning of their studies to provide context for their learning. This helped motivate students and demonstrate the relevance of their studies to medical practice.

Finally, medical educators wanted to move beyond a narrow biomedical focus to train more well-rounded physicians. The traditional curriculum emphasized scientific knowledge over communication, collaboration, and other professional skills. PBL's group-based problem-solving approach provided opportunities for students to develop skills such as collaborative learning, communication, critical thinking, and problem-solvingâ€”tools as essential as scientific knowledge for practicing medicine.

In summary, the traditional medical curriculum was in need of reform by the 1960s due to its excessive content, lack of relevance and context, limited opportunity to develop key skills, and narrow scientific focus. PBL was developed as an alternative model that could provide a broad-based, relevant education to prepare students for the demands of medical practice. It emphasized self-directed learning, integrated knowledge and skills, group collaboration, and exposure to clinical contexts from the early stages of medical education. PBL challenged the status quo of medical education and offered an innovative solution to the limitations of traditional curricula at the time. Overall, PBL aimed to produce more well-rounded, competent physicians ready to tackle the complexities of medical practice.
