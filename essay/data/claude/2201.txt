The antioxidant potential of a range of samples can be assessed using three common procedures: the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay, the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay, and the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay.  

For the DPPH assay, stock solutions of the samples are prepared in methanol and diluted to different concentrations. The DPPH reagent is also prepared in methanol. 150 μl of the sample solutions are mixed with 2850 μl of the DPPH reagent. After 30 minutes, the absorbance is measured at 517 nm using a spectrophotometer. The DPPH radical scavenging activity is calculated based on the control. This is repeated in triplicate for each sample to determine repeatability.

In the FRAP assay, the working FRAP reagent is prepared fresh by mixing acetate buffer, TPTZ solution, and FeCl3*6H2O solution in a 10:1:1 ratio respectively. 150 μl of the sample solutions are added to 2850 μl of the FRAP reagent. After 4 minutes, the absorbance is measured at 593 nm. The FRAP value is calculated based on a FeSO4 standard curve. This is also repeated in triplicate for repeatability.  

For the ORAC assay, fluorescein solution and AAPH radical solution are prepared. 150 μl of sample, blank or standard solutions are mixed with 25 μl of fluorescein and 3 ml of AAPH solution. The fluorescence is measured every 2 minutes for 2 hours at 37°C. The area under the curve (AUC) is calculated and the results are expressed as micromoles of Trolox equivalents (TE) per gram of sample based on a Trolox standard curve. Triplicate results are obtained for repeatability. 

In summary, the prepared sample solutions are tested against different reactive reagents in each assay.  Absorbance or fluorescence is measured as an indicator of radical scavenging or reducing capacity. Repeat testing under same conditions ensures repeatability and reproducibility of the measurements. The averaged triplicate results for each sample enable comparison of antioxidant potentials.
