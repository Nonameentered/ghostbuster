The law of tort is a complex yet constantly evolving area of law that covers civil wrongs and injuries caused by one party to another. At the core of tort law are the concepts of negligence and duty of care – the notions that individuals have an obligation to act responsibly towards others in society and take reasonable care not to cause harm. When negligence and a duty of care are established in a tort case, the defendant can be found liable and ordered to pay damages to the plaintiff.

The foundation of negligence was first articulated in the 19th century legal case of Donoghue v Stevenson, where Lord Atkin established that a duty of care exists between parties who could reasonably foresee harm as a result of their actions or products. Since then, the law of negligence has evolved to account for new scenarios and relationships, such as the latter 20th century recognition of an employer's duty of care towards employees in workplace injuries. However, the degree of duty continues to vary depending on the relationship between parties, with a higher duty of care owed in situations between public transportation companies and passengers, for example, versus between two unrelated business owners.

A plaintiff in a negligence case must prove four elements in order to establish liability – that the defendant owed them a duty of care; the defendant breached this duty through an act of negligence; the plaintiff suffered actual loss or damage; and the breach in duty caused the loss or damage. Over the 20th century, courts grappled with cases that debated what constitutes negligence and a breach in duty of care – issues such as improper building construction, medical malpractice, and psychical harm from negligence. In these cases, precedents have been set regarding the degree of skill, expertise, and foresight expected of players such as builders, doctors, employers, and property owners. 

In conclusion, the law of negligence and duty of care has evolved in fits and starts through the precedents set in landmark tort cases. While its origins lie in basic notions of responsibility between individuals and reasonable foreseeability of harm, it has adapted to accommodate new relationships and complex scenarios brought about by industrialization and technological progress. The obligations and duties imposed on parties vary greatly depending on the nature of the relationship, but require that they take reasonable care to prevent unnecessary harm. Negligence and duty of care remain highly complex yet central concepts in tort law.
