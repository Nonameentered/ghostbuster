Here is a 1500 word essay in response to the prompt:

The Maillard reaction is a chemical reaction between amino acids and reducing sugars that occurs when foods are cooked at high temperatures. It is responsible for the brown color and flavor of foods like toasted bread, grilled meats, and baked goods. While it results in desirable flavors and aromas, the Maillard reaction also produces advanced glycation end products (AGEs) which are harmful compounds that can accumulate in the body. 

There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder in which the body produces insulin but cells do not respond to it properly, known as insulin resistance. In both types of diabetes, insulin is either not produced or not utilized effectively, leading to hyperglycemia or high blood sugar levels.

Type 1 diabetes is treated with insulin injections or an insulin pump to replace what the body cannot produce. Type 2 diabetes is often managed first through lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, but may also require oral medications or insulin if those are not sufficient. The goal of treatment for both types of diabetes is to keep blood glucose levels within a normal range to minimize complications.

Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to both microvascular and macrovascular complications. Microvascular complications include damage to small blood vessels in the eyes, nerves, and kidneys. This can lead to diabetic retinopathy which causes vision loss, diabetic neuropathy which causes nerve damage, and diabetic nephropathy which causes kidney damage. Macrovascular complications include cardiovascular disease like heart attack and stroke. High blood sugar damages blood vessels and promotes atherosclerosis which leads to these complications.

AGEs form through a process known as glycation where excess glucose in the blood binds to proteins. As blood sugar levels remain high, more and more glucose attaches to proteins and these AGEs accumulate. AGEs alter the structure and function of proteins and contribute to aging and disease. They can build up on cellular proteins, extracellular matrix proteins like collagen, and circulating proteins like hemoglobin. The formation and accumulation of AGEs leads to stiffening of blood vessels and tissues, as well as inflammation in the body which exacerbates diabetes complications. 

In summary, the Maillard reaction and formation of AGEs relate to diabetes through the consequences of hyperglycemia. The two main types of diabetes involve lack of insulin production or insulin resistance, both of which lead to high blood sugar. Diabetes complications arise from damage to blood vessels and nerves, often caused or worsened by AGE accumulation in the body. Treatment focuses on controlling blood glucose to minimize these harmful effects.
