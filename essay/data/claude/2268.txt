Steel and aluminum alloys exhibit different mechanical properties when subjected to heat treatment processes like quenching, tempering and aging. Quenching is the rapid cooling of a metal to obtain certain mechanical properties like hardness. When steel is quenched from a high temperature, its hardness increases due to the formation of martensite, while its ductility and toughness decrease. Tempering subsequently heats the steel to a lower temperature to restore some ductility and toughness. 

The purpose of tempering steel is to achieve an optimal balance of hardness, ductility and toughness for a given application. For example, a steel gear may be quenched to maximize hardness, then tempered slightly to improve toughness so it does not break in use. The precise tempering temperature depends on the desired properties - higher tempering temperatures decrease hardness but increase ductility and toughness.

Aluminum alloys can be strengthened using precipitation hardening by aging the alloy at room or elevated temperatures to allow the formation of fine precipitates. This hardens the alloy by interfering with dislocation movement. Precipitation hardened aluminum alloys may exhibit higher strengths than alloys that only age harden at room temperature. For example, aluminum alloy 7075 achieves significantly higher strength when artificially aged compared to as-cast or naturally aged properties.

In summary, quenching and tempering steel, and precipitation hardening aluminum alloys are effective ways to tailor the mechanical properties of these materials for specific applications by controlling the microstructures formed. The resulting balance of hardness, ductility and toughness in each material depends on properly selecting heat treatment parameters for the desired properties.
