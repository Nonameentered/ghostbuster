The ongoing debate between particularism and generalism relates to whether morality should be governed by universal principles that apply regardless of context or if moral decision making should be sensitive to the particular details of a situation. Particularists argue that moral reasoning must consider the specifics of the situation at hand, while generalists argue that there are certain universal moral rules that should be applied irrespective of context.

One argument frequently made in defense of particularism is that it allows for more nuanced moral judgments by recognizing the complexity and uniqueness of each situation. Particularists argue that moral actions depend profoundly on circumstance and that there are too many conditions that factor into a moral decision to be captured by general rules. For example, notions of harm, consent, and fairness may take on different meanings in different contexts. If we focus too rigidly on rules, we may miss morally relevant details or make poor moral judgments. Particularists argue that sensitivity to context is required for moral expertise and virtuous action.

While particularism has some appeal, generalism also has a number of arguments in its favor. One argument for generalism is that it provides clearer guidance for moral reasoning and decision making. Universal moral rules can give agents more specific direction about what they should do in a situation, promoting consistency in judgments. Particularism may seem too open-ended or subjective without any guiding principles. Generalism also argues that certain fundamental moral duties—such as prohibitions against murder, cruelty, and deception—should apply across all contexts. If morality was wholly dependent on circumstance, it could be used to justify nearly any behavior in some situation. So, generalism promotes a stable moral framework.

A common objection to generalism is that it can lead to dogmatism or an unwillingness to make exceptions. Strict adherence to rules can prevent recognizing extenuating circumstances where rules should not apply. Generalists counter that rules can still allow for flexibility and their guidance is needed only in normal circumstances. They argue rules should be applied with some discretion and nuance. A main objection to particularism is that it provides little practical guidance for moral reasoning or how we determine which features of a context are morally salient. Particularism needs to give agents more direction on how to analyze moral situations if it wants to be action-guiding.

In my assessment, there are good reasons to adopt elements of both particularism and generalism. An approach that balances universal moral principles with sensitivity to context is most promising. Moral rules establish a moral framework and guidance, while judgment enables recognizing exceptions to rules and nuanced analysis of complex cases. Neither a strictly universalist nor relativistic view alone provides a fully satisfying moral theory. The conflict between particularism and generalism should be reconciled through incorporating insights from both views, rather than adopting either stance in its extreme form. Overall, this essay outlines some of the main arguments that have been presented regarding the tension between particularism and generalism and provides a critical evaluation of these positions, arguing for incorporating aspects of both views.
