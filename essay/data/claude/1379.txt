Corporate social responsibility (CSR) refers to a company's sense of responsibility towards the community and environment in which it operates. Companies are increasingly integrating CSR into their business practices, adopting more sustainable and ethical practices and policies. However, implementing CSR effectively in practice faces many challenges and limitations.

There are several reasons why companies adopt CSR practices. First, CSR helps to strengthen relationships with key stakeholders like customers, employees, and investors. Socially responsible practices can boost brand image and customer loyalty. Employees also tend to be more engaged and productive when working for socially responsible companies. Investors are showing more interest in companies with good CSR and sustainability performance. 

Second, CSR leads to cost savings and efficiencies. Reducing waste and pollution improves resource efficiency and cuts costs. Improving worker conditions like healthcare and education enhances productivity. Developing greener products and services opens up new market opportunities.

However, implementing CSR is difficult in practice. There is no universal standard for CSR, so companies struggle with identifying and prioritizing the most relevant social and environmental issues to address. They have to consider trade-offs between responsibilities to different stakeholder groups. Assessing and measuring the impact of CSR initiatives also pose challenges given the qualitative nature of many social and environmental outcomes.

Enforcement of CSR is also problematic. Most CSR efforts remain voluntary, relying on companies' goodwill. Though many view regulation as necessary to curb irresponsible practices, legislation can be complex to design and implement. There is also debate around whether and how companies can be held legally liable for the social and environmental consequences of their actions.

In conclusion, while CSR adoption is growing, there are reasonable doubts about its effectiveness and workability in practice. Given the lack of standards and limited enforcement, CSR risks being more rhetoric than reality. However, companies are making genuine efforts to integrate CSR, spurred on by clear business benefits and pressure to operate sustainably and ethically. Overall, CSR can work in practice, but its effectiveness depends on consistent commitment and collaboration across all stakeholders to develop shared standards and accountability. More research is also needed to address gaps in understanding around how to maximize the business and societal value created by CSR.
