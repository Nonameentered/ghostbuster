Susan Okin's arguments regarding justice within the family unit directly challenge the public/private distinction that John Rawls adopts in his theory of justice as fairness. In her essay "Justice, Gender, and the Family," Okin argues that "the family is not a separate sphere of justice, but an integral part of the basic structure of society" and the principles of justice should apply as much within the family as in the public sphere. For Okin, Rawls' relegation of family life to the private realm leaves open the possibility of injustice within familiesâ€”especially against women and children. 

Rawls believes that the principles of justice as fairness apply primarily to the basic structure of society, which he defines as society's main political, social, and economic institutions. For Rawls, the family is part of the private sphere of life and not subject to principles of justice in the same way. He argues that "there is no more reason to suppose that the standards of justice should apply to the internal life of the family than to all the other private associations individuals enter into in daily life." Rawls believes that justice requires equality of opportunity and fairness in the distribution of what he calls "primary goods" (rights, liberties, powers, opportunities, income, wealth, etc.) in the public sphere. Within the family, however, individuals can make their own judgments about the distribution of resources and responsibilities according to their own values and interests.

Okin argues against the strict public/private distinction that Rawls adopts. She contends that the family is not merely a private association, but rather an integral part of society's basic structure. Families are shaped by social norms and laws, rely upon societal institutions, and shape individuals in fundamental ways. As such, Okin argues, the principles of justice should apply within families. Specifically, justice requires that gender equality and fairness be present in the internal dynamics of the family unit. If they are not, the overall basic structure of society cannot be just, even if the public sphere meets principles of justice. Okin sees the family as a "crucial training ground" for justice and believes justice within families is necessary to achieve justice throughout society.

Rawls does not seem to disagree with Okin's arguments in principle. However, his view that the family belongs to the private sphere leads him to believe that direct application of principles of justice may be inappropriate and an infringement upon personal liberty within families. For Rawls, justice requires that people have maximum equal liberty to organize their own associations and personal relationships as they see fit. Okin argues, though, that viewing the family as merely a private association overlooks the integral role it plays in the basic structure of society and the harms that can result from inequality within families. There is tension here between recognizing the private liberty of individuals within families and promoting justice for all members of families. 

In conclusion, while Okin and Rawls both aim to articulate principles of justice and fairness, there is an important distinction in how they think about the family and its relationship to justice. Rawls's theory delimitates a private sphere of life to which principles of justice do not directly apply, while Okin argues against a strict public/private dichotomy and believes the family should not be exempt from justice. Their dialogue highlights tensions around balancing personal liberty and equality within the institution of the family that remain relevant today.
