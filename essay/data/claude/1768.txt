Simon Armitage's '[I am bothered when I think]' and John Wilmot's 'Upon his Leaving his Mistress' both explore the themes of love and marriage, though the poems differ greatly in their structure, style and use of figurative language to convey very different perspectives on relationships and the institution of marriage. 

Armitage's poem adopts a contemplative, regretful tone as the speaker reflects on his marriage and the loss of passion and independence. The poem is composed of four stanzas of uneven length, suggesting the restless and troubled nature of the speaker's thoughts. The irregular line breaks also reflect the speaker's unsettled state of mind as his thoughts flow in a non-linear, fragmented fashion. The colloquial style and simple language - 'it's not too much to ask for a little passion' - gives the poem an intimate, confessional quality as the speaker opens up about his innermost feelings and reflections on his relationship.

In contrast, Wilmot's poem adopts a cynical and scornful tone in rejecting the notion of marriage and monogamy. The poem follows a regular rhyme scheme and metre, giving it a light, comical feel which belies the poem's scathing criticism of societal conventions and female coquettishness. Wilmot frequently employs hyperbole for comedic effect, evident in lines such as 'My very rivals wish me in your chains' and 'And lovers yet unborn shall bless this night'. The exaggerated and melodramatic metaphors across the poem serve to mock the idea of courtly love and eternal fidelity between lovers.

Both poems employ the extended metaphor of imprisonment to represent the loss of freedom in marriage and monogamy. In Armitage's poem, the speaker laments that  'we've made our bed, and now we're shaped by it', conveying how he feels trapped in the mundane routine of married life. Similarly, Wilmot refers to 'your charms, by which I was first betrayed...into this cage', highlighting how marriage ensnares lovers. However, while Armitage adopts a sincere and reflective tone, Wilmot employs hyperbolic metaphor and irony to parody and deride the notion of marriage as a 'cage'.

In conclusion, while Armitage's '[I am bothered when I think]' and Wilmot's 'Upon his Leaving his Mistress' both explore themes of lost freedom and passion within the institution of marriage, the poems offer opposing views through differences in form, style and metaphorical language. Armitage adopts an intimate confessional tone to convey honest reflections on relationship struggles, whereas Wilmot employs irony and hyperbole to scornfully reject societal conventions of courtship and wedlock. Though written centuries apart, the timeless themes of love and marriage remain, even as perspectives on relationships change.
