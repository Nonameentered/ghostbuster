Here is a draft 1000 word essay in response to the prompt:

Should Germany introduce a smoking ban for all enclosed public places, including pubs and nightclubs? There are reasonable arguments on both sides of this issue. Some reject a ban on the grounds of personal freedom and the potential economic impact on businesses like pubs and nightclubs. However, there are compelling reasons why Germany should join other nations in instituting a comprehensive indoor smoking ban, including protecting public health, especially for young people and non-smokers, and the likely economic benefits.

Those against a smoking ban argue that it infringes on personal freedom and choice. Smokers claim they have the right to smoke where and when they want, as long as they do not harm others. While some see smoking as unpleasant, smokers view it as an enjoyable activity they should be free to engage in. There are also concerns that a ban could reduce revenue for pubs, bars, and nightclubs as some smokers may stay home or go out less.

However, these arguments against an indoor smoking ban are problematic and outweighed by the benefits. First, smoking does inflict harm on others through secondhand smoke, which contains toxic and carcinogenic chemicals. Non-smokers, especially children and pregnant women, deserve protection from these health hazards in public places. A ban protects people who work in bars and clubs, who face constant exposure to secondhand smoke. 

Second, contrary to claims that business will decline, studies show that revenues remain stable or even increase in places that ban smoking. Non-smokers may actually frequent establishments more often. Banning smoking also reduces costs from damage, cleaning, and high insurance premiums. Some smokers continue to go out, while others may quit or cut back. Overall, the economy is largely unaffected.

Finally, an indoor smoking ban models healthy behavior and attitudes to young people. It helps prevent children and teenagers from smoking by reducing opportunities and making smoking less visible and normative. This could have substantial long term public health benefits.

In conclusion, while an indoor smoking ban may be seen by some as an infringement on personal freedom, the benefits to public health, especially for non-smokers and young people, and the likelihood of economic benefits, make a compelling case for Germany to join other nations in instituting a comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places, including pubs and nightclubs. Protecting citizens from harmful secondhand smoke should be a higher priority than personal freedom to smoke when and where one wants. With the right implementation, an indoor smoking ban could have a major positive impact on health and society in Germany.
