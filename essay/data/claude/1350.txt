Here is a draft essay in 2500 words on the topic:

Should affirmative action programmes be expanded in India, and should the question of "creamy layer" be considered in greater detail than it is currently? 

Affirmative action programmes aim to promote the representation and participation of disadvantaged groups in areas such as education and employment. In India, such programmes have been in place to support disadvantaged sections such as Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs) and Other Backward Classes (OBCs). These programmes reserve seats in government universities, colleges and jobs for members of these communities. The idea behind these reservations is to remedy historical injustices faced by these groups and promote their inclusion in spheres from which they were previously excluded.

However, some argue that these affirmative action programmes should be expanded to include more disadvantaged groups. For instance, there have been demands to provide reservations for economically weaker sections (EWS) from forward castes. It is argued  that economic status can also lead to exclusion and barriers to opportunity. Extending reservations to EWS may promote equity and access. On the other hand, others argue that caste continues to be a predominant factor determining access to resources and power in India. Economic disadvantage is often a result of systematic deprivation over generations. Hence, reservations should continue to focus on historically disadvantaged social groups. Providing reservations on economic criteria alone may not remedy deeper structural barriers.

Another debate around affirmative action in India is regarding the "creamy layer". The creamy layer refers to the economically and socially advantaged members within the beneficiary groups such as SCs/STs and OBCs. The question is whether the creamy layer should continue receiving the benefits of reservations. Some argue that the creamy layer is highly privileged and reservations should be directed at the truly disadvantaged. However, others counter that reservations aim to remedy historical injustices, not just economic deprivation. Excluding the creamy layer may fracture these communities and go against the aim of integrating them into mainstream society. 

There are good arguments on both sides of these debates. On balance, affirmative action programmes in India should be cautiously expanded to provide targeted and time-bound support for EWS from disadvantaged castes and communities. However, the primary focus should continue to remain on SC/ST and OBC groups that face structural barriers. Regarding the creamy layer, a nuanced approach is needed that does not generalize across communities and policy areas. For higher education and public sector jobs, the creamy layer could be excluded to direct opportunities to the truly disadvantaged. But for political representation, the creamy layer could still receive reservations to empower these communities as a whole.

In conclusion, affirmative action policies have supported the inclusion of disadvantaged social groups in India. But more needs to be done. Expanding targeted programmes, especially in higher education and employment, to poor upper castes may promote equity. However, the predominant focus should remain on SC/ST and OBC groups. On the creamy layer issue, a balanced case-by-case approach is recommended. Reservation policies in India need to evolve to match the needs of a changing society. But their core principles of remedying historical injustices and achieving substantive equity should remain unchanged. The aim should be an inclusive India where members of all communities are able to realize their full potential.
