Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Its Diagnosis, Treatment, and Impact

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is a relatively common medical condition that causes tingling, numbness, and weakness in the hands. It occurs due to compression of the median nerve that provides sensation to the palm side of the thumb and fingers. The median nerve passes through a narrow passageway in the wrist called the carpal tunnel. Swelling or inflammation in this area can put pressure on the nerve and lead to CTS.

Common symptoms of CTS include tingling, numbness, burning, and pain in the thumb and first three fingers, often provoked or worsened by activities involving repetitive or forceful use of the hands such as typing or driving. Diagnosis of CTS is usually made based on symptoms and physical examination. Diagnostic tests such as nerve conduction studies and electromyography can also be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and check for other conditions. Treatments for CTS depends on the severity of symptoms and range from conservative options to surgery.

Conservative treatment includes wrist splints, rest, icing the wrist, over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications and occupational therapy. Steroid injections may provide temporary relief. These options are typically tried first before considering surgery. However, if symptoms persist or worsen, especially in severe cases, the definitive treatment for CTS is usually surgery to relieve pressure on the median nerve through a procedure called carpal tunnel release. Surgery opens up the carpal tunnel and provides immediate relief from nerve compression. While effective, it does carry risks like infection, blood clots, and damage to the nerve or blood vessels.

According to estimates, CTS affects 4-5% of the population and accounts for about 90% of all nerve compression disorders. In the U.S., around 500,000 people opt for carpal tunnel release surgery each year making it one of the most common surgeries. CTS has significant impact on workforce productivity and the economy with over $20 billion in worker's compensation claims paid out between 2004 and 2013.  Many cases are believed to be work-related due to highly repetitive manual tasks, forceful wrist movements, and hand tool usage. As a result, jobs like assembly line work, typists, cashiers, and food processing carry the highest risk of developing work-related CTS.

In conclusion, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome refers to nerve compression in the wrist that leads to hand pain, numbness and weakness. It is diagnosed based on symptoms and electromyography. Treatment options include rest, splints, medications, steroid injections and ultimately surgery to relieve nerve compression. CTS has a major impact on the economy and workforce through worker's compensation claims and loss of productivity due to a predominantly work-related condition. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment including ergonomic modifications to reduce hand stress and strain are key to managing Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
