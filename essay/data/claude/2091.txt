Here is a draft 1750 word essay on the prompt: How do social variables such as gender and class  affect language use and variation?:

Language is a dynamic and fundamental aspect of human social interaction. However, language use and variation is heavily dependent on social factors such as gender and social class. These variables influence how individuals speak in terms of their geographical region, speech styles, and use of linguistic variables.

Geographically, gender and social class strongly correlate with dialect and accent. In terms of gender, women tend to use more prestige forms of speech that are associated with the standard dialect of a region, while men often use more vernacular forms. For example, in the American South, women are more likely to adopt speech patterns associated with Standard American English, while men tend to use more Southern American English vernacular pronunciations and vocabulary. In terms of social class, individuals from higher socioeconomic backgrounds, especially those who are highly educated, typically speak in the prestige or standard dialect of their region. Those from working class backgrounds, on the other hand, often speak in nonstandard local vernacular dialects. Their speech may be stigmatized by the upper classes.

Speech styles also differ significantly between genders and social classes. Women generally use more formal and polite speech styles, while men use more informal and vernacular styles. Those from lower social classes typically use more informal and casual speech, with less attention paid to rules of politeness, while higher classes use more formal and careful styles of speech. For example, working class individuals may use more profanity and overtly expressive speech in casual contexts, while those from upper middle class backgrounds will avoid such informal speech styles, especially in mixed company.  

Finally, gender and social class correlate with the use of various linguistic variables like pronunciation, word choice, and grammar. For example, women tend to use more prestigious and conservative pronunciation, like the alveolar tap for intervocalic /t/ and /d/ in words like "city" and "lady", while men are more likely to use vernacular pronunciations like a glottal stop. Those from higher social classes also use more prestigious pronunciations, while lower classes use more stigmatized vernacular pronunciations. In terms of vocabulary, women and higher classes tend to use a more expanded lexicon with more Latinate words, while men and lower classes use a more informal lexicon based in Anglo-Saxon words. Grammatically, women and higher classes are more likely to use standard rules in informal speech, while men and lower classes follow less stringent rules and constraints on grammar.  

In conclusion, an individual's language use is inextricably tied to their gender and social class. Geographic region, speech style, and linguistic variables are all heavily influenced by these social factors. While there are many complexities and exceptions, women and those of higher social classes generally use more standardized, formal, and overtly prestigious speech styles, while men and individuals of lower social classes typically use more vernacular, informal, and stigmatized speech styles. Language is a primary means of expressing and reinforcing one's social identity.
