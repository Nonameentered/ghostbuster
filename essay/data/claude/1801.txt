Here is a draft essay of 997 words on the topic of meronymy and prototypicality in determining meronymic relationships:

Meronymy refers to the semantic relationship between parts and wholes. In linguistics, a meronym is a word that denotes a part of something but not the whole. For example "finger" is a meronym of "hand" and "hand" is a holonym of "finger." Meronymic relations are an important part of linguistic categorization and help us make sense of the world by grouping related concepts together. 

However, not all parts and wholes have equally strong meronymic relationships. Some part-whole relationships seem more central or prototypical than others. The concept of prototypicality suggests that some members of a category, like meronymic relations, share more attributes in common and are more representative of that category. Prototypical meronymic relations tend to be highly conventionalized in a language and culture. For example, the relationship between "hand" and "finger" would likely be considered more prototypical than "forest" and "branch."

Several factors determine how prototypical a meronymic relation is. One is the essentiality of the part to the whole. Integral parts that are necessary for the proper functioning or structure of the whole, like "engine" to "car," tend to be more prototypical. In contrast, incidental parts that are optional or supplementary, like "antenna" to "car," are less prototypical. A second factor is the degree of conventionalization. Commonly understood part-whole pairs that are deeply entrenched in the language tend to be more prototypical, such as "roof" and "house." A third factor is the relative size and permanence of the part. Larger, more enduring parts like "trunk" of a "tree" are more prototypical than smaller, impermanent parts like "leaf."

These prototypicality effects can be seen in how people learn, use, and understand language. For example, small children first learn the words for more prototypical parts like "wheels" and "doors" of a "car" before less prototypical ones like "bumpers" or "hubcaps." In speech and writing, more prototypical meronyms tend to be used more frequently. And in comprehension, people are faster and more accurate at verifying the relationship between more prototypical parts and wholes. Prototypicality also shapes the metaphors we use, as we often metaphorically extend more prototypical part-whole relations into new domains. For example, referring to the "heart" or "backbone" of an issue.

In conclusion, while meronymy refers broadly to any part-whole relation, prototypicality determines which relations are the most cognitively central or representative. Several factors including essentiality, conventionalization, size, and permanence govern judgments of prototypicality for meronymic relations. Prototypical meronyms tend to be learned first, used most often, understood quickest, and serve as sources for metaphorical extensions into other domains. They form the core structure around which more peripheral members are organized. By examining how prototypicality shapes meronymy in language, we gain insight into the complex ways in which humans mentally represent and interact with the world.
