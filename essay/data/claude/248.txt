The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a powerful model organism for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying early development. The C. elegans embryo is remarkably simple, with only 671 cells in the adult hermaphrodite, yet shares many genetic and cellular processes with more complex animals. The early C. elegans embryo is ideal for studying cell fate specification and asymmetry in development.

After fertilization, the C. elegans zygote divides asymmetrically into two blastomeres of different sizes and fates: the bigger AB cell and the smaller P1 cell. This first division establishes the initial anterior-posterior asymmetry in the embryo. The asymmetric division is controlled by the PAR proteins, which become asymmetrically distributed in the zygote to define the anterior and posterior poles. The PAR proteins then regulate downstream processes that lead to differences in cell size, position of mitotic spindles, and ultimate daughter cell fate.

The initial asymmetry established in the zygote is reinforced and amplified in subsequent cell divisions through the action of multiple maternal effect genes. These genes are expressed during oogenesis and their mRNAs and proteins are deposited in the egg to control early development before zygotic gene expression begins. For example, the maternal gene skn-1 is required for the asymmetric first division. In skn-1 mutants, the first division produces two blastomeres of equal size, disrupting cell fate specification. Other maternal effect genes similarly control cell polarity, spindle positioning, and cell fate in early embryos.

Cell-cell interactions also play an important role in establishing asymmetry and specifying cell fates. The AB and P1 blastomeres signal to each other through Delta-Notch signaling to regulate their division patterns. Disrupting Delta-Notch signaling causes both blastomeres to adopt the AB-like fate. Later, the 4-cell embryo exhibits two signaling centers, the ABa/p cells, that express ligands inducing distinct fates in the P2 and EMS blastomeres they contact.  

The C. elegans embryo undergoes a highly stereotypical pattern of early divisions leading to the formation of 6 founder cells with distinct cell fatesâ€”AB, MS, C, D, P4, and EMS. Each founder cell then divides asymmetrically in a stem-cell like manner to produce diverse cell types. Studying the regulation of asymmetry and cell fate specification during these divisions provides fundamental insights into the conserved molecular mechanisms controlling cell differentiation and morphogenesis.  

C. elegans has been instrumental as a model system due to several key advantages. The embryo develops rapidly outside the mother, allowing for easy visualization and manipulation of cells. C. elegans also has a small genome size, short life cycle, and is highly fecund, enabling rapid progress through genetics and molecular analyses. However, there are challenges to fully understanding these early developmental processes. Many maternal effect genes likely remain to be discovered, and their interactions are complex. Cell-cell signaling also involves partially redundant pathways, and the functions of some PAR proteins remain enigmatic. 

Despite these challenges, research in C. elegans continues to reveal fundamental insights into how a single cell, the zygote, can generate an entire complex organism through the regulated establishment of asymmetry and specification of diverse cell fates. The elucidation of these early developmental pathways in such a simple model system provides a critical foundation for understanding morphogenesis and cell differentiation across evolution.
