Aristotle discussed the concept of eudaimonia, loosely translated as happiness or human flourishing, in two of his major works: the Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics. In the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle defines eudaimonia as "an activity of soul in accordance with virtue" and discusses the virtues and ethical habits needed to achieve it. In the Eudemian Ethics, eudaimonia seems to be portrayed as a more contemplative state, achieved through the cultivation of theoretical wisdom. At first glance, these appear to be two quite different accounts of eudaimonia that are hard to reconcile. 

However, upon closer examination, Aristotle's accounts can be reconciled by understanding several points. First, for Aristotle, virtue and wisdom are not mutually exclusive - in fact, he believes virtue is a prerequisite for wisdom. So the active virtue discussed in the Nicomachean Ethics supports the contemplative wisdom discussed in the Eudemian Ethics. Second, Aristotle believes that the highest good for humans must be self-sufficient and final - it is the end goal that all other goods aim at. Eudaimonia, as articulated in both works, meets this requirement. 

Third, Aristotle acknowledges that there are different modes of virtue and wisdom available to different people based on their abilities and circumstances. So the virtue of a political leader may differ from that of a philosopher, but both can achieve eudaimonia. Fourth, Aristotle recognizes stages along the path to eudaimonia, from moral virtue to intellectual virtue to theoretical wisdom. So the active virtue described in one work and the contemplative wisdom described in the other can be seen as points along a continuum.

Finally, for Aristotle, the best sort of eudaimonia is contemplative, but he also recognizes the eudaimonia that can be achieved through morally virtuous action. So the two accounts represent the optimal form of human flourishing, and a more general eudaimonia open to a wider range of people. In these ways, Aristotle's concept of eudaimonia as articulated in the Nicomachean Ethics and Eudemian Ethics can be reconciled as complementary parts of his overarching ethical philosophy. While the specifics of the accounts differ, the core message - that eudaimonia comes from the actualization of our highest capacities in accordance with virtue and wisdom - remains consistent across the works. With an understanding of Aristotle's broader ethical theories and concepts, his two accounts of eudaimonia can be interpreted as mutually reinforcing rather than contradictory.
