According to the passage, several factors contributed to the creation and unification of the early Egyptian state. Three of the most significant factors were ideology, warfare, and religion.

The ideology of divine kingship was crucial in unifying the early Egyptian state. Egyptian rulers adopted the idea that they had a divine right to rule and were descended from the gods. The divine king was seen as the intermediary between gods and humans. This belief gave the king authority over all of Egypt and granted legitimacy to the state itself. With a ruler seen as semi-divine, the various regions and peoples of Egypt could become politically and culturally integrated into a single state. The ideology of divine kingship was thus an essential factor in the rise of the unified Egyptian state. 

Warfare and conquest also played a key role in state formation. Early Egyptian rulers, especially during the early Dynastic Period, engaged in military campaigns to conquer surrounding territories, incorporate them into the Egyptian state, and expand the territory under their control. Through warfare, Egypt was able to gain control over Lower Egypt, Upper Egypt, and adjacent lands like Nubia. Victory in battle also enhanced the prestige and legitimacy of the ruler. The spoils of war, including goods, resources, and captives, enriched the state and allowed the king to reward followers. The Egyptian military was thus crucial in conquering lands that would eventually unify into a single Egyptian state.

Religion was also integral to the process of state formation in Egypt. Early Egyptian rulers promoted a uniform religious system across Egypt, with a state cult centered on the king and certain deities like the sun god Ra. The construction of massive pyramids and other monuments throughout Egypt demonstrated the ruler's religious authority and consolidated religious practices. A shared religious system gave the Egyptians a common identity and purpose under the authority of the king and his court. The state also gained economically from tributes and taxes on religious lands and institutions. In these ways, the establishment of a uniform state religion was key to the unification of Egypt under a central government.

In conclusion, the passage discusses several factors that were instrumental in the rise of the early unified Egyptian state: ideology, warfare, and religion. The belief in the divine king gave legitimacy to the ruler's authority; military conquests incorporated new lands into the state; and the creation of a shared religious system unified the Egyptians culturally and politically under the king and his court. Together, these factors allowed Egypt to develop into a powerful, centralized kingdom from the amalgamation of smaller territories along the Nile River valley.
