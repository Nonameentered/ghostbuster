The fundamental objection to Naturalist Moral Realism is that there appears to be a tension between the realist idea that moral judgements purport to represent objective moral facts and the internalist idea that moral judgements necessarily motivate those who make them. This is known as the motivational objection. If moral judgements are just descriptions of moral facts, then there is no obvious reason why they should motivate us to act. Our beliefs about matters of fact generally do not motivate us in themselves. But moral judgements do seem to have a necessary connection with motivation and practical reasoning. Naturalist Moral Realists have sought to resolve this tension in different ways.

Michael Smith proposes that we can reconcile realism and internalism if we accept a Humean theory of motivation according to which beliefs and desires are distinct mental states and motivation arises from the interaction of suitable beliefs and desires. On this view, moral judgements represent moral facts and motivate us when conjoined with appropriate moral desires. When I judge that I ought to Φ in some situation, this judgement represents the fact that Φ-ing is what I have most reason to do in that situation. But for this judgement to motivate me, I must also have a desire to do what I have most reason to do. The desire provides the motivational 'oomph'.

David Brink and David Copp argue that Smith's solution is unsuccessful. Brink argues that the Humean theory of motivation is problematic and that beliefs can themselves be motivating in some contexts, including the moral context. The fact that moral judgements represent objective moral facts gives them a built-in motivational force. Copp argues that even if we accept the Humean theory, Smith's argument fails because moral judgements have motivational force even when conjoined with non-moral desires, not only moral desires. If I judge that I morally ought to help someone in need but have no desire to be moral, I may still feel motivated to help due to sympathetic concern for their wellbeing. 

In response, Smith could argue that moral desires need not take the narrow form of a desire to do what is morally right. Caring about the wellbeing of others or believing that we have reasons to help those in need could also reflect morally inspired desires. However, this response seems ad hoc. Not all sympathetic or benevolent motivations need be the product of morally inspired desires. As Copp argues, the motivational power of moral judgements appears to outstrip that which could be produced by our non-moral desires and interests alone.

In light of these arguments, I do not believe Smith's solution succeeds in reconciling naturalist moral realism and motivational internalism. At best, Smith shows that moral judgements can motivate if conjoined with suitable desires, but not that they necessarily motivate in the way internalists envisage. However, this does not show that naturalist moral realism must be false. An alternative approach is to reject the internalist requirement that moral judgements necessarily motivate as a 'queer' or objectionable feature of our moral psychology. Moral judgements aim at truth, not motivation. They represent moral facts but motivation depends on contingent psychological factors. This preserves realism at the cost of embracing externalism about moral motivation.

In conclusion, while Smith proposes an interesting attempt to reconcile naturalist moral realism and motivational internalism, his solution faces significant problems. A more radical but intuitive approach is to reject internalism and embrace an externalist view of moral motivation instead. This avoids the objection that realism cannot account for moral motivation but acknowledges the complex, contingent relationship between our moral judgements and our moral actions. Naturalist moral realism can survive without the dubious claim that motivation is built into moral truth.
