Friction has significant effects on upsetting and heading of aluminium samples. Upsetting refers to compression of a sample along its length, while heading refers to compression of a sample perpendicular to its length. 

During upsetting and heading, friction at the interface between the samples and the compression tools causes the aluminium to stick to the tools. This results in barreling of the sample, where its middle section expands out. The friction prevents the edges of the sample from moving outward. This reduces the possible deformation and work hardening of the sample. Using lubrication, like grease, oil or graphite, at the interfaces can minimize sticking and allow for more uniform deformation of the sample.

Friction also generates heat during upsetting and heading. The heat causes the aluminium to soften, as its yield strength decreases with increasing temperature. The softened aluminium requires less force to deform. However, too much heat can be problematic, as it may exceed the recrystallization temperature of the aluminium, which would reduce its work hardening. Lubrication helps dissipate heat from the interfaces, preventing overheating of the sample. It allows controlled softening of the aluminium through warm working.

Surface defects and cracks can also initiate at the highly stressed interfaces during upsetting and heading. Lubrication helps prevent surface damage by allowing the samples to slide against the tools. It also minimizes tension and shear stresses at the surfaces that can cause cracks. The surface finish of the tools and lubrication method should be selected to optimize friction for a given application. 

In summary, friction affects aluminium upsetting and heading by causing barreling, heating, and surface damage. The use of lubrication helps address these issues by facilitating uniform deformation, enabling warm working, reducing stresses, and ultimately improving the workability of aluminium. With proper lubrication and tooling, aluminium can be readily formed into different shapes through upsetting and heading.
