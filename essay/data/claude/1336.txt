Evidence of pathology, age, sex, and stature can be determined from analyzing two osteological collections recovered from Hulton Abbey. By examining the remains for signs of disease or injury, inferences can be made about the health and living conditions of the individuals. Pathologies like arthritis, fractures, and dental caries are commonly identified in archaeological samples and can provide insights into activity patterns, diet, and access to health care. 

The sex of individuals can be estimated by examining sexually dimorphic traits of the skull and pelvis. Features such as the nuchal crest, mastoid process, supraorbital margin, and sciatic notch tend to be more pronounced in males. The overall size and robusticity of remains can also indicate sex. Age at death can be determined by assessing the wear on teeth, epiphyseal fusion of long bones, and changes to the pubic symphysis and auricular surface of the ilium.

Stature can be calculated from inputting measurements of the femur, tibia, ulna, and radius into regression formulae that provide estimates of living height. These formulae are based on measurements of individuals of known height and sex. The long bones of the limbs are used because there are well-established correlations between their maximum lengths and stature.

In summary, analysis of the two osteological collections from Hulton Abbey can provide a wealth of information about the individuals interred at the site. Evidence of pathology, sex, age at death, and living stature can be determined using standard methods employed by biological anthropologists and archaeologists. Interpreting these data can shed light on health, lifestyle, and mortality within this medieval population.
