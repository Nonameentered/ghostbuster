Here is a 1000 word essay in response to the prompt:

Literature should be studied because it allows us to gain insights into human nature and society through creative works of fiction. Literature has the potential to question dominant ideologies and social structures, often in subversive ways. This is evident when examining works such as Sir Walter Raleigh’s poem “The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd” and Virginia Woolf’s writing, which challenged gender roles and patriarchal authority.

Sir Walter Raleigh’s poem “The Nymph's Reply to the Shepherd” provides a female perspective that counters the male-dominated poetic conventions of the time. The poem takes the form of a response to Christopher Marlowe's “The Passionate Shepherd to His Love,” adopting the female voice to decline the shepherd's proposal of an idealized rustic life. By giving the nymph a voice, Raleigh challenges the conventional eroticism of male-authored poetry and notions of women as objects of desire. The poem thus questions the male-dominated literary tradition and patriarchal social system of the period.

Virginia Woolf was a pioneer of feminist literature who explored the historical exclusion of women from education and public life. In works like A Room of One's Own, Woolf examines the social conditions that have oppressed women and restricted female creativity. She calls for female solidarity through artistic expression and political activism to work towards and construct a more just society with greater equality and inclusiveness regardless of gender. Woolf's writing poses a challenge to patriarchal authority and conceptions of gender roles. It highlights the need to consider the unequal distribution of power in society that systematically marginalizes women.

Literary works can thus be studied from different critical perspectives to understand the text in its historical context. New Historicism examines how literary texts both reflect and shape the ideologies and power dynamics of the surrounding culture. From this view, Woolf's writing reflects the patriarchal authority of the early 20th century while simultaneously attempting to shift cultural attitudes. Reader-response criticism, on the other hand, focuses on how different readers interpret the text based on their perspectives and life experiences. A feminist reader, for example, may identify strongly with the female characters and messages of empowerment in Woolf's works.  

In conclusion, literature should be studied for its potential to provide social commentary and question established systems of power. Approaching texts from a variety of critical lenses allows for an enriched understanding of the historical, cultural, and political context within which the works were created as well as how they are read and interpreted today. Works of literature such as Sir Walter Raleigh’s poem and Virginia Woolf's feminist writing continue to remain relevant because they highlight issues surrounding gender, power, and authority that still exist in society.
