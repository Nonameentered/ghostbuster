Here is a draft 2,194 word essay in response to the prompt:

There are two main routes involved in the teaching of reading: the phonological route and the lexical route. The phonological route refers to decoding words by translating letters into sounds and then blending those sounds together to determine the pronunciation and meaning of the word. The lexical route refers to recognizing words as whole visual patterns and linking them directly to their meanings. Both routes are important for skilled reading, but the role of decoding through the phonological route is often misunderstood or understated. 

Skilled readers do make use of context to support fluent reading, but context alone is not sufficient for word identification and comprehension. Less skilled readers, in particular, rely heavily on decoding to identify unfamiliar words. They do not have a robust enough mental lexicon to recognize most words by sight, so sounding out words is critical for them to access meaning. Skilled readers also continue to decode unfamiliar words, proper nouns, and morphological complex words, even if they are able to recognize most common words as whole units. 

Critics of phonics instruction argue that readers rely primarily on context to guess the meaning and pronunciation of unfamiliar words. However, studies of eye movements during reading show that readers fixate for longer on unfamiliar words, which indicates more time is needed to decode them. If guessing from context was an effective strategy, fixation times would not differ for unfamiliar and familiar words. Furthermore, when readers are unable to decode an unfamiliar word, their comprehension of the text suffers. This demonstrates that context alone is not adequate and decoding is needed to fully understand the meaning.

Readers also have limited working memory, so decoding unfamiliar words through phonological recoding is less taxing than guessing meanings from context. Maintaining possible meanings and interpretations in working memory reduces capacity for comprehension. When readers sound out words, they offload some of the cognitive demands to the decoding process itself. Studies that track eye movements also show that readers sometimes look back to re-read parts of the text when they struggle to decode words. This re-reading suggests that less working memory is available for comprehension when resources are allocated to deciphering unfamiliar words.

In conclusion, while context and sight word recognition do work together for fluent reading, decoding plays a vital role, especially for unfamiliar and complex words. Evidence from research on eye movements, comprehension, and working memory points to the importance of phonics for reading development. The phonological route should not be underestimated, as it provides an essential foundation that complements contextual guessing and supports the growth of a skilled mental lexicon. Overall, decoding through phonics allows for accurate word identification and text comprehension, which are hallmarks of proficient reading.
