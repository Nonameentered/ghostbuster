The major commercial polymers with an inorganic silicon-oxygen backbone are the silicones. The most common silicones are the polydimethylsiloxanes, made from dimethyldichlorosilane. To produce silicones, the monomer dichlorodiphenylsilane is first hydrolized by water to form a silanol. The silanol then condenses to form cyclopolysiloxanes of varying ring sizes, from tetramer to octamer. 

The concentration of reactants plays a key role in determining which cyclopolysiloxanes form. At high concentrations, smaller ring sizes are favored because the silanols are in close proximity, allowing rapid condensation. As concentration decreases, larger rings become more probable since the silanols are more distant, requiring more time to collide and condense. An experiment demonstrating this uses dichlorodiphenylsilane in a range of concentrations. At 90% concentration, the primary product is the tetramer. At 60% concentration, a mixture of tetramer, hexamer and octamer form. At 30% concentration, the octamer predominates.

To produce high molecular weight polydimethylsiloxane polymers, the cyclopolysiloxanes are opened and re-polymerized with additional dichlorodiphenylsilane. Various polymer lengths are produced depending on reaction conditions like temperature, time and catalyst.

Impurities in the silicone production include unreacted monomers, low molecular weight oligomers, and cyclic oligomers. Traces of catalyst, water and other solvents may also remain as impurities. The unreacted monomers and low oligomers can often be separated by vacuum distillation. The cyclic oligomers are more difficult to remove and may remain in small amounts in the final polymer. Careful purification steps are required to produce high purity silicones for specialized applications.

In summary, concentration plays an key role in the production of cyclopolysiloxanes, which are intermediates in polymerization to silicones. The inorganic silicon-oxygen backbone gives silicones their unique properties, useful in many applications. With care, high purity silicones can be achieved, but not without challenges in removing certain impurities like cyclic oligomers.
