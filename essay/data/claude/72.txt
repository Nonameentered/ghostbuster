The process of designing and analyzing a reduction gearbox for a commercial meat slicer requires careful consideration of many factors to ensure the gearbox operates efficiently and reliably. Several calculations were performed to determine optimal gear ratios, sizes, shafts, and bearings for the application.

To start, the intended operation and specifications of the meat slicer were analyzed to understand the required input and output speeds, as well as the amount of torque needed to power the slicer blades. Based on this information, a preliminary gear ratio was selected to reduce the high input speed from the motor to a slower output speed for the slicer blades. The gear ratio affects the torque and speed of the system, so multiple ratios were tested in a computer simulation program to compare performance. However, an issue arose with the simulation in that it did not accurately model friction and heat generation within the gearbox, leading to selection of a ratio that was ultimately too high.

The gear sizes were calculated based on the preliminary ratio, required shaft speeds, amount of transmitted torque, and available commercial gear sizes. The gear teeth needed to mesh properly while handling the transmitted forces. Several iterations of the design were required to optimize the gear sizes. The optimal design minimized unused space within the gearbox while avoiding interference between components.

The shaft and bearing sizes were also calculated based on the amount of transmitted torque. The shafts needed to be large enough in diameter to effectively transmit the torque without breaking or deforming while spinning at the required speeds. The bearings were selected to handle the radial and thrust forces generated while supporting the shafts. Specific types of bearings, like ball bearings or needle bearings, were compared based on cost, durability, and operating conditions.

Through an iterative process of calculations, design, simulation, and redesign, an optimal gearbox configuration was developed for the commercial meat slicer application. The final design meets the operating requirements for input and output speeds, transmitted torque, cost, and reliability. With improvements to the simulation software's friction modeling, the initial overestimated gear ratio could have been avoided, highlighting the need for real-world testing to verify theoretical designs. The steps of selecting components based on calculation and simulation, however, allowed for an educated design process rooted in engineering analysis.
