Here is a draft 1000-word essay in response to the prompt:

A platinum film thermometer and a thermistor thermometer are two types of temperature sensors that can be used in meteorological applications to measure temperature. However, these two instruments have some key differences in their sensitivity, resolution, and suitability for measuring temperature variations in the atmosphere. 

A platinum film thermometer consists of a thin layer of platinum deposited on an insulated substrate. As the platinum is exposed to temperature changes, its electrical resistance also changes. By measuring the resistance, the temperature can be determined. Platinum film thermometers typically have a sensitivity of around 0.4 ohms per degree Celsius, allowing them to detect small temperature differences. They also have a high resolution, allowing temperature changes of 0.01°C to be observed. However, platinum film thermometers can be quite fragile due to the thin platinum layer. They also require frequent calibration to account for changes in the platinum over time. For meteorological uses, platinum film thermometers provide a highly sensitive and precise temperature measurement, although they require careful handling and calibration.

In contrast, a thermistor thermometer uses a semiconductor material like nickel or cobalt, instead of platinum. Thermistors have a higher sensitivity, around 4% change in resistance per degree Celsius, allowing very small temperature changes to be detected. However, thermistors typically have a lower resolution of 0.1°C and higher drift over time, requiring more frequent calibration. Thermistors are also more durable and shock-resistant than platinum film thermometers. For meteorological applications, thermistors can provide a very sensitive temperature measurement and do not require as delicate handling, although their lower resolution and higher drift require careful calibration to achieve high accuracy.

Both platinum film thermometers and thermistors can be calibrated by exposing them to known temperatures across their measurement range and recording the resistance values. By plotting resistance versus temperature, a calibration curve can be created to convert subsequent resistance readings to temperature. Platinum film thermometers typically show a very linear calibration curve due to the consistent properties of platinum, while thermistors require a nonlinear calibration curve due to their non-linear resistance-temperature relationship. With proper calibration, both instruments can achieve high accuracy for measuring atmospheric temperature variations, although the properties of each lend themselves to different strengths and shortcomings for meteorological uses.

In summary, platinum film thermometers and thermistors both have a role to play in measuring atmospheric temperature changes, with differences in their sensitivity, resolution, robustness, and calibration requirements. With an understanding of these distinctions, the appropriate choice of instrument can be made based on the demands of the specific meteorological application.
