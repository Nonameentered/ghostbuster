A simple two-layer energy balance model is a highly simplified representation of the climate system. While such models can provide useful insights, they have many limitations in attributing observed climate change to different radiative forcings. 

First, a zero-dimensional model cannot capture spatial variations and dynamics in the climate system. The real climate system involves complex interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, cryosphere, and biosphere across a range of spatial and temporal scales. A two-layer model collapses all of these complexities into a single point and cannot represent spatial patterns of climate change and variability. It also cannot capture effects such as heat transport in the oceans and weather systems in the atmosphere.

Second, a two-layer model represents the atmosphere as just two slabs, one for the lower troposphere and one for the stratosphere. This is an enormous oversimplification of the multiple layers of the actual atmosphere, each with different radiative properties and responses to forcings. The real stratosphere, for example, has complex radiative transfer processes and temperature changes that depend on ozone concentrationsâ€”effects that cannot be captured in a two-layer model. 

Third, the climate sensitivity in a two-layer model depends entirely on the parameterized feedbacks that are built into the model. In reality, climate sensitivity emerges from the complex interplay of feedbacks and interactions across the full climate system. Key feedbacks such as cloud and carbon cycle feedbacks are typically not included or are highly parameterized in a simple energy balance model. So the climate sensitivity of such a model is largely presupposed rather than predicted.

Finally, simple models cannot adequately represent the delayed and extended responses of the deep ocean and ice sheets to radiative perturbations. The deep ocean and cryosphere have immense thermal inertia, with response times of centuries to millennia. But in an energy balance model, the climate equilibrates with radiative changes over timescales of years. So such models cannot properly assess the long-term consequences of historical or ongoing radiative changes.

In conclusion, while simple two-layer models are useful conceptual tools, they have severe limitations in quantifying the attribution of observed climate changes to different forcings. Their zero-dimensional nature, oversimplified representation of atmospheric layers, parameterized feedbacks, and neglect of long response times in the deep ocean and cryosphere mean that they provide limited insights into the complex realities of the climate system. More sophisticated three-dimensional models with fully interactive components are needed to properly attribute the causes of historical and ongoing climate change.
