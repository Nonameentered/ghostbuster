The late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a boom in skyscraper construction in the United States, especially in cities like Chicago and New York. Several interrelated factors drove this rise of the skyscraper during this period.

One key factor was the invention of new building technologies that made taller buildings feasible. Two of the most important were the elevator and steel construction. Elevators were crucial as they allowed skyscrapers to have many more floors that were still accessible to building users and occupants. The earliest elevators were powered by steam and hydraulic pumps, but electric elevators emerged in the 1880s and made skyscrapers physically and financially viable. Steel construction was also critical, as steel beams and frames enabled the construction of taller structures that could support more weight. The Home Insurance Building in Chicago, completed in 1885, was one of the first to use a steel frame, allowing it to reach 10 stories. Steel and elevators were essential to unlocking the potential height of skyscrapers. 

A second factor was increased land values and demand for office space in cities. As cities grew rapidly in population, the value of centrally located land increased substantially. Constructing taller buildings was a way to maximize the return on expensive land. At the same time, there was increasing demand for office space to house the growing number of white-collar workers and companies in cities. Skyscrapers provided an innovative solution to increasing the supply of office space. The race to build the worldâ€™s tallest building demonstrated how prestige and competition between cities and companies also fueled demand for skyscrapers.

A third factor was an entrepreneurial spirit and optimism that new innovations could be developed to solve technical and social challenges. Architects and engineers at the time sought to push the boundaries of the possible with new building designs. There was a belief that any obstacles to skyscrapers, whether economic, social, or technological could be overcome. Skyscrapers embodied this spirit of ambition, innovation, and possibility.

In conclusion, the rise of the skyscraper was the result of the interplay between new building technologies, increasing land values and demand for space, and an entrepreneurial spirit of innovation. These factors coalesced to drive the flurry of skyscraper construction that redefined city skylines in the U.S. at the turn of the 20th century. Overall, the skyscraper became a symbol of progress, possibility, and the modern age.
