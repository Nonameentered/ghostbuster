A recent survey of Reading University students aimed to assess their dietary habits and nutrient intakes to determine how these compared to recommended Dietary Reference Values (DRV) established by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (COMA). The survey found that while students’ diets included a range of foods and nutrients, several key areas fell short of DRV recommendations, including energy, key vitamins and minerals, protein, and fiber.

In terms of calorie intake, female students fell short of the DRV, consuming only around 1,800 kcal per day compared to the recommended 2,000 kcal. For male students, calorie consumption was closer to recommended levels at around 2,500 kcal. These lower energy intakes, particularly for females, are likely linked to body weight concerns and a desire to avoid weight gain during college years. However, such restricted energy intakes also mean it is difficult to meet other nutrient needs.  

Students’ diets lacked certain key vitamins and minerals, including vitamins D, B12, folate, and the minerals iron, calcium, magnesium, and iodine. Many of these are critical for health, growth, and development in young adults. For example, iron is essential for red blood cell production and preventing anemia, while folate and calcium are important for functions like cell division and bone health. Low intakes of these nutrients can increase the risk of problems over the longer term if diets are not improved.

Protein intakes appeared reasonable overall, at around 63 grams per day for females and 88 grams per day for males. However, protein sources were often less healthy options like burgers, kebabs, and fried chicken rather than lean meats, fish, eggs, or plant-based sources. Fiber intakes were well below recommendations at only 19 grams per day compared to the 30 grams advised. A diet high in fiber is linked to benefits like lower disease risk and better gut health.

In summary, this survey of Reading University students identified several gaps between actual dietary intakes and recommended DRV levels. On average, students consume too little energy and lack adequate amounts of key vitamins, minerals, protein, and fiber. University students represent a key target group for nutrition education and policy interventions to encourage improvements in diet quality and longer-term health. Promoting intake of more nutrient-dense foods and balanced meals, in appropriate portion sizes, would help bridge this nutritional gap.
