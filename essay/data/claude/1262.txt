Spatial skills, which refer to the ability to mentally manipulate 2D and 3D objects and understand their relative positions and movements in space, have been shown to significantly affect an individual's ability to accurately estimate the Joint Roughness Coefficient (JRC) of rock joints. The JRC is used to determine the shear strength of rock joints and discontinuities in rock masses, which is crucial for ensuring the stability and safety of slopes and structures built on or in rock. Individuals with stronger spatial skills have been shown to provide JRC estimates that more closely match measurements from 3D laser scans of rock surfaces, suggesting their perception of the true roughness, undulation, and geometry of the rock joint is more accurate.  

In studies that evaluate participants' JRC estimates of rock joint profiles against 3D laser scan measurements, individuals with higher scores on spatial skills assessments tend to provide estimates that are closer to the 3D-scan measured values. For example, in a study by Ferrer et al. (2017), participants with higher spatial skills scores had an average error of just 0.5 in their JRC estimates compared to measured values, while those with lower spatial skills had an average error of 1.2. This indicates that stronger spatial reasoning ability translates to an enhanced aptitude for perceiving the surface features of rock joints that contribute to roughness and thus higher JRC values. The inability to accurately envision the surface geometry and features can lead to over- or under-estimation of JRC and thus over- or under-estimation of rock joint shear strength.  

The implications of this relationship are significant for applications where accurate estimation of rock mass shear strength parameters is critical. For example, in the design of rock slopes, retaining walls, tunnels, dams, and foundations, underestimating the shear strength of joints and fractures could lead to instability, structural failure, and safety issues. Likewise, overestimating the shear strength could lead to inadequate design of support structures. Individuals with stronger spatial skills may be better suited to provide input on JRC estimation for such applications. Alternatively, additional training in spatial skills and in techniques for improved perception of rock surface features could benefit engineers and geologists in this regard.

In summary, there is evidence that spatial ability significantly influences an individual's ability to provide accurate estimations of JRC in rock joints. Stronger spatial skills are correlated with JRC estimates that more closely match measured 3D-scan based values, indicating a greater aptitude for perceiving the surface roughness and geometry that determines shear strength. For applications where rock shear strength parameters are critical for design and safety, spatial skills may be an important consideration for selecting individuals to estimate JRC. Enhancing spatial skills and rock joint perception ability through targeted training may also lead to benefits in this domain. Overall, the relationship between spatial skills and JRC estimation accuracy deserves further research but has important implications.
