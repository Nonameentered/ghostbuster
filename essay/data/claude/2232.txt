There are several major reasons why interplanetary exploration is such an important endeavor. The value of space exploration is multi-faceted, from gaining scientific insights to enhancing international cooperation.

Scientifically, exploring other worlds in our solar system allows us to better understand the origins of our own planet Earth. By studying the formation and evolution of other planets and moons, we gain insights into how Earth developed and became habitable. Exploring other worlds also allows us to test theories and models of planetary formation in our search for Earth-like exoplanets. The discoveries of extremophile lifeforms on Earth that can survive in harsh conditions also gives hope that life may exist, or could have existed, on other worlds in our solar system. By exploring these worlds, we may someday discover the ultimate revelation - that we are not alone in the universe.

Interplanetary exploration also drives innovation in fields like robotics, computing, materials science, and renewable energy. Solving the technical challenges of space exploration has led to countless spinoff technologies that improve life on Earth, from GPS and memory foam to scratch-resistant lenses and Dustbusters. Future space missions to the outer solar system will push the boundaries of technology even further in order to operate autonomous spacecraft over vast distances.

Politically and economically, space exploration stimulates international cooperation and inspires people around the world. Successful interplanetary missions are a source of national prestige and help countries demonstrate technological and scientific prowess on a global stage. Space exploration also fuels new industries like space tourism and space mining, which some predict could become major sectors of the economy in the coming decades.  

If a probe were placed in orbit around Uranus, there are several areas that would warrant close study. First, Uranus itself would be a major focus of study. The ice giant has only been visited once by Voyager 2 in 1986, so there is still much to learn about its atmosphere, ring system, and magnetosphere. Detailed observations over time could reveal changes in Uranus's weather and climate. Its interior structure and atmospheric dynamics are still not fully understood and could be studied with both remote sensing and in situ observations.

Uranus's moons would also be prime targets for exploration and flybys. Its five largest moons - Titania, Oberon, Ariel, Umbriel, and Miranda - have only been observed from afar and by Voyager 2. High-resolution imaging and spectroscopy would reveal their geological histories and determine if any might have conditions suitable for life. Miranda in particular shows signs of a violent past and would be fascinating to study up close. Exploring these moons could reveal valuable clues to help understand Uranus's formation and evolution.

Lastly, exploring Uranus could lead to new discoveries of small moons and ring material. When Voyager 2 visited, it found 10 new moons and Uranus's ring system, which had not previously been detected from Earth. With modern observing techniques, new moons and ring material could potentially be discovered, giving us a more complete picture of the Uranus system. Studying this material in situ could reveal insights into planetary formation and solar system dynamics beyond the orbit of Neptune.

In summary, interplanetary exploration is crucial for gaining scientific insights, driving innovation, and enhancing global cooperation. Placing a probe in orbit around Uranus would open up a whole new world of discovery regarding the ice giant itself, its fascinating satellites, rings, magnetosphere, and potentially new moons and other material in this unexplored region of the outer solar system. Exploration of the Uranus system would yield valuable clues to help understand the formation of our solar system and possibly even conditions necessary for life.
