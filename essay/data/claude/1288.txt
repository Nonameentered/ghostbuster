The Harcourt-Essen reaction refers to the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water when catalyzed by potassium iodide. The kinetics and mechanism of this reaction can be studied to determine key parameters of the reaction known as the Arrhenius parameters, including the activation energy and pre-exponential factor. Understanding these parameters provides insight into the energy requirements and how reactions proceed. They allow scientists to compare the reactivity of different reactions and the effectiveness of different potential catalysts. 

The activation energy of a reaction refers to the minimum amount of energy required for the reaction to proceed. It can be determined experimentally by measuring the reaction rate at different temperatures and plotting the natural log of the rate constant versus the inverse of the temperature in Kelvin. The slope of this line corresponds to the activation energy divided by the gas constant. The pre-exponential factor, often denoted as A, is related to the frequency of collisions of the reactants that have the proper orientation to react. It is determined from the y-intercept of the same plot used to determine the activation energy.

There are a few limitations with the classic Harcourt-Essen experiment for determining these parameters for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide is difficult to measure precisely, especially since it decomposes during the course of the reaction and experiment. Small errors in concentration measurement can translate to significant errors in the calculated rate constants and activation energy. Another source of error is that the volume of oxygen gas produced is measured, requiring correction for temperature and pressure to determine the number of moles. 

Some improvements could be made to address these limitations. Using an excess of potassium iodide ensures that concentration of the catalyst is not a limiting factor, so that the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is the only factor affecting rate. Measuring the concentration of hydrogen peroxide before and after the reaction using a technique like titration with potassium permanganate could provide more accurate values. Finally, measuring the pressure change directly using a pressure sensor would provide a more precise measurement of the number of moles of oxygen produced.

In summary, the Harcourt-Essen reaction provides an opportunity to determine important kinetic parameters of a reaction, the activation energy and pre-exponential factor. Understanding these parameters provides critical insights into the energy profile and mechanism of a reaction. Limitations in measuring the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and volume of oxygen produced can be addressed using an excess of catalyst, measuring peroxide concentration directly, and direct pressure measurements. Implementing these improvements would allow for a more precise determination of the Arrhenius parameters for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.
