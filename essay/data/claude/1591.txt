Here is a draft 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

Indigenous culture based tourism refers to tourism that showcases the cultural heritage, traditions, and values of indigenous populations. While this form of tourism has the potential to provide economic opportunities and cultural revitalization for indigenous groups, it also often leads to unintended negative consequences that must be addressed. The case of the Maori in New Zealand illustrates the complex impacts of indigenous tourism. 

On the positive side, indigenous tourism can be an important source of income and job creation for indigenous communities that face higher rates of poverty and unemployment. Revenue from tourism can be used to fund cultural preservation and revitalization efforts. For the Maori, cultural tourism has helped raise awareness of Maori cultural traditions both domestically and internationally. Cultural events like powhiri (welcome ceremonies) and hangi (meals) are popular attractions, allowing visitors to engage with Maori cultural practices in an authentic way.

However, indigenous tourism also raises concerns about misappropriation and stereotyping of culture. There is a risk of reducing complex cultures into simplified tourist attractions and experiences. In New Zealand, some argue Maori cultural practices have been appropriated and diluted to appeal to tourist expectations. The haka, for example, a traditional dance form, is now widely performed for tourists, potentially losing some of its cultural significance. Indigenous groups also often have little control or input into how their culture is represented to tourists. 

A related issue is the unequal distribution of economic benefits from tourism. Although tourism provides opportunities, indigenous groups frequently have limited involvement in the planning and operation of tourism businesses. Profits often flow to external tourism companies and operators instead. This has been the case for the Maori, as most tourism companies in New Zealand are owned by non-Maori. Granting indigenous groups more control and decision-making power over tourism policy and planning is necessary to address this imbalance.

There are also concerns about the environmental and societal impacts of increased tourism on indigenous communities. Natural sites and attractions can suffer degradation from overuse while higher demand for temporary housing and transportation can drive up costs of living. Among the Maori, the increased numbers of tourists have put strain on infrastructure and led to overcrowding at historic sites like Rotorua. Managing these negative externalities and maximizing the benefits of indigenous tourism requires holistic policy frameworks that prioritize indigenous involvement and perspectives.

In conclusion, while indigenous culture based tourism has significant potential for supporting indigenous culture and economic development, there are also risks of misappropriation of culture, unequal distribution of economic benefits, and degradation of natural and societal environments. Ensuring indigenous groups have greater control and input over tourism policy and planning is key to maximizing the benefits of this industry and promoting truly sustainable and equitable indigenous tourism. Overall, a balanced and well-regulated approach to indigenous tourism can positively impact both indigenous communities and society as a whole through intercultural understanding and shared economic opportunities.
