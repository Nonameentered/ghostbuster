The rivalry between Argentina's two most popular football clubs, Boca Juniors and River Plate, has had an enormous impact on Argentine society both historically and today. Known as the Superclásico, matches between Boca and River are some of the most important sporting events in Argentina and starkly divide the football fandom of the country. 

Boca Juniors and River Plate are the two most successful football clubs in Argentina, having won a combined 66 league titles. They are based in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of La Boca and the Núñez district, respectively. The rivalry between the two clubs began in the early 20th century and intensified as they competed for championships and fans. Matches between them, known as the Superclásico, have come to be regarded as the biggest football rivalry in South America due to the clubs' huge popularity and success.

Historically, the rivalry reflected deeper social divisions in Buenos Aires based on class and race. Boca was seen as a club of the working class, with a stadium located in a poor immigrant neighborhood. River was viewed as an upper class club, with a stadium in a leafy, affluent part of the city. The rivalry thus embodied wider social tensions in Argentine society. However, today the clubs' fanbases are much more socioeconomically diverse, though the historical perceptions still persist.

The Superclásico is arguably the most important fixture in Argentine football and improvements one of the most viewed sporting events in the world. When Boca and River play, the country comes to a standstill. Fans plan their schedules around the matches and families are often divided in their support for the rival teams. The passion and drama surrounding the Superclásico reflect the importance of football to Argentina's culture and identity.

It reflects Argentina's passion for football and the sport's deep connections to the nation's culture and identity. Though the social dynamics around the rivalry have evolved over time, the Superclásico remains an event of unparalleled importance to Argentines and shows how football can be a powerful force in bringing communities together.
