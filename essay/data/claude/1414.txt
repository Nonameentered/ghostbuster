Here is a draft essay in 4500 words on the issues and challenges faced by feminist researchers in social research and how they apply to Marjorie Shostak's text 'Nisa: The Life and Words of !Kung Woman':

Introduction 

Feminist researchers conducting social research face a number of significant issues and challenges. These arise from the male-dominated nature of much existing research and social structures, as well as the political nature of feminist research which seeks to challenge existing social hierarchies and gender inequalities. This essay will explore these issues and challenges, including: tackling androcentric research biases; the political and ethical dilemmas of 'speaking for others'; negotiating researcher-participant power dynamics and building trust; and ensuring research benefits for marginalised groups like women. It will evaluate how these challenges apply to Marjorie Shostak's ethnographic study Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman, based on her research conducting life-history interviews with Nisa, a !Kung woman from Botswana.  

Androcentric biases

A key issue faced by feminist researchers is androcentric bias in existing research and theory. Much traditional research reflects a male perspective, ignoring or marginalising women's experiences. Feminist researchers must critically analyse existing knowledge and assumptions to identify and challenge these biases. They aim to address the gender imbalance by placing women's experiences at the centre of analysis. However, this requires extra effort to counter prevailing androcentric models and ways of thinking. 

Shostak explicitly aimed to address the lack of women's voices in accounts of !Kung life. Her study was ground-breaking in focusing on a woman's experiences. However, at times she does not fully overcome an androcentric bias, discussing Nisa's experiences in relation to men's lives and status in the community. Her analysis could have been strengthened by adopting a more woman-centred framework. Still, Nisa's own words provide a rare and invaluable insight into women's experiences in this cultural context.

Political and ethical dilemmas

Feminist research is political in nature, aiming to challenge patriarchal structures and empower women. However, this can create political and ethical dilemmas for feminist researchers. They must navigate complex power dynamics in their relationship with research participants and consider how to represent participants' experiences in a sensitive way while also achieving political goals.
