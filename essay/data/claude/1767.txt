Here is a 750-word essay on the use of language and form in Aphra Behn's poem "Song: Love Armed":

Aphra Behn's poem "Song: Love Armed" relies on strong imagery and metaphorical language to convey its message about the power of Love and Beauty. Behn personifies Love as a figure carrying various weapons to conquer victims. The repeated use of military and warfare motifs emphasizes the formidable might and inevitable triumph of Love. The rigid rhyme scheme and regular meter also serve to reflect the orderly and inevitable march of Love's forces.

The opening stanza introduces Love as a "mighty hero" who comes "glorious to the field". The militaristic imagery is sustained throughout the poem, as Love "his little bow and arrow bears" and Beauty serves as "arms". Reference to "quiver" and "dart" further this metaphor of Cupid's bow and arrow as weapons of love. The victims of love have "no defense" and are "conquered", just as opposing forces are defeated in battle. Love's "empire" grows as a result of these triumphs on the "field". The dominance of military terminology transforms the poetic experience of love and courtship into a campaign of conquests by an invincible commander. 

The strict rhyme scheme reinforces this impression of Love as a disciplined and systematic assailant. The poem follows an orderly pattern of rhyming couplets, with an ABCBDBEB rhyme scheme. The repetition of rhyming sounds gives the verse a steady, measured quality, reflecting the methodical advance of Love's forces. For example, the first four lines end in "hero/arrow/field/feel" with a similar vowel sound, conveying a sense of consistent progress. The regular iambic tetrameter also contributes to this effect of an advancing army with its steady "ba-DUM ba-DUM ba-DUM ba-DUM" rhythm.

In conclusion, Behn's creative use of extended military metaphor and a highly structured form helps personify Love as an invincible general conquering all in its path. The poet transforms the familiar topos of love and beauty into an unconventional representation of affection and desire as a military campaign. This imaginative insight, conveyed through the poem's diction, imagery, and prosody, gives "Song: Love Armed" a distinct and compelling perspective on the irresistible power of Love.
