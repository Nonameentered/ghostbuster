Mr He's fainting episode could be due to several possible diagnoses, including vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias like bradycardia or heart block. Further investigations should be carried out to determine the underlying cause of his bradyarrhythmia and appropriate treatment.

Vasovagal syncope is a common cause of transient loss of consciousness and can occur in normal hearts in response to emotional distress or pain. It results from a drop in heart rate and blood pressure triggered by the vagus nerve. An electrocardiogram (ECG) during the episode can help confirm the diagnosis. Orthostatic hypotension refers to a drop in blood pressure upon standing and can also lead to dizziness or syncope. It can usually be diagnosed with a tilt-table test.

Cardiac causes like bradycardia (slow heart rate <60bpm) or heart block (impaired conduction of electrical signals in the heart) can also result in syncope and require further cardiac investigations. A 24-hour Holter ECG monitor can detect any intermittent bradycardia or heart block over a longer period. An ECG can diagnose heart block by showing delayed or failed transmission of impulse from the atria to ventricles.

The three degrees of heart block can have varying severity. First-degree heart block has a prolonged PR interval but normal QRS complexes and heart rate. It usually does not require treatment but needs regular monitoring. Second-degree heart block has intermittent non-conducted beats and can be either Wenckebach type with progressively lengthening PR intervals or Mobitz type II with constant PR intervals. Wenckebach type usually does not require treatment while Mobitz type II may require a pacemaker. Complete or third-degree heart block has no conduction between atria and ventricles. It requires urgent installation of a temporary pacemaker followed by a permanent pacemaker. 

Potential complications of pacemaker insertion include infection, lead dislodgement, pneumothorax, cardiac perforation, and venous thrombosis. Following pacemaker implantation, regular checks should be conducted to monitor pacemaker function and detect complications early. Chest X-rays can check proper lead positioning while pacemaker checks can monitor battery status, pacing thresholds, and impedance.

In summary, Mr He's fainting episode could be due to vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotension or heart block. Further ECGs and Holter monitoring should be carried out to diagnose the cause of bradycardia. Heart block of varying severity may require pacemaker implantation, which has certain potential complications that warrant close monitoring.
