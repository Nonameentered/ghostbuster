A pulmonary embolus (PE) refers to a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs, usually due to a blood clot that has traveled from elsewhere in the body, commonly the legs. The clinical features of a PE include pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypoxia. 

An elderly diabetic patient presenting with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath could suggest a PE as a possible diagnosis. However, there are several other conditions that can manifest similarly and must be considered as differentials. These include pneumonia, pneumothorax, heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, pericarditis, and costochondritis. Given the patient’s age and medical comorbidities, a thorough assessment and investigation is required to determine the correct diagnosis and management plan.

A defining symptom of PE is pleuritic chest pain that is sharp and worsens with deep breathing or coughing. This is due to inflammation of the pleura, the thin membranes surrounding the lungs. The shortness of breath occurs as the blockage prevents oxygenated blood from reaching the lungs and vital organs. Tachycardia may be present as the body tries to compensate, and hypoxia may lead to cyanosis in severe cases. 

While PE can be life-threatening if left untreated, other conditions like pneumonia or pneumothorax can appear similar and must be ruled out. Pneumonia may feature productive cough, fever, and crackles whereas pneumothorax presents with hyperresonance to percussion and reduced breath sounds on the affected side. Heart failure can also manifest with shortness of breath as well as peripheral edema and orthopnea. An acute coronary syndrome may have similar chest pain but would likely show ECG changes and elevated cardiac enzymes. 

The patient’s medical history of diabetes introduces further complexity. Diabetes impairs immune function and increases infection risk, favoring a diagnosis of pneumonia. However, diabetes also accelerates atherosclerosis, predisposing to PE and acute coronary syndrome. Pericarditis should also be considered, as diabetes can promote inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart. A comprehensive assessment including vital signs, oxygen saturation, ECG, imaging and blood tests is required to distinguish between these possibilities.

In managing such a patient, a person-centred approach as advocated by the National Service Framework for Older People is essential. This means considering the patient’s values and priorities, level of functioning and independence, and social circumstances. Their comorbid diabetes must be managed carefully alongside any newly diagnosed condition. Close monitoring in hospital is usually required for an older person with a life-threatening illness like PE, but unnecessary hospitalization may jeopardize their functional independence if the diagnosis turns out to be one of the more benign differentials.

In summary, a pulmonary embolus should be suspected in an elderly diabetic patient with sudden-onset pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. However, several other conditions may appear similar and must be excluded through proper assessment and investigation in order to arrive at the right diagnosis and optimize management of this complex patient group. A patient-centred approach considering the patient's medical history, comorbidities as well as personal values and priorities is key to achieving the best outcomes.
