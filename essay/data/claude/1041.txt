What Defines a Person?

What makes a person unique? What constitutes personhood—our identity and consciousness—has long been a topic of debate among philosophers. Three key perspectives on what defines a person come from René Descartes, P.F. Strawson, and Charles Foster. While they have different views, together they point to a person being defined by a combination of the mind, the body, relationships, and experiences.

René Descartes saw the mind as central to personhood. In his Meditations on First Philosophy, he proposed that the essence of a person lies in the mind alone. He argued for a strict mind-body dualism: the mind and the body are separate substances. Our mind, which comprises our thoughts, consciousness, and senses, is non-physical and what truly defines us as thinking beings. In contrast, our physical body is like a machine and incidental to our sense of self. For Descartes, as long as our mind continues to function, who we are as persons remains intact, regardless of what happens to our body.

In contrast, P.F. Strawson argued against Descartes' dualism and saw personhood as essentially embodied. In his essay "Persons," Strawson proposed that our conception of ourselves as persons is tied to both our mental and physical attributes. Our sense of personal identity depends on us having a body and mind that operate together in the world. We experience the world through our bodies, and our mind and thoughts are shaped by our physical form and attributes. For Strawson, a person "would not be what he is if he were not embodied in the way he is." Both mind and body are integral to defining a person.

Finally, Charles Foster proposed that relationships and experiences, not just the mind or body alone, shape personhood. In his essay "The Story of the Self," Foster argues that we construct our identity and sense of self through the stories we tell about ourselves and our life events. These stories are built on and reinforced by our relationships and interactions with other people. We come to know ourselves and shape who we are based on how others see and respond to us. For Foster, personhood emerges through this continual process of storytelling and revising one's life narrative based on relationships and experiences. 

In conclusion, while philosophers have debated various perspectives on what defines a person, a compelling view is that personhood arises from a combination of mind, body, relationships, and experiences. Our mind and consciousness are fundamental to thought and reasoning, yet depend on our physical brain and body. Our body shapes how we sense and interact with the world, yet our mind interprets those interactions. And the stories we tell, and relationships we form, reinforce our identity. A person is a complex, multi-faceted entity, defined by this relationship between mental, physical, narrative, and social attributes that make each of us unique. Overall, there is no single formula for personhood; we are defined by the singular yet deeply interconnected composition of attributes that form the self.
