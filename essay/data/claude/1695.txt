Electronic tourism distribution channels connect tourists and tourism suppliers using information technology and the Internet. There are many different types of electronic distribution channels, and they function in different ways from both the consumer and supplier perspective. The most common channels are online travel agencies, global distribution systems, and supplier direct websites. These channels allow suppliers to market and distribute their products directly to consumers. 

From the consumer perspective, electronic distribution channels offer convenience and choice. Consumers have the ability to search, compare, and book tourism products from the comfort of their home at any time of day. They have access to a wide range of options from different suppliers across the globe. This allows them to find products that suit their needs and budget. Consumers do not need to visit physical travel agencies or supplier offices to make bookings and purchases. Many channels also offer special deals and discounts not available elsewhere. However, the large volume of choices can also be overwhelming and make it difficult for consumers to determine reputable suppliers and trusted channels. 

From the supplier perspective, electronic distribution channels provide opportunities for global reach and reduced costs. Suppliers can promote their products and make them available for purchase by anyone around the world with an Internet connection. This allows small suppliers to access the same enormous potential market as large multinational companies. Electronic channels are also cost-efficient, eliminating expenses associated with physical offices and paper-based marketing materials. However, electronic channels introduce new fees from online travel agencies and global distribution systems. Suppliers often have to pay commissions of up to 25% of the product price. They also face intense competition from other suppliers and lose some control over product information and pricing.

Global distribution systems (GDS) are large reservation networks that allow travel agents and online travel agencies to search and book tourism suppliers’ products. The four major GDS are Amadeus, Sabre, Travelport, and Travelsky. They provide a centralized platform where suppliers can upload information about their products, including descriptions, availability, and rates. The GDS then distribute this information to travel agencies and online travel agencies, who can sell the products to consumers. The key role of GDS is to facilitate business-to-business relationships in the tourism industry. They charge suppliers initial signup and ongoing usage fees for accessing the reservation systems.

Online travel agencies (OTA) operate websites and mobile apps where consumers can search and book tourism products. The leading OTAs are Booking.com, Expedia, and TripAdvisor. They obtain information and rates about suppliers’ products through direct connections with suppliers or GDS. OTAs charge suppliers a commission on all sales made through their channel, typically in the range of 15-25% of the product price. In exchange, OTAs provide suppliers with high-volume distribution and exposure to a wide consumer audience. Many OTAs offer price comparison across different suppliers, allowing consumers to choose the least expensive option.

Travel agents are intermediaries that provide advisory and booking services to consumers. Traditional travel agents operate physical offices, while some are now online travel agents with virtual offices. Travel agents use their knowledge and expertise to match consumers with suitable tourism products based on factors like destination, budget, dates, and interests. They make bookings on consumers’ behalf through GDS, direct supplier connections, or OTAs. Travel agents charge fees directly to consumers, either through a flat transaction fee or built into the total price of tour packages they sell.

In summary, electronic tourism distribution channels greatly benefit both suppliers and consumers. They increase the reach and accessibility of tourism products in a cost-efficient manner. A range of intermediaries connect suppliers and consumers, including global distribution systems, online travel agencies, and travel agents. The future of tourism distribution will likely see further digitization, with more direct-to-consumer channels and personalized trip planning experiences. However, traditional intermediaries will continue functioning by providing advisory services and tour packages. Electronic and traditional distribution models will integrate, offering consumers more options and greater convenience in trip planning and booking experiences.
