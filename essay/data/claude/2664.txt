Standard solutions of sodium fluoride (NaF) and magnesium fluoride (MgF2) were prepared through serial dilution of 0.1M NaF solution and saturated MgF2 solution. To prepare the standard solutions, 0.1M NaF stock solution was  diluted by factors of 10 to obtain solutions with concentrations of 0.01M, 0.001M, and 0.0001M. For MgF2, the saturated stock solution was diluted by factors of 10 to obtain standard solutions with concentrations of 0.1M, 0.01M and 0.001M. 

100mL of each standard solution was measured and analyzed using a fluoride ion selective electrode to determine its fluoride ion concentration based on its electric potential. The electrode was first calibrated using the known standards to establish a correlation between electric potential and fluoride ion concentration. The temperature of the solutions was measured during testing because ion selective electrode potentials are temperature dependent. The calibration and sample solution temperatures were used to standardize the electrode potential to 25Â°C to ensure accurate concentration measurements.

To determine the fluoride concentration of the MgF2 solutions, the known NaF standard solutions were used to calibrate the ion selective electrode. Because the response of the electrode depends on the total fluoride activity, which is a function of both the fluoride ion concentration and its interaction with the solution components, the NaF and MgF2 solutions had to be prepared in solutions with comparable ionic strengths. Thus, the electrode calibration allowed for the determination of fluoride concentrations that accounted for the solution components and interaction effects. 

In summary, through serial dilution of 0.1M NaF and saturated MgF2 solutions, 100mL standard solutions of known concentrations were prepared. An ion selective electrode calibrated with the NaF standards was used to determine the fluoride concentrations of the MgF2 solutions, while accounting for solution temperature and components. This experiment demonstrated the ability to quantify fluoride in solutions with and without NaF using an ion selective electrode.
