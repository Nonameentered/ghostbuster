Graphological Features and Thematic Content in Two Extracts of Dialogic Prose

The two passages of dialogic prose analyzed here—excerpts from James Joyce's Ulysses and Virginia Woolf's Night and Day—both use distinctive graphological features and thematic content focusing on nighttime in urban streets, yet they differ notably in tone and form. 

In the excerpt from Ulysses, Joyce employs dialog without quotation marks, stream of consciousness, and linguistic experimentation to vividly portray the nocturnal urban atmosphere of Dublin and its effects on characters' psychology. The passage opens abruptly with "blooming fruit was made for the sun" (33), lacking context about speaker or setting. As dialogue continues between Leopold Bloom and Stephen Dedalus during their wandering night walk, sentences run on and change subjects frequently through free indirect discourse representing characters' associational thinking. Questions, exclamations, and nonsense phrases like "Eh? What?...Ah, Stephen, have a bit of sense!" (35) give a sense of real spontaneous speech. 

Joyce's chaotic and impressionistic style, with its fractured syntax, compression, and incorporation of ambient sounds like "klax-on horns" and "câble trams" (33-34), mirrors the sensory overload and haphazard rhythms of the nocturnal city. The dark, jumbled streets become a liminal setting for Stephen and Bloom's stream of drunken philosophizing and wandering unconscious thoughts. Phrases like "we feel in England" and "on the continent" (35) indicate characters grappling with ideas of national identity at night when usual social structures break down. Both characters, adrift at night, seek connection, as Bloom invites Stephen to stay at his house. Joyce uses experimental graphological techniques to achieve a potent effect of realism and psychological interiority during nighttime Dublin.

In contrast, Woolf's passage adopts a more traditional omniscient narrative voice and standard syntax to capture another facet of night in London, focusing on Clarissa Dalloway's reflections on youth while looking out her window. The passage has a pensive and elegiac tone rendered through poetic and symbolic language, as opposed to Joyce's chaotic immediacy. "This late age of the world's experience had bred in them...a shared feeling" (25) asserts a connection between Clarissa and Peter Walsh in a way that feels lyrical rather than spontaneous. The omniscient voice peers beneath experiences to find a kind of nocturnal wisdom: "this calm, this relief, this peace...at midnight in London" (25). 
    The darkness outside functions as a canvas over which memories of one's past selves can be painted. Similarly, yet with more stateliness and finesse than Joyce, Woolf uses the urban night to portray psyche and connections transcending time.

Overall, Joyce's passage, rooted in the dialogic immediacy and energy of Dublin nightlife, takes a nocturnal glimpse into the uncensored mind that explodes with thoughts obscurely connected, tracing our psychology's wanderings with experimental abandon. Woolf's looks into London night quietness and solitude, pondering the self's passage through time, pensiveness and wisdom veiled by the nighttime's stillness. Through night, both authors explore the psyche as it realizes and connects across literal and mental spaces, in Dublin's labyrinthine junction of voices and London's lyrical solace of privately realized continuities. In both passages, the darkness and stillness of nighttime city envelops unexpected illuminations of thoughts and connections.
