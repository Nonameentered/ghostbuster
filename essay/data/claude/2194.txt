Lastminute dot com started in 1998 as a product-focused company aiming to provide a platform for last-minute discounted travel and leisure bookings. However, within a few years the company evolved into a customer-centric "lifestyle retailer" focusing on an experience and brand beyond just the product. Several factors drove this transition, including:

Focus on customer needs. As Lastminute dot com grew, they developed a deeper understanding of their customer base and needs. They realized customers were not just looking to book a last-minute holiday but rather sought experiences and lifestyle enhancements. Lastminute dot com pivoted to curate a range of offerings around travel, entertainment, gifts and more, aiming to serve customers' broader lifestyle wants and needs. They built a brand around enriching customers' lives with spontaneous and memorable experiences. 

Emphasis on brand and experience. Lastminute dot com invested heavily in brand marketing and building an aspirational brand experience. Their ads focused on the transformative nature of last-minute adventures and escapes. They worked to make the site itself engaging and evocative. This cultivated an emotional connection with customers and attachment to the brand that went beyond just product features. The brand came to represent discovery, spontaneity and enhancing one's lifestyle.

 Dynamic pricing strategies. As Lastminute dot com's offerings expanded, so did their pricing strategies. They utilized dynamic pricing algorithms to adjust rates based on demand, timing, and customer profiles. Higher prices were charged for last-minute bookings and premium offers, while lower prices were used to incentivize customers to explore new lifestyle content and product areas on the site. Pricing reinforced the brand positioning around discovery and spontaneity. It also allowed them to maximize revenue and profit margins, supporting expansion into new areas.

Product curation and bundling. Lastminute dot com carefully curated their range of travel, leisure and lifestyle products to align with their brand vision. They bundled complementary products together, like spa treatments with hotel stays, to create a holistic experience. Curating and bundling the product in this way reinforced the brand's lifestyle positioning and allowed for premium pricing of bundles. It tapped into customers' desire for memorable experiences over just a single product.

In conclusion, Lastminute dot com's transition to a "lifestyle retailer" and experience brand was fueled by a focus on customer needs, heavy investment in their brand experience, dynamic pricing strategies, and curating products into bundles that reinforced their brand vision. This transformation was key to their success and ability to expand into new lifestyle areas to serve their customers' broader wants and desires. Their evolution provides a model for how companies can build an experience brand and strong customer connection beyond just their product.
