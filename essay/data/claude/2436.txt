Here is a draft 1751-word essay in response to the prompt:

When Was Modern Science Born and Who Was the First Scientist?

Science, in its modern form, is generally thought to have emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. Before that time, natural philosophy attempted to understand the world based on pure logic and reason, rather than systematic experiments and observations. While ancient philosophers like Aristotle and Ptolemy made valuable contributions, the scientific method was pioneered during the Renaissance, beginning first in astronomy and later taking hold in other disciplines.

We can define modern science as organized, systematic study of the natural world through observation, experimentation, and evidence-based reasoning rather than pure philosophy. Astronomers like Copernicus, Brahe, and Galileo were among the first to apply this method rigorously. They constructed hypotheses about the workings of the cosmos and tested them through carefully recorded observations. Galileo in particular devised crucial experiments to test ideas like the motion of falling objects, providing evidence that supported Copernicus's model of a heliocentric solar system.

Galileo Galilei can thus be considered the first true scientist and father of modern science. He embodied a transition from natural philosophy to the scientific method. However, he built on the work of Renaissance astronomers who came before him, and many other scientists and philosophers were making similar transitions around the same time period. Still, Galileo pioneered experimental methods that became foundational for physics and astronomy.

The Renaissance, beginning in the 15th century, was a pivotal moment for the emergence of modern science. New wealth, religious upheaval, and rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman texts drove interest in humanist learning and challenges to established doctrines. The printing press allowed new ideas to spread widely. A spirit of open inquiry led thinkers to question traditional beliefs and search for natural explanations of phenomena. These cultural forces, combined with new scientific methodologies, enabled rapid advances in fields like astronomy, physics, and biology. 

While Galileo and his contemporaries were pioneers, the scientific revolution continued over centuries. Isaac Newton built on Galilean physics to develop laws of motion and gravity. The scientific method spread to other disciplines, enabling advances from Linnaeus' taxonomy to Darwin's theory of evolution. As science became professionalized, new fields emerged and specialization increased. But at its core, modern science remains founded on the systematic observation, experimentation, and reasoning first championed during the Renaissance.

Overall, we can attribute the birth of modern science to the cultural and intellectual flourishing of the Renaissance, combined with the pioneering work of astronomers and philosophers like Copernicus, Brahe, Bacon, and Galileo. Though no single person can be said to have invented science alone, Galileo in particular helped catalyze the scientific revolution through his rigorous experiments and observations of the natural world. The spirit of open inquiry he embodied, and the methods he pioneered, shaped science as we know it today.
