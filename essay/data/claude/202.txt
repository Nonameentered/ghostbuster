The economic slowdown in the United States in 2001 lasted from March through November 2001. It was the first major economic contraction in the U.S. since the recession of 1990-1991. There were several reasons for the economic slowdown in 2001 and its impacts were felt across the global economy:

Reason 1: The bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000 led to a decline in business investment and caused massive losses in the stock market. In the late 1990s, there was a surge in new Internet-based companies, commonly known as dot-coms, that led to a speculative bubble in the stock market, particularly for technology companies. The bubble burst in 2000, leading many dot-coms to go out of business and causing the stock market to decline sharply. The NASDAQ index fell 78% from its peak in March 2000 to its low in October 2002. This decline in the stock market and failure of many dot-coms caused a major drop in business investment and had ripple effects across the economy.  

Reason 2: Interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve led to a slowdown in consumer spending. To curb inflationary pressures in the late 1990s, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates six times between June 1999 and May 2000. Higher interest rates made it more expensive for consumers to borrow money to finance major purchases like homes and cars. This caused consumer spending and demand to slow down, negatively impacting economic growth.

Reason 3: The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks exacerbated the existing economic slowdown. The attacks caused severe disruptions to air travel and tourism, which impacted industries like airlines, hotels, and retail. It also led to a drop in consumer confidence that caused people to cut back on spending. The slowing economy and drop in stock prices had already weakened business investment, and the attacks amplified these trends.  

The economic slowdown in the U.S. had significant impacts on the global economy. As the world's largest economy, a slowdown in the U.S. led to a decline in demand for exports from other countries. Global trade slowed, and major economies in Europe and Asia also saw declining growth rates. The economic slump lasted for eight months in the U.S. before a recovery began in November 2001, aided by interest rate cuts and tax rebates for consumers. But the impacts on business confidence and global trade lasted for several years. Overall, the recession of 2001 provides a glimpse into how interconnected the global economy had become by the early 21st century.
