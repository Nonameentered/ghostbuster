The World Trade Organization's dispute settlement procedure aims to resolve trade conflicts between member nations in a structured and consistent manner. The case of the United States and European Community's dispute over biotech products illustrates how this process works in practice. 

The first step in the WTO dispute settlement process is consultations. When a member believes another member has violated WTO rules, it can request consultations to discuss the issue. In the biotech dispute, the U.S. requested consultations with the EC in 2003 regarding the EC's moratorium on approving biotech products. The parties entered into consultations but were unable to resolve the dispute.

The next stage is the establishment of a dispute settlement panel. If consultations fail, the complaining party can request that a panel be formed to adjudicate the dispute. The U.S. requested a panel in 2003 regarding the EC's moratorium. The panel was established in 2004. Under WTO rules, panel requests should be granted automatically unless there are exceptional circumstances.

The panel will then conduct an objective assessment of the dispute. It will determine whether the challenged measures are inconsistent with WTO obligations and whether they nullify or impair benefits accruing to the complaining party. The panel issued its report in 2006, finding that the EC's moratorium was inconsistent with the EC's obligations under the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and the Technical Barriers to Trade Agreement. 

If a party disagrees with the panel's report, it can appeal to the Appellate Body. An appeal can only be made on issues of law and legal interpretation. In 2007, the EC appealed certain findings of the panel report. The Appellate Body issued its report upholding the panel's finding that the moratorium breached WTO rules.

The disputing parties are obligated to comply with the panel and Appellate Body's reports. They must inform the Dispute Settlement Body of their compliance actions. If a party fails to comply, the complainant can request negotiations for compensation, or as a last resort, ask for authorization to retaliate by suspending WTO concessions. In this case, the EC had until 2007 to lift its moratorium in accordance with the WTO rulings. Failure to do so would allow the U.S. to impose countermeasures.

In summary, the WTO dispute settlement process provides a structured procedure for resolving trade disputes between members. Key stages include consultations, establishment of panels, panel and potential Appellate Body proceedings, and compliance with rulings. The system aims to enforce WTO rules in an objective manner while giving parties opportunities to defend their interests. In the biotech dispute, this process resulted in findings that the EC's moratorium breached its WTO obligations.
