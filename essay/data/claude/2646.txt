The diazonium coupling reaction is an electrophilic aromatic substitution that forms an azo dye between an aromatic amine and a phenol. The first step is to synthesize a diazonium salt from an aromatic amine by reacting it with sodium nitrite and hydrochloric acid. For example, aniline can be converted to benzenediazonium chloride salt. Precautions to take during preparation of diazonium salt:

-   Ensure mixing and cooling is carried out slowly to avoid overheating which can trigger explosion.
-   Use 1:1 concentrated HCl and do not heat reaction beyond 0°C.
-   Keep all materials cold as overheating can lead to explosion. 

Next, to carry out the coupling reaction, the diazonium salt solution is added dropwise to an alkaline solution of phenol. The precautions to take are:

-   Keep all reagents and solutions as cold as possible as overheating can trigger explosion. 
-   Add diazonium salt solution slowly dropwise while stirring to avoid excess heat generation. 
-   Maintain ice-cooling, temperature should not exceed 0°C.

The reaction mechanism involves three steps:

1. Loss of a N2 molecule from the diazonium salt to generate a highly reactive diazonium ion. 

2. The diazonium ion acts as an electrophile and is attracted to the phenolate ion which is the nucleophile. This forms an intermediate species with one carbon-nitrogen bond.

3. Loss of H+ ion from the intermediate to generate the azo dye product with a N=N double bond along with water as a byproduct. 

In summary, the diazonium coupling reaction requires handling reagents carefully with cooling to avoid overheating. When carried out properly following the precautions, it allows the synthesis of a variety of bright azo dyes by coupling diazonium salts with phenols and other aromatic compounds with activated hydrogens. The reaction proceeds via an electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism involving diazonium ion as the electrophile and phenolate ion as the nucleophile.
