Here is a 737-word essay in response to the prompt:

Self-conscious emotions such as embarrassment, shame, and guilt are closely related but also distinct emotions. They share some similarities but also differ in key ways. All three emotions are linked to our concerns about social acceptance and relationships. 

Embarrassment arises from the perception that we have violated a social norm or expectation, usually in a small or temporary way. We feel embarrassed when we trip in public, call someone the wrong name, or are the center of unwanted attention. Embarrassment is a fleeting emotion and does not reflect on our core self or identity. We can feel embarrassed in front of strangers or acquaintances, but the sting is less compared to people we care about. The main purpose of embarrassment seems to be to motivate us to take corrective action, apologize, or restore harmony in the social interaction.

Shame is a more painful emotion that relates to perceived failure or inadequacy of the self. We feel shame when we violate moral norms or do not live up to important social or cultural values. Shame reflects a negative judgment of oneself, not just of one's temporary actions. The painful feeling of shame motivates us to hide or withdraw from social contact. We are more prone to feelings of shame in front of close others whose opinions deeply matter to us. Shame can be a useful emotion in promoting moral development and social order but in excess can lead to damaging self-judgment and social withdrawal.

Guilt also arises from violations of moral and social norms but differs from shame in important ways. With guilt, the focus is on one's actions rather than self-judgment. Guilt promotes an apologetic stance and motivation to make amends in order to restore relationships. Guilt acknowledges that one's actions were wrong while still maintaining a sense of self-worth. As with embarrassment, the experience of guilt helps to smooth social interactions and promote cooperative relationships. Guilt may lead to constructive behaviors such as apologizing, confessing, and resolving to do better in the future.

In summary, self-conscious emotions arise from our strong need for social acceptance and harmony within relationships. Embarrassment, shame, and guilt are closely linked but differ in their implications for self-worth and identity as well as the behaviors they motivate. All three emotions serve important social functions but when disproportionate or misplaced can be problematic. Finding the right balance of self-conscious emotions helps us to monitor social norms while maintaining a healthy self-concept and mutually supportive relationships.
