Determining the saturation vapour pressure (SVP) of water over a temperature range of 268.2K to 313.2K can be accomplished using several methods, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The most accurate method is to use published reference data that has been empirically measured in experiments. However, reference data tables may not always be available or convenient to use. Analytical formulae derived from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation provide a theoretical method to calculate SVP, but introduce uncertainty from the parameters used. Overall, for the specified temperature range, using reference data from empirical measurements is the most reliable method for determining the SVP of water.

Empirically measured reference data provides the most accurate values for determining the SVP of water in the temperature range of interest. Experiments can directly measure the pressure of water vapour in equilibrium with its liquid phase at a given temperature. Multiple experiments are conducted over a range of temperatures to build up a robust data set. These measured values account for molecular interactions and bonding energies in the actual water system, providing an accurate representation of how temperature affects vapour pressure. While reference data may be limited to certain temperatures and pressures, modern databases provide high resolution SVP data for water spanning its stable liquid range and beyond.

In contrast, formulae derived from the Clausius-Clapeyron equation provide only a theoretical estimate of SVP based on certain assumptions. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation uses a linear relationship between the temperature and log of pressure to approximate the SVP curve. However, this equation relies on parameters for the enthalpy of vaporization and specific volume of the vapour that introduce uncertainty. These parameter values vary based on the estimation method and data used. As a result, Clausius-Clapeyron calculations can deviate from measured values, especially at extremes of temperature and pressure. For determining the SVP of water in the given range, this approach would provide lower accuracy than using reference experimental data.

In summary, for finding the saturation vapour pressure of water between 268.2K and 313.2K, using direct experimental reference data is the preferred method. Measured values provide an accurate representation of the relationship between temperature and SVP for the actual water system. In contrast, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation and associated formulae rely on theoretical parameters that introduce uncertainty and can deviate from empirical measurements, especially at temperature extremes. When available, experimentally measured reference data tables give the most reliable SVP values for water over the specified range.
