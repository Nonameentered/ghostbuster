The Heckscher-Ohlin model of international trade is an economic theory developed by Eli Heckscher and Bertil Ohlin that explains how patterns of international trade are determined by the relative abundance of capital and labor in different countries. The key assumption of the model is that countries will export goods that require inputs that they have in relative abundance, and import goods that require inputs that are in relative scarcity. 

The Heckscher-Ohlin model makes several key assumptions. First, it assumes that there are two countries, two goods, and two factors of production (capital and labor). It also assumes that the two goods require different proportions of capital and labor, so they are produced with different factor intensities. Additionally, the model assumes that the two countries have different relative factor endowments of capital and labor. Finally, the model assumes that there are constant returns to scale in production, and that the factors of production are perfectly mobile within countries but immobile between countries.

Based on these assumptions, the Heckscher-Ohlin model predicts that countries will export the good that intensively uses the factor of production that is in relative abundance. At the same time, they will import the good that intensively uses the factor of production that is in relative scarcity. This is because the country will have a comparative advantage in producing the good that uses its relatively abundant factor more intensively. Trade based on comparative advantage will benefit both countries, as they can focus on what they are relatively most efficient at producing.

The Heckscher-Ohlin model provides important insights into how patterns of international trade develop and the implications for government policies. Governments will often implement policies to protect industries that use factors of production that are in abundance in that country. For example, a capital-abundant country may protect or subsidize capital-intensive industries, while a labor-abundant country may protect labor-intensive industries. The model also suggests that international trade may exacerbate existing factor price inequalities in an economy.

In conclusion, the Heckscher-Ohlin model provides a powerful explanation for how comparative advantage arises from differences in factor endowments across countries. The model's assumptions simplify the real world but yield important insights into trade policies that governments implement to support industries intensive in factors that are domestically abundant. Overall, the Heckscher-Ohlin model remains highly relevant for understanding international trade patterns and government policymaking today.
