Communication is essential within any organization, but it is particularly crucial for large companies with many employees spread across multiple locations. Effective communication ensures that important messages reach all necessary individuals and teams in a timely manner. It also helps build relationships and trust between colleagues, leading to more cooperation and collaboration.  

For a major pharmaceutical company like AstraZeneca, which has over 70,000 employees working in different countries, communication is imperative for success. The key reasons why effective communication is so important within AstraZeneca include:

Information sharing. With various research, manufacturing, and marketing teams around the world, communicating updates and discoveries is vital. New breakthroughs or product safety concerns need to be swiftly conveyed to all relevant groups so that key decisions can be made and implementations can proceed rapidly. Regular communication channels for information sharing, such as newsletters, intranets, and video updates help keep the flow of information constant across such a large organization.

Alignment and cohesion. Effective communication helps align employees around key priorities and goals, building a shared sense of purpose. This cohesion is necessary for AstraZeneca to function optimally as one company rather than siloed business units or regional outposts. Communicating the overarching company vision and strategy, highlighting examples of successful cross-functional collaboration, and facilitating interaction between geographically separated teams all help strengthen organizational alignment. 

Relationship building. Productive working relationships depend on open communication. Within a company like AstraZeneca, communication is required both vertically between management and employees as well as horizontally between co-workers and cross-functional teams. Frequent communication through meetings, calls, emails, and employee networking events help build familiarity, trust, and camaraderie between colleagues who may never meet in person. These connections enable teams to work better together during critical projects.

Meetings are an important forum for communication within large companies, and their success depends on effective communication skills. Three keys to conducting a successful meeting at AstraZeneca are preparation, facilitation, and follow-up:

Preparation: Distribute relevant material in advance. Share a timed agenda and clear objectives. This allows attendees to prepare questions and be ready to actively contribute during the meeting. Starting with context and background also helps get everyone on the same page, especially for cross-cultural or cross-functional groups.
