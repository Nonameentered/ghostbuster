Monocrystalline and amorphous photovoltaic cells have differing structures and performance characteristics that would affect a photovoltaic system design in Reading. Monocrystalline cells are made from a single silicon crystal grown into ingots and sliced into wafers. They have a uniform and rigid structure that enables high efficiency, typically 15-20%. Amorphous cells have a non-uniform random network of silicon atoms deposited onto a substrate. They have lower efficiency around 6-8% due to increased defects and imperfections but can be produced more cheaply.  

In a system design in Reading with significant shading, amorphous cells may be more effective as they produce more uniform power under variable or low light conditions. Their intrinsic low light sensitivities combined with the self-shading effects of the random cell structure allow them to operate with less loss in efficiency under shading. Monocrystalline cells suffer a more significant drop in power from shading due to the strict orientation requirements of the cell structure. Solutions to reduce performance impacts include installing light sensors to track shading coverage, using microinverters for panel-level MPPT, or employing optimization algorithms to reconfigure strings and maximize total power.

PVSyst and RETScreen offer useful but different capabilities for photovoltaic system simulation and analysis. PVSyst is a powerful simulation tool meant for precise modeling of complex systems. It enables input of extensive weather data sets, choosing from many pre-defined components or entering customized elements, and running long-term performance simulations with financial metrics. However, it requires significant expertise to build an accurate model and interpret results. RETScreen is a more basic and user-friendly tool meant for initial feasibility assessment and comparison of system concepts. It has more simplified assumptions and generic data inputs but can quickly estimate performance, costs and savings to determine if a project concept deserves further analysis using a program like PVSyst.  

In summary, monocrystalline and amorphous cells would have different strengths and weaknesses in a Reading photovoltaic system design with heavy shading. Monocrystalline cells provide higher efficiency but suffer more significant performance losses from shading, while amorphous cells have lower but more uniform and shading-tolerant power output. Programs like PVSyst and RETScreen approach photovoltaic system simulation and analysis with different levels of complexity to match a project's needs at various stages of development. Using both tools on a single project can enable a informative yet quick initial assessment, followed by detailed performance modeling and optimization. With the diverse characteristics of photovoltaic technologies and design tools, determining the most suitable solution for a project's unique requirements is key to maximizing its energy and financial performance.
