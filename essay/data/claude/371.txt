In their 2005 research, Gee, Coventry and Birkenhead investigated the relationship between mood state and gambling behavior using a quasi-experimental design. Their main findings were that participants in a negative mood state gambled significantly more and made riskier choices than those in a positive mood state. However, there are several advantages and disadvantages of their quasi-experimental approach, especially regarding internal validity, external validity, construct validity and reliability.

A key advantage of the quasi-experiment is its high external validity compared to a tightly controlled laboratory experiment. The study was conducted in a real casino environment with actual gamblers, increasing the ecological validity of the findings. However, this comes at the cost of lower internal validity due to the lack of randomization and control. The researchers could not manipulate mood directly nor randomly assign participants to conditions. The groups may have differed on other variables that influenced the results. For example, the negative mood group may have contained more regular gamblers, biasing the results.

Another advantage is the unobtrusive measurement of the independent variable (mood) and dependent variable (gambling behavior). However, this threatens the construct validity of the measures. The researchers relied on a single self-report item to measure mood, which may not have accurately captured the construct. More objective measures of mood and gambling behavior are needed to strengthen construct validity. Reliability is also uncertain given the single-item measures.  

To improve the study, the researchers could strengthen internal validity by directly manipulating mood, e.g. using music, film clips or autobiographical recall. Participants could then be randomly assigned to mood conditions. Construct validity and reliability can be improved with multi-item validated scales to measure mood and gambling behavior. The researchers could also control for potential confounds like gambling frequency.

In summary, while Gee et al.â€™s quasi-experiment benefits from high ecological validity, there are several limitations relating to internal validity, construct validity and reliability. Direct manipulation of mood, randomization, validated measures and controlling for confounds may help address these limitations in future research. Overall, the study provides suggestive evidence that negative mood increases gambling behavior, but more rigorously designed experiments are needed to draw firm conclusions.
