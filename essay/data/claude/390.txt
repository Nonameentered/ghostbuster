Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the joints and other tissues. It is characterized by pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints that can lead to joint damage and disability over time if left untreated. The clinical evidence clearly shows that RA causes significant morbidity and reduced quality of life.

Multiple studies have found that the incidence of RA ranges from 0.5 to 1% of the population, with a higher prevalence in women and older adults. The disease process of RA involves the immune system attacking the synovium, the soft tissue in the joints. This leads to inflammation that causes swelling, pain, and stiffness. If untreated, the inflammation can damage cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and ultimately bone. 

The most common symptoms of RA include pain, tenderness, and swelling in multiple joints, especially the hands and feet. Morning stiffness that lasts for more than 30 minutes is also a frequent complaint. Some patients experience more systemic symptoms like fatigue, low-grade fever, and weight loss. The specific joints affected and the severity of symptoms can vary from person to person.

In addition to joint problems, people with RA often develop comorbidities that further impact their health. Anemia or low red blood cell count is common, as is osteoporosis which can lead to bone fractures. RA also increases the risk of heart disease and lymphoma. Due to pain, disability, and other health issues, many patients experience depression and anxiety as well.

In summary, rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by significant joint inflammation, damage, and disability. It causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints and frequently leads to comorbid conditions that reduce both quality of life and life expectancy. With ongoing research and new treatments, the prognosis for people with RA has improved, but more work still needs to be done to find a cure and help patients manage symptoms and slow the progression of joint damage.
