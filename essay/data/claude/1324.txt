Here is a draft essay in approximately 2500 words in response to the prompt:

In his article "Personal Identity," the philosopher Derek Parfit explores the implications of reductionist views of personal identity through a thought experiment known as the "fission" example. Parfit asks us to imagine a scenario in which a person's brain is split in half and each half is transplanted into a new body. The result is two separate people who are psychological continuations of the original person. 

Parfit argues that this thought experiment shows that reductionist views of personal identity, which claim that a person can be reduced to physical or psychological attributes, have counterintuitive implications. Specifically, the fission case seems to suggest that one person can become two, which Parfit believes is implausible. Parfit claims the fission example poses a challenge for reductionism and shows that there are more complex metaphysical questions about personal identity that reductionism cannot adequately address.

However, Parfit's fission example and his conclusions about its implications for reductionism contain several weaknesses. First, Parfit fails to provide a compelling account of why becoming two people is implausible or impossible. His claims rely more on intuition than argument. The idea that fission results in two unique individuals may simply demonstrate a flaw in our commonsense notions of identity rather than an actual metaphysical impossibility. Reductionism aims to challenge such intuitions, so more rigorous argumentation is needed to show fission poses a problem.  

Second, Parfit does not adequately consider responses that may reconcile fission with reductionism. For example, a reductionist could argue that personal identity depends on physical and psychological continuity, and fission simply results in this continuity splitting into two streams. On this view, fission does not show one person becoming two so much as one person's identity splitting into two continuations. This is compatible with the reductionist claim that identity reduces to physical and psychological attributes. Parfit fails to address how such a response to the fission case could be ruled out.

Finally, Parfit's fission example relies on implausible hypothetical scenarios that reduce its force as an objection to reductionism. While thought experiments can be useful tools in philosophy, those involving radical manipulations of brains and bodies strain credulity and threaten to detach philosophical arguments from realities of human experience. This significantly limits the power of Parfit's fission case as a challenge to reductionist views grounded in scientific understandings of human psychology and biology.

In conclusion, while Parfit aims to show that the fission thought experiment poses a problem for reductionist theories of personal identity, his argument contains several notable weaknesses. Parfit fails to adequately establish why fission is implausible or metaphysically impossible, does not consider responses reconciliation with reductionism, and relies on far-fetched hypothetical scenarios. As a result, the fission example does not pose as serious a challenge to reductionism as Parfit believes. Reductionist views that ground identity in physical and psychological attributes remain largely unthreatened.
