Dirichlet's theorem states that any function defined on an interval can be represented by a trigonometric Fourier series if and only if the function is periodic and integrable over one period. This theorem is fundamental for the study of trigonometric series as it provides the precise conditions under which a function can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a trigonometric series.

For a function to be represented by a trigonometric series, it must first be periodic, meaning it repeats itself over a fixed interval. The trigonometric series can then represent the function over one period and extend that representation to the entire domain. Second, the function must be integrable over one period, meaning its area or integral over one period is finite. This condition ensures that the trigonometric series does not require an infinite number of terms to represent the function. 

If a function meets these two conditions according to Dirichlet's theorem, then it can be represented by a trigonometric series. The trigonometric series provides a approximation that can be made as accurate as needed by including more terms. This is a powerful result as it provides a systematic way to represent a vast array of functions.

The significance of Dirichlet's theorem is that it precisely characterizes those functions that can be represented by trigonometric Fourier series. By determining which conditions a function must meet, it establishes a foundation for the theory and application of trigonometric series. With this understanding, trigonometric series have become essential for many applications in engineering, physics, signal processing, and more. Overall, Dirichlet's simple but profound theorem unlocked the huge potential of trigonometric series.
