Here is a draft 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

The Wisdom of Solomon is one of the deuterocanonical books of the Bible, meaning it is canonical for some Christian faiths but not for Jews or Protestants. This text likely dates to the late first or early second century BCE. The writer of Wisdom portrays God as an eternal, all-powerful, and just source of wisdom who rewards righteousness and punishes the wicked. For the author, piety means worshipping the one true God, following His laws, and rejecting idolatry. The text also draws on Greek and Egyptian influences in articulating its theology and philosophy.

The portrait of God in Wisdom is consistent with other Jewish writings of the Second Temple Period. God is the all-powerful creator who established the natural and moral order of the universe. As Wisdom 1:7 states, "The Spirit of the Lord fills the world" and sustains all of creation. God is also just, hating wickedness and rewarding virtue. Those who reject God and practice injustice will face punishment, while the righteous who worship God will receive eternal life, as Wisdom 3 makes clear.

For the writer, piety means following the teachings of the Jewish faith and rejecting paganism. Wisdom harshly condemns the worship of idols as "senseless" and idolaters as "fools" (Wisdom 13-15). Piety instead means revering the one true God, following His laws, and leading a virtuous life. As Wisdom 6:18 instructs, "Love of wisdom is observance of her laws." The truly pious pursue righteousness, justice, and virtue. They exhibit reverence for God through obedience to His will.

The text constructs a distinctly Jewish identity, setting it against Egyptian and Greek cultural influences. References to events from Israelite history, like the Exodus, establish the text's Jewish provenance. Harsh polemics against idolatry affirm its monotheistic message. At the same time, the text adopts some Greek philosophical ideas, like the belief in the immortal soul, and an Egyptian metaphor of life as a river's journey to explain the afterlife of the righteous and wicked. The cultural context points to Alexandria, with its fusion of Jewish, Greek and Egyptian traditions, as a probable place of composition.

In summary, the Wisdom of Solomon provides insight into Jewish theology, ethics and identity in the Second Temple Period. God is portrayed as the wise, all-powerful and just creator and sustainer of the universe who demands reverence and obedience. Piety means worshipping the one true God alone, following His teachings, and rejecting idolatry. While affirming a distinctly Jewish identity, the text also synthesizes Greek and Egyptian cultural influences, suggesting it was written in a place like Alexandria. The Wisdom of Solomon offers a glimpse into how some Jews understood their relationship with God, defined virtue, and navigated outside cultures during this era.
