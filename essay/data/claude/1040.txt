The "knowledge argument" put forth by Frank Jackson in response to physicalism is the argument that there are non-physical properties, specifically qualia or the subjective experiences of consciousness, that cannot be fully captured by a purely physical account of the world. Jackson illustrates this argument using two thought experiments involving characters named Mary and Fred.  

Mary is a brilliant neuroscientist who has been raised in a black and white room and has never experienced color. Though she has learned everything there is to know about the physical nature of color and color perception, Jackson argues that there is still something Mary is missing - the qualitative experience of color. When Mary is released from her room and sees a red rose for the first time, she learns something new - what it is like to experience the color red. This shows there are non-physical qualities, qualia, that cannot be captured in a purely physical description.

The character Fred has an inverted spectrum - he sees green when he looks at red objects and vice versa. Though Fred and a normal person may be physically and functionally indistinguishable, there is something different about their experiences - one sees red and green, the other green and red. This again illustrates there is an aspect of mind that is non-physical. Physical facts alone cannot determine what color qualia a person experiences. 

Nagel puts forth a similar anti-physicalist argument but focuses more on the subjective character of experience rather than qualia like color experiences. He argues that there is something that is like to be a bat, or any conscious being, that we as humans will never fully understand through objective, physical descriptions. There is an irreducibly subjective aspect of consciousness that cannot be captured from an outside perspective. We can describe the physical mechanisms of echolocation in bats, but we do not know what it feels like as a lived experience. Both Jackson and Nagel argue against a purely objective, physical account of the mind, but come at the issue from slightly different angles regarding qualia and subjectivity.

Daniel Dennett offers a criticism of the idea of qualia and argues that philosophical thought experiments like those put forth by Jackson do not constitute evidence against physicalism. Dennett denies there are any ineffable, intrinsic qualities of experience like qualia. Rather, he sees experience as involving an interaction between implicit judgments and interpretations on the part of subjects. From this perspective, Mary may feel that she learns something new upon seeing color for the first time, but this is a kind of illusion based on her implicit beliefs and expectations. Dennett argues that a fuller understanding of the physical mechanisms underlying consciousness and perception will ultimately dissolve what seem to be mysteries about experience, like qualia, at present.

In summary, the knowledge argument put forth by Jackson aims to demonstrate that physicalism cannot fully account for certain aspects of conscious experience, like qualia. Nagel articulates a similar anti-physicalist argument that focuses on the essential subjectivity of experience that cannot be captured objectively. However, Dennett offers a physicalist-friendly critique of the idea of qualia and argues that philosophical thought experiments about knowledge and experience do not actually threaten physicalism. The debate around these issues remains open and deeply contested in philosophy of mind and cognitive science.
