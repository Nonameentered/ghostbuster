Here is a 1000 word essay in response to the prompt:

The political situations in Eastern European countries were diverse in the aftermath of World War II. Some countries were occupied by the Soviet Union, while others still maintained a degree of political independence. The Western powers, especially the United States, aimed to check Soviet power and influence in the region through political and economic means. However, the Soviet Union was determined to dominate Eastern Europe, and eventually most countries came under the control of communist governments aligned with Moscow. 

Several factors allowed the Soviet Union to communize Eastern Europe. First, the Soviet Red Army occupied much of Eastern Europe at the end of World War II, including countries like Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. The Soviet military presence enabled the Kremlin to directly shape political outcomes in these countries. The Soviets ensured that communist politicians and parties came to power, often dominating or suppressing other political groups.  

Second, the Soviet Union capitalized on postwar conditions to strengthen communist forces. Many Eastern European economies were in disarray after the war, and communist promises of economic relief and redistribution of wealth and property resonated with some segments of the population. The Soviets also portrayed themselves as the liberators of Eastern Europe from Nazi rule, hoping to win popular support. They attempted to smear non-communist politicians as fascists and collaborators.

Third, the Western powers were limited in their ability to counter Soviet ambitions. Militarily, the Western Allies demobilized quickly after the war and were in no position to challenge the Soviet forces occupying Eastern Europe. Politically and economically, the West launched initiatives like the Marshall Plan to help Western European countries rebuild and resist Soviet influence. However, the Soviets forbade Eastern European participation in such programs. The West also held out hope that Moscow would honor promises to allow free elections in occupied areas - hopes that were ultimately disappointed.

In conclusion, a combination of Soviet military power, political opportunism, and Western constraints allowed the Soviet Union to establish communist control over most of Eastern Europe in the aftermath of World War II. The diverse political futures of Eastern Europe were gradually eclipsed by the reality of Soviet dominance and the descent of the "Iron Curtain."
