The first 50 words a child learns to speak are profoundly significant in their language development and cognitive growth. These initial word acquisitions pave the way for learning grammar, scaffolding more complex ideas, and engaging in symbolic thinking. In contrast, chimpanzees that have acquired human sign language, while demonstrating some linguistic abilities, have clear limitations compared to human children, even at this early stage. 

A child's first words usually emerge around their first birthday, marking an important transition from infancy into early childhood. These first words are often mama, dada, bottle, baby, dog, ballâ€”concrete nouns that reflect frequent interactions or important people and objects in a baby's immediate world. At first, a baby will mimic the sounds and physical gestures of words, connecting them to the real-world objects and events. With repetition, the child starts to grasp that these verbal symbols can be used to represent and acquire things. This shows the beginnings of symbolic or representational thinking that will blossom over the next several years.

The one-word stage is followed quickly by two- and three-word combinations that demonstrate proto-grammar and syntax. A child might say "daddy bye-bye" or "me cookie more." These small phrases convey relationships between words and simple ideas. By 18-24 months, most children have acquired around 50 words and short phrases, and vocabulary acquisition accelerates rapidly. Studies show the number of words a child knows at age 2 is predictive of language and literacy abilities at ages 9 and 10, highlighting how foundational this early period is.

In contrast, chimpanzees taught human sign language, while capable of learning and using hundreds of signs, do not show evidence of the same cognitive progression or symbolic capacity as human children. They cannot combine signs into novel constructions that demonstrate grammatical rules or syntax. Their communications tend to focus on requests relating to food, play, and grooming, rather than more abstract or imaginary ideas. While chimps in language studies performed complex problem-solving and formed close bonds with their human teachers, their sign language abilities remained highly context-dependent and did not support recursive or metaphorical language as in humans.

In conclusion, a human child's first 50 words provide a window into the rapid growth of language and cognition in early childhood. These initial word acquisitions jumpstart a developmental process that, even in its earliest stages, outstrips the linguistic capabilities of our closest biological relatives. The one- and two-word combinations a toddler produces paves the path to learning grammar and symbolic thinking, demonstrating how language alone can transform a child's mental life and bring them into human culture. Overall, the significance of the first 50 words underscores what makes human thought unique.
