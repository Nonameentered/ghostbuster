T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land is a seminal modernist poem that challenges traditional notions of meaning, identity, and cultural authority. Applying the lens of New Historicism and Cultural Materialism allows us to understand how Eliot's poem subverts hegemonic cultural forms and destabilizes dominant views of identity through its innovative and fragmentary use of language. 

Cultural Materialism is a critical approach focused on analyzing texts within their broader historical and material contexts. Practitioners argue that culture, politics, economics, and society all shape art and literature. By examining Eliot's time period of the early 20th century, we see the massive disruptions of World War I, the loss of religious faith, and the beginnings of cosmopolitanism in London all contributing to a sense of meaninglessness and rootlessness. The Waste Land reflects this through its lack of coherence and fragmented pastiche of various cultures, languages, and literary allusions.

The poem rejects traditional poetic forms and coherent meaning, subverting the hegemony of ordered logic and artistic unity. It is a decidedly nonlinear and obscure text that reflects the period's anxieties over losing central cultural anchors. The various sections—"The Burial of the Dead," "A Game of Chess," "The Fire Sermon," "Death by Water," and "What the Thunder Said"—do not follow a clear narrative or thematic logic. Rather, the poem relies on free associative links and juxtapositions to generate meaning, without a central coherent message. 

This rejection of ordered meaning also reflects the loss of dominant ideologies around religion, politics, and identity in the modernist period. For example, the line "These fragments I have shored against my ruins" suggests the poem itself is a fragmented collection of cultural ruins, a metaphor for spiritual and civilizational ruin. References to the Fisher King, Eastern religions, Western Christianity, Shakespeare, and more all juxtapose various belief systems without privileging any single one, reflecting a postmodern packing together of cultural signifiers emptied of meaning.

The poem also destabilizes identity by using a multi-vocal, pastiche-driven form. There is no single speaker or voice, no consistent "I" in the poem one can attribute as Eliot's own or a character's. Instead, myriad voices and registers come together, as in the linguistic chaos of the pub scene where Cockney slang is jammed against literary references. As cultural concepts of religion, politics, and logic were breaking down, so too was a belief in a unified self or identity. The poem reflects this in its rejection of a single voice in favor of heteroglossia and bricolage.

In conclusion, by applying the lens of Cultural Materialism we can understand how in The Waste Land, Eliot shattered poetic conventions and rejected dominant ideologies and concepts of meaning and identity. The poem's fragmented form, heteroglossic voices, and pastiche of cultural references subverted hegemonic forms of logic, hierarchy, and unity, reflecting the broader postwar experience of meaninglessness and rootlessness. In this way, the poem provides a window into the prevailing anxieties of modernity in the 1920s.
