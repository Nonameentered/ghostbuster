Here is a 500-word essay in response to the prompt:

Language play refers to creative uses of language for enjoyment, experimentation, and humorous effect. Several  characteristics define language play, including phonetic manipulation, semantic artfulness, and structural creativity. 

On the phonetic level, language play often involves rhyme, alliteration, and rhythmic patterning. The repetition of similar or identical sounds creates a musical effect that many find pleasurable or amusing. For example, tongue twisters rely entirely on difficult phonetic sequences to create their effect.

Semantically, language play frequently bends or manipulates the meanings and logic of words and phrases in creative ways. Puns, malapropisms, oxymorons, and nonsense words are examples of semantic play that twist or make light of the standard meanings of language. Sophisticated examples may require cultural context or wit to interpret, while more basic ones have an immediate slapstick comedy effect.

Structurally, language play also experiments with the rules of language, rearranging grammar, syntax, and morphology in innovative ways. Anagrams, palindromes, and disrupted syntax are common types of structural play. The constrained form of the limerick, with its strict meter and rhyme scheme, is another example where the ingenious arrangement of words within a tight structure constitutes the essence of the play.

The limerick incorporates all these characteristics of language play. Its five lines and aabba rhyme scheme represent a structured poetic form. It often relies on nonsense or humorous meanings, and makes use of puns or nonsensical logic. And it frequently incorporates alliteration, assonance, and rhythmic effects. Consider this well-known example:

There once was a man from Nantucket  
Whose ear was swollen and stuck it  
His dad used a pin           
To let the water in
And now Nantucket's just wind and fuck it

With its absurd image, manipulation of logic, rhyme and rhythm, this limerick embraces the essence of creative, nonsensical language play in a highly structured form. In these ways, the limerick demonstrates all the hallmarks of language play.
