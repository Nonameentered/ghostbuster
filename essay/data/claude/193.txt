Acute limb ischaemia refers to an abrupt decrease in blood flow to an extremity, most commonly the legs. It is a medical emergency that requires urgent diagnosis and management to prevent limb loss. There are several potential causes of acute limb ischaemia that can lead to occlusion of arteries and reduce blood flow. 

The most common cause is thromboembolism, which refers to a blood clot that develops in one location and then breaks off and travels to obstruct another blood vessel. Deep vein thrombosis can lead to thromboembolic events that occlude arteries in the leg. Atrial fibrillation can also increase the risk of thromboembolism to the lower limbs. Atherosclerosis causes hardening and narrowing of the arteries, and plaque buildup can rupture and form clots that then block downstream arteries.

Other potential causes include thromboangiitis obliterans, also known as Buerger's disease, which causes inflammation and clots in small and medium arteries. Popliteal aneurysms form ballooning in the popliteal artery behind the knee and can rupture or dissect and occlude blood flow. Low blood flow state or vasospasm can also rarely lead to acute limb ischaemia. Trauma that severs or damages arteries can immediately cut off blood supply to a limb.

The management of acute limb ischaemia involves both medical interventions to restore blood flow as well as anticoagulation to prevent further thromboembolic events. Catheter-directed thrombolysis injects clot-busting drugs directly into the artery to dissolve the clot and restore perfusion. Thrombectomy uses catheters to physically remove the clot. Bypass surgery grafts a vein to route blood flow around the occlusion. Amputation of the limb may be necessary if tissue death has already occurred before treatment.

Long-term anticoagulation, often with warfarin, is typically indicated for patients who have had an acute thromboembolic event to prevent recurrence. The benefits of reducing future clots and ischemia have to be weighed against the risks of potentially serious bleeding events, especially intracranial hemorrhage. The decision on appropriate anticoagulation therapy depends on the underlying cause of the acute ischemia, the risk factors for bleeding, and the patient's overall health and expected compliance. Patient education on the importance of medication adherence and signs/symptoms to monitor is critical. In some cases, antiplatelet therapy may be recommended over full anticoagulation. Close follow-up is needed to evaluate the efficacy of the chosen treatment and make adjustments as necessary.

In summary, acute limb ischemia is a medical emergency with possible severe consequences but also options for treatment and management to restore blood flow and limb viability. Anticoagulation needs to be carefully considered based on the risks and benefits for each individual patient to optimize long-term prevention of recurrence and complications. Close monitoring and patient involvement in the management plan can help reduce morbidity and mortality from this serious condition.
