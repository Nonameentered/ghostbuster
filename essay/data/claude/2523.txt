Here is a 250-word essay in response to the prompt:

The critical approach to literacy in primary schools aims to develop critical thinking abilities and a critical consciousness in children from an early age. Rather than just learning how to read and write, the critical approach teaches children to analyze what they read and write with a questioning and thoughtful mindset. 

Children are encouraged to not just take in information passively but to question the perspectives and biases of authors. They examine who is included or marginalized in texts. They explore the deeper meanings and messages conveyed by words and stories. By adopting this active and analytical stance, children develop skills in critical thinking such as the ability to interpret layers of meaning, assess evidence and arguments, and understand multiple perspectives.

A critical approach also develops a critical consciousness by exposing children to diverse forms of literacy focused on issues of social justice and equality. Children read stories of people from marginalized groups and with life experiences very different from their own. They are prompted to discuss issues of power and privilege. Over time, they become aware of inequalities and biases in society and develop empathy for others.

Overall, the critical approach is meant to do more than just impart reading and writing skills. It recognizes that literacy education is tied to the conveyance of social and cultural values. It aims to teach children in primary schools to be readers and thinkers who understand, question, and seek to address the societal issues around them in an informed and compassionate way. The ultimate goal is the development of citizens who can build a fairer, more just, and equitable world through the power of critical consciousness and literacy.

In summary, the critical approach to literacy takes a broader view of literacy to include promoting critical thinking, questioning biases, developing empathy, and nurturing active and engaged citizens. This approach in primary schools can plant the seeds for children to become discerning and transformative individuals able to advance positive social change.
