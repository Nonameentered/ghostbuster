Here is a draft 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

Non-state law, such as religious law or customary law, differs from state law in its ability to enforce penalties and punishments in several key ways. State law is codified and enforced by the government, giving it a monopoly on the legitimate use of force. Non-state law, on the other hand, relies on voluntary compliance and community enforcement. If a party violates customary or religious law, the community may ostracize them or impose social sanctions, but rarely would use force. State law can impose incarceration, fines, or even execution as punishment, while non-state law typically is limited to community sanction and pressure to comply.  

The choice of law in cases involving parties from different backgrounds is complex with many factors to consider. When both parties are members of the same cultural or religious group, they may choose to resolve disputes according to their shared non-state law. However, if they are from different groups, choice of law becomes more complicated. States typically apply a set hierarchy to determine applicable law. They may first consider any explicit choice of law stipulated in contracts between the parties. In the absence of an explicit choice, courts will apply the law of the jurisdiction with the "closest connection" to the dispute, considering factors like the location of important transactions or events, the nationality or domicile of the parties, and so on.  

If no clear choice emerges, the dispute may be resolved according to forum law - the law of the court where the case is being heard. However, forum law is not always appropriate, especially when it disadvantages one of the parties. In some cases, states apply the concept of "public policy" to override normal choice of law rules if the outcome would violate some fundamental principle of the forum. These public policy exceptions aim to protect the interests of justice and fairness. 

Increasingly, some multi-cultural countries recognize that traditional choice of law analysis may not always lead to the fairest result when cultural, religious and legal diversity are at play. As a result, some have incorporated religious and customary law into state law through statutes allowing parties to choose to resolve disputes according to specified non-state law systems. For example, several countries with religious minorities have established "Sharia courts" to adjudicate disputes between parties who choose to apply Islamic law. These state-sanctioned non-state law systems allow cultural and religious traditions to be recognized legally while still being subject to certain state controls and review.

In conclusion, while non-state law differs substantially from state law in its penal characteristics, choice of law analysis incorporates consideration of non-state law and aims to respect cultural diversity and protect parties from unfair disadvantage before the law. The incorporation of non-state law into state law through statutes and reviewable cultural courts may provide the most balanced solution to potentially complex disputes in multi-cultural societies. Overall, the relationship between state law and non-state customary, religious and cultural traditions remains an evolving area of law with many complexities still left to resolve.
