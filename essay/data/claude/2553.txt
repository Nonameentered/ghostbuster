The production of an egg in birds is a complex biological process that involves the development of an ovum into a mature egg as it travels through the female bird's reproductive tract. The initial stage of egg production begins in the ovary, where oogonia develop into primary oocytes. These oocytes remain in a suspended state of meiosis I until egg production is stimulated by mating or other environmental factors. 

Once egg production begins, the primary oocytes complete meiosis I to become secondary oocytes, each containing half the genetic material needed to form an embryo. The secondary oocytes become ova, which are ovulated from the ovary into the oviduct. The oviduct, also known as the fallopian tube, is where the ovum will transform into a fully formed egg.

When an ovum is released into the oviduct, it is surrounded by follicle cells in a mass known as the cumulus oophorus. These cells nourish and protect the ovum as it travels down the oviduct. The first region of the oviduct is the infundibulum, which receives the cumulus oophorus. Finger-like projections called fimbriae help guide the cumulus oophorus into the oviduct.

In the magnum region of the oviduct, albumen proteins are secreted around the ovum to form the egg white. The egg white provides nutrition, protein, and protects the yolk and embryo. Two layers of albumen are formed: the inner and outer layers. The inner layer is more watery, while the outer layer is thicker.

The ovum then moves into the isthmus, the narrowest region of the oviduct. In the isthmus, the vitelline membrane is formed around the ovum. The vitelline membrane creates an isolated environment for the development of the embryo and separates the contents of the yolk from the egg white. 

The shell gland, also known as the uterus, is the final region of the oviduct. In the shell gland, the egg obtains most of its final characteristics. The egg yolk, rich in lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins, is deposited around the ovum. Next, the eggshell is formed in the shell gland. Made primarily of calcium carbonate, the eggshell protects the internal contents of the egg and controls the exchange of gases and water vapor.  

Two uterocalyceal glands located near the shell gland secrete calcium and other ions used in eggshell formation. Other secretory glands, including magalum and isthmus glands, secrete carbohydrates and proteins used to nourish the embryonic tissues and facilitate their growth. The completed egg exits the vent, also known as the cloaca, and is laid by the female bird.

The complex process of egg development in birds involves the differentiation of an ovum into a mature egg with essential structures for protecting, nourishing, and sustaining an embryo. The oviduct provides the environment for transforming the ovum into an egg with a nutritious yolk, protective eggshell, and egg white that will support the growth of an embryo if the egg is fertilized after laying. The secretions from various glands along the oviduct also contribute necessary proteins, carbohydrates, and other nutrients to sustain the development of the embryo inside a fertilized egg. Overall, avian egg production results in a vehicle for reproduction that provides everything needed to produce a new individual.
