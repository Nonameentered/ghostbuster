Protagoras, a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher, is famous for his claim that "man is the measure of all things." This statement is often interpreted as advocating an early form of relativism. Protagoras seemed to suggest that truth and moral goodness are relative to individuals and societies. As such, there are no absolute or objective standards of knowledge or ethics. 

One interpretation of Protagoras' relativism is that it is a form of descriptive relativism. That is, Protagoras was merely describing how individuals and societies operate in practice. He observed that different people have different views about truth and morality. But he did not necessarily argue that all views are equally valid or that objective truth does not exist. On this reading, Protagoras was more of a relativistic skeptic than an outright relativist. He highlighted the diversity of human opinions but remained agnostic about metaphysical truth.

Another view is that Protagoras advocated normative relativism - the idea that morality depends on cultural conventions and individual choices, not objective facts. On this interpretation, Protagoras believed that moral rules are made by humans, not discovered through reason. So for any moral issue, there are no overriding or universally binding principles. What is morally right depends on what individuals and societies judge to be right based on their circumstances and values. 

Contemporary moral relativists invoke Protagoras in support of similar normative relativist theories. They argue that moral values are shaped by cultural traditions and personal inclinations, so there are no absolute or universal ethics. Like Protagoras, they suggest that moral rules are made, not found. Principles of ethics emerge from human conventions and choices, not external moral facts. So moral judgments should be based on the standards of particular cultures and individuals.

In conclusion, Protagoras' famous aphorism that "man is the measure of all things" is open to several interpretations. It may represent a form of descriptive relativism and skepticism about metaphysical truth. But it is most often taken as an early expression of normative moral relativism - the view that moral principles depend on human judgments, not objective moral facts. Contemporary moral relativists follow Protagoras in arguing that ethics is relative to cultures and individuals. There are no universally binding moral rules. Whether an act is right or wrong depends on the moral standards of particular societies and people. In this sense, modern relativists adopt a broadly Protagorean approach to ethics.
