Here is a draft 2221 word essay in response to the prompt:

There has been a long history of fox hunting with hounds as a sport in the United Kingdom, dating back to the 16th century. However, in recent decades it has become a controversial practice, with campaigners arguing it is cruel and unnecessary. In 2004, the Hunting Act was passed in England and Wales, banning the hunting of foxes, deer, hares and mink with hounds. The Act remains controversial, with ongoing attempts to repeal it. However, there are several justifications for the ban on hunting with hounds.

The primary justification for banning fox hunting with hounds is that it is inherently cruel and causes excessive suffering to the foxes. During a hunt, foxes are chased by a pack of hounds for miles across the countryside. The chase can last over an hour, causing tremendous fear and distress to the fox. Even if the fox is not caught, it suffers exhaustion and trauma. And when the hounds catch up to the fox, it is usually killed by multiple bites in a gruesome manner. All this amounts to unnecessary cruelty that is morally unjustifiable. Hunt supporters argue that the kill is quick, but there is clear evidence showing that is often not the case. The Burns Inquiry, commissioned by the government, found that hunting with hounds seriously compromises the welfare of foxes.

A second reason for banning hunting with hounds is that it is not an efficient form of pest control. Hunt supporters argue that fox hunting helps control the fox population and prevents overpopulation. However, population control can be better achieved through other means, such as culling and humane deterrents. Hunting with hounds is an inefficient method, as not all chases end in a kill. It is also ineffective as surviving foxes may breed more frequently. According to wildlife experts, regulated culling has been shown to be a superior approach to controlling fox numbers. Hunting with hounds is therefore an unnecessary and unjustified method of pest control. 

Finally, there are public concerns about the safety, disruption and trespassing caused by fox hunts. Hunts often pursue foxes across private land without obtaining permission, damaging crops and disturbing landowners and communities. There are also reports of hunts disrupting traffic and putting pedestrians at risk. Some hunts have even been observed chasing foxes through residential areas. All these issues undermine the argument that fox hunting is a harmless sport and recreational activity. In light of the animal welfare, public nuisance and safety issues, there are compelling justifications for banning fox hunting with hounds in the UK.
