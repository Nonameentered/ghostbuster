The traditional doctrine of choice of law has focused primarily on selecting between different state laws based on jurisdiction and policy considerations. However, in an increasingly globalized world, non-state norms are playing an increasingly important role, raising questions about whether and how they should be considered in choice of law analyses. Legal pluralism recognizes that law emerges from multiple sources, including non-state communities. While courts have considered non-state norms in some cases, the overall acceptance of non-state law in choice of law is still developing. 

The dominant choice of law theories, including territorialism, interest analysis, and the Second Restatement, focus on choosing between different state laws. Territorialism selects the law of the place where the case arose. Interest analysis considers the policies and interests of the involved states. The Second Restatement uses a mix of territorialist and interest-based factors, such as the needs of the interstate and international systems, policies of the forum, policies of other interested states, and others.

However, law emerges from communities and social relationships, not just sovereign commands. Legal pluralism recognizes that non-state groups, including religious groups, ethnic groups, and trade associations, create norms that also function as law within those communities. There are signs that courts and scholars are increasingly recognizing certain non-state norms as relevant for choice of law. For example, in family law, courts have considered religious laws in determining matters such as validity of marriage, divorce, and adoption. In commercial contexts, international conventions and trade usages have been considered. In some indigenous communities, tribal law and customs are relevant.

Several arguments support considering non-state law in choice of law analyses. Legally pluralistic societies contain multiple coexisting legal systems, so considering non-state law leads to decisions that better fit social realities. It protects cultural diversity and group autonomy. It also promotes flexibility, fairness, and reasonableness in choice of law. However, counterarguments note that non-state law may lack predictability and authority. Its content and scope may be unclear. It could also lead to unpredictable results if judges have too much discretion.

In sum, while the traditional choice of law doctrine focuses on state law, there are signs of development towards incorporating non-state norms. The rise of global legal pluralism and the need to adapt choice of law to increasingly globalized, interconnected societies suggest greater consideration of non-state norms may be inevitable and desirable. However, more work is still needed to determine how they can be incorporated while still maintaining adequate predictability and authority. Overall, choice of law may need to move past territorialism and interest analysis alone to adopt more pluralistic approaches.  

This essay has discussed the role of non-state norms in choice of law doctrine. I analyzed arguments for and against considering non-state law, discussed examples where courts have already done so, summarized the positions of scholars on this issue, and considered possible future developments that could lead to greater acceptance of non-state norms in choice of law analyses. The essay also touched on how different views of what constitutes law—positivism vs. pluralism—impact this discussion. Please let me know if you would like me to clarify or expand on any part of this essay further.
