Chocolate consumption and expenditure are influenced by a variety of factors. Researchers have employed multiple methodologies to investigate the drivers of chocolate purchasing and develop effective market segmentation strategies. 

A common approach is surveying chocolate consumers using questionnaires. For example, a study by Mintel surveyed over 2,000 chocolate eaters in the UK to determine attitudes and behaviors. The survey found that taste, quality, and brand were the most important factors in chocolate choice, with over 60% of respondents citing these as key drivers. Price and promotions were less significant, implying consumers value quality and brand over cost. The Mintel study also found that women, families with children, and higher-income households spent more on chocolate, suggesting demographic factors strongly influence expenditure.

Experimental approaches have also been used to analyze the psychology of chocolate consumption. In an experiment, researchers gave study participants a fixed budget and found that when a variety of chocolate options were available, people were willing to pay higher prices for higher cocoa content. However, when only a few options were offered, participants focused more on brand and packaging. This indicates that while chocolate aficionados value quality, brand and marketing also drive choice when alternatives are limited.

Observational and panel data studies have analyzed actual purchasing behavior to determine spending patterns. For example, Kantar Worldpanel collects data on 30,000 UK households including information on purchasing, consumption, and waste. Their research found that while volume sales have declined, revenue and spending have increased in the chocolate market due to premiumization and trading up to higher-quality chocolates. Data also showed that dark chocolate, considered a more premium product, experienced sales growth of over 30% in recent years.

Further research could help Sainsbury better segment the chocolate market. Additional survey data on attitudes, brand preferences, and willingness to pay for specialty chocolates could identify key consumer groups to target. Longitudinal panel data tracking how customers trade up to premium chocolates over time would yield insight into how to incentivize this behavior.  Store-level experiments changing chocolate product placement, pricing, and promotions could determine the most effective strategies to drive sales, especially for higher-margin products.

Sainsbury could also consider new data collection methods, such as social media monitoring, to gain qualitative insights into consumers' chocolate preferences and reactions to new products or marketing campaigns. Digital ethnographic studies observing how people actually select and eat chocolates could uncover new patterns to leverage. As more consumers embrace online shopping, analysis of e-commerce data may reveal distinct segments of customers who prefer to buy chocolates digitally. Additional research and data utilization will enable Sainsbury to tailor product offerings, pricing, marketing, and the overall customer experience to best match the needs and values of each chocolate consumer segment.
