Maternal effect genes are maternally expressed genes that contribute to early embryonic development. In the nematode C. elegans, maternal effect genes are essential for establishing the axes of the embryo and directing asymmetric cell divisions that give rise to cell fates. Several key maternal effect genes in C. elegans include the PAR proteins, MEX-5 and MEX-6, and SKN-1.

When the C. elegans zygote is first formed, it contains maternal factors deposited in the oocyte by the mother. These maternal factors include mRNAs and proteins that are asymmetrically distributed in the egg and early embryo. The asymmetric distribution of these maternal factors determines the anterior-posterior axis, dorso-ventral axis, and left-right axis of the developing embryo before zygotic transcription commences.

The PAR proteins (PAR-1, PAR-2, PAR-3, PAR-4, PAR-5, and PAR-6) are maternal effect proteins that become asymmetrically localized at the first cell division to establish the anterior-posterior axis. PAR-3, PAR-6, and PKC-3 become concentrated at the anterior side of the zygote, while PAR-1 and PAR-2 become localized to the posterior side. This asymmetric distribution of PAR proteins results in an unequal first cell division, with distinct anterior and posterior blastomeres that have different developmental fates. Mutations in the PAR proteins can disrupt this asymmetric division and cause defects in cell fate specification.

The CCCH zinc finger proteins MEX-5 and MEX-6 are maternally expressed genes that regulate anterior-posterior axis formation. MEX-5 and MEX-6 proteins accumulate in the anterior of the zygote before the first cell division and promote the anterior fate. In embryos lacking MEX-5 and MEX-6, the blastomeres fail to adopt distinct anterior and posterior fates, indicating these maternal factors are required for proper axis formation and cell fate specification. 

The SKN-1 protein is a maternally provided transcription factor that specifies the dorso-ventral axis. SKN-1 accumulates in the dorsal side of the zygote nucleus and activates target genes that specify dorsal cell fates. In SKN-1 mutants, dorsal cell fates are lost and embryos lack a dorso-ventral axis. Thus, the asymmetric localization of SKN-1 in the zygote is essential for establishing dorsal-ventral polarity in the early C. elegans embryo.

In summary, maternal effect genes program the earliest stages of embryonic development in C. elegans before zygotic transcription. Through the asymmetric distribution of proteins and mRNAs deposited in the oocyte, maternal factors set up the axes of the embryo and direct asymmetric cell divisions that give rise to distinct cell lineages. The anterior-posterior axis is established by PAR proteins and MEX-5/6, the dorso-ventral axis is set up by SKN-1, and the left-right axis is also regulated by asymmetrically distributed maternal factors. By acting as an initial source of polarity and specifying cell fates, maternal effect genes lay the foundation for the elaborated development of the multicellular C. elegans embryo.
