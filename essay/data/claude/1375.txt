The securitization of the environment has significant implications for the perception of global security. Traditionally, global security has focused on military and geopolitical threats between nation states. However, the recognition of environmental threats as security issues, particularly since the end of the Cold War, has broadened the scope of global security to include non-traditional threats that transcend national borders and impact humanity as a whole.

Specifically, the framing of sustainable development and environmental protection as security issues has shaped global security discourses and policies in ways that often reflect and reinforce power imbalances between the global North and South. When environmental issues like climate change are framed as security threats, it justifies the concentration of resources and decision-making power within Western governments and institutions. For example, the United Nations Security Council can determine what constitutes a “threat to international peace and security,” and has debated climate change from this security perspective. However, the Security Council is dominated by Western permanent members, while those most vulnerable to climate change in the global South have little representation or power.

Similarly, sustainable development is meant to balance environmental protection, economic growth, and social well-being. However, in practice, Western countries have defined sustainable development and set the global agenda with a focus on the environmental dimension over economic and social development priorities in the global South. When sustainable development is securitized as an issue of protecting the environment and natural resources from the threat of poor development practices and overpopulation, it portrays underdevelopment as the security threat rather than the historical legacies of overconsumption and wealth concentration in the West. 

In these ways, the securitization of the environment has been used to legitimize policy responses and actions that consolidate control over natural resources, lock in global economic inequalities, and curb development in the global South. Broadening the scope of global security in this way has provided discursive pathways to turn differences in values, priorities, and interests into security threats. It does not have to be this way. A more just and equitable sustainability transition worldwide depends on overcoming imbalances of power in global environmental governance and framing sustainable development as a collective security interest in prosperity and well-being for all. In summary, environmental securitization has shaped global security in ways that reflect and amplify global inequities, but could instead be re-framed to empower a more just transition.
