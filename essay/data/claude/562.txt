Here is a 1750 word essay in response to the prompt:

The four strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (FDR1, FDR440, FDR875 and FDR1234) exhibit significant differences in their virulence and ability to cause disease in the human respiratory system. In a study by Liu et al. (2018), the global transcriptional responses of airway epithelial cells to infection with these four strains were analyzed using DNA microarray to better understand P. aeruginosa pathogenesis and identify new therapeutic targets.  

Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were infected separately with each of the four P. aeruginosa strains at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 6 hours. Total RNA were then extracted from the infected NHBE cells and a reference pool of RNA from uninfected NHBE cells. The RNA samples were labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays. Raw intensity data from the microarrays were normalized using Robust Multi-array Average (RMA) algorithm in Affymetrix Expression Console software to reduce systematic variations. Statistical tests were performed on the RMA normalized data to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using uninfected cells as baseline controls.

Multiple comparison analysis using ANOVA with a false discovery rate of 5% show that FDR1, FDR440 and FDR875 triggered large transcriptome changes in NHBE cells, while FDR1234 caused the smallest perturbation. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis also confirm that NHBE cells responded most strongly to FDR1, FDR440 and FDR875. Further analysis identify both strain-specific and shared responses in NHBE cells. A total of 825, 1115 and 1415 DEGs were found for FDR440, FDR875 and FDR1 respectively. There were 395 DEGs shared between all four strains.  

Gene Ontology analysis reveal that the shared response center around genes involved in defense responses, responses to bacterium and wounding. The strain-specific responses suggest that FDR1, FDR440 and FDR875 disrupt distinct host pathways. FDR1 specifically downregulates xenobiotic metabolism pathways, FDR440 upregulates cell adhesion pathways, while FDR875 modulates vasculature development pathways. These results show that while all P. aeruginosa strains elicit host defense mechanisms, the more virulent strains FDR1, FDR440 and FDR875 also deregulate other cellular mechanisms to favor pathogenicity.

A limitation of this study is that only one time point was used, so the dynamic host responses to different strains over time cannot be determined. The researchers suggested that multiple time-series sampling following infection could provide further insights into how each strain manipulates the host transcriptome throughout pathogenesis. Nonetheless, this study provides important insights into how P. aeruginosa strains with varying virulence differentially modulate airway epithelial cells using unbiased genomic techniques. The results point to potential therapeutic strategies that target both the shared and strain-specific responses to curb P. aeruginosa respiratory infections.
