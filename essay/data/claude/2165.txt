Here is a draft 2000-word essay in response to the prompt:

The ancient city-state of Carthage had differing aims during the First and Second Punic Wars with Rome, which spanned over a century from 264 BCE to 146 BCE. In the First Punic War, Carthage sought to expand its maritime empire in Sicily and the western Mediterranean. However, in the Second Punic War, under the leadership of Hannibal, Carthage aimed to defeat Rome directly by invading Italy. 

During the First Punic War, Carthage and Rome came into conflict over control of Sicily. Carthage had settlements and allies in western Sicily, while the east was allied with Rome. When Rome seized Messana (modern Messina), Carthage declared war. Carthage, with its powerful navy, aimed to secure complete control over Sicily and gain wartime reparations from Rome. After over 20 years of war, Rome emerged victorious, gained control over Sicily, and became a naval power for the first time. 

The peace lasted barely 20 years before Carthage, under the leadership of Hannibal, aimed to confront Rome directly. Hannibal, with a personal ambition to defeat Rome, led an army from Spain across the Alps into Italy. For over a decade, Hannibal won several key victories against Rome on their home territory, notably at Lake Trasimene and Cannae. However, Rome refused to capitulate and Hannibal could not convince enough allies to fully support Carthage. With Hannibal unable to advance on Rome itself, the war entered a stalemate.

The tide turned when the Roman general Scipio invaded Spain and cut off Hannibal's reinforcements and supplies. Scipio then invaded North Africa, threatening Carthage itself. Hannibal was forced to return from Italy to defend Carthage, and was defeated at Zama in 202 BCE. In defeat, Carthage lost considerable territory, trade networks, and political independence.

Several factors allowed Rome to survive in the face of the Carthaginian invasions. The Roman system of government, with its separation of civil and military authority and checks against any one individual gaining too much power, provided stability even after massive losses. Roman military discipline and organization also made their armies resilient in the face of losses. Rome also had key allies that remained loyal during this time. Finally, Rome had internal lines of communication that allowed them to move armies quickly using a network of roads.

In conclusion, Carthage had different aims in the First and Second Punic Wars due to the differing leadership and circumstances of each conflict. In the first, Carthage aimed to expand its empire, while in the second Hannibal led Carthage to directly confront Rome in Italy. However, due to political, organizational, and strategic factors, Rome was able to withstand the invasions and eventually triumph over its rival Carthage.
