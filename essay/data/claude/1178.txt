The aim of the project investigating the influence of a wall on the movement of a vortex ring travelling in water was to understand how walls affect the propagation and behavior of vortex rings. Vortex rings are naturally occurring phenomena that are important in topics ranging from propulsion to fluid transport in nature. To study the effect of walls, modifications were made to an existing vortex ring generator to allow the production of vortex rings in close proximity to a wall. By systematically varying the distance of the wall from the vortex ring formation point, the influence of the wall at different separation distances could be examined.  

The modifications to the vortex ring generator involved the addition of a rectangular plexiglass tube that fit around the exterior of the vortex ring generator nozzle. This tube was used to provide a defined channel in which the vortex rings could propagate after formation until they either impacted the end wall of the tube or exited the channel outlet. The length of the channel could be adjusted to examine vortex ring wall interactions at different distances from the formation point. Holes were drilled in the sides of the channel to allow for flow visualization of the vortex rings inside the channel.     

The results of the investigation showed that the wall began to substantially influence the vortex rings at a distance of approximately 3-4 nozzle diameters from the formation point. Closer than this, the rings were able to propagate freely as if no wall was present. Beyond 3-4 diameters, the vortex rings flattened and stretched out in the direction parallel to the wall. This was caused by a pushing of the vortex ring fluid against the wall which redirected the momentum and energy of the vortex ring. In some cases, smaller vortex rings could be seen peeling off from the main ring at the wall. At larger distances from the formation point, roughly 10 diameters and beyond, the vortex ring impacts with the wall resulted mostly in the formation of secondary vortices and turbulent cascade in the flow rather than an orderly vortex ring.  

Vortex rings occur naturally in a variety of situations, including in the human heart during ventricular filling and in the wake behind dolphins and whales swimming at high speeds. They are also utilized by squid and octopuses for locomotion by expelling a jet of fluid and forming vortex rings. Vortex rings are formed through the ejection of a circular vortex sheet or slug of fluid into a surrounding mass of fluid. This introduces angular momentum and vorticity into the surrounding fluid which then rolls up into a stable vortex ring structure. 

The factors that determine whether initially laminar or turbulent vortex rings are formed depend on both the geometry of the vortex generator as well as the velocity profile of the ejected fluid. If the ejected sheet or slug of fluid has an even velocity profile and laminar flow pattern, it will roll up into a coherent laminar vortex ring. Irregularities or instabilities in the ejected flow will result in more turbulent vortex ring formation. The vortex generator geometry also depends on having a circular opening for the most coherent laminar rings. Any deviations from a circular geometry or effects like fluid shear around the edges of the opening can contribute to more turbulent ring formation.

In summary, the project investigating the influence of a wall on vortex ring propagation discovered that walls substantially impact vortex ring movement starting at a distance of 3-4 vortex ring diameters. Closer than this, the rings are largely unaffected, but beyond this point, the wall causes vortex ring flattening, stretching, and disruption. Vortex rings are naturally occurring circular flows that are important in propulsion and fluid transport. They form based on the ejection of a vortex sheet or slug of fluid, with coherent laminar rings resulting from uniform circular ejection.
