Single- and multi-strategy research designs each have their virtues and drawbacks within nursing research. Single-strategy designs, utilizing either quantitative or qualitative methodologies alone, are relatively straightforward to implement but provide a limited perspective. In contrast, multi-strategy designs integrate quantitative and qualitative methods and can yield a more comprehensive understanding of complex research problems, but they present greater epistemological and methodological challenges.

The study by Williams (1998) employs a single qualitative methodology, grounded theory, to explore nurses’ perspectives on delivering high-quality care. The use of semi-structured interviews and constant comparative analysis allowed Williams to develop an in-depth conceptual framework explaining the key factors that shape nurses’ ability to provide quality care. However, the study is limited by its sole reliance on qualitative data from a small sample. Integrating quantitative data on care quality and patient outcomes could have strengthened the study by providing a more well-rounded assessment of the issues.

In contrast, the study by Nelson et al. (2009) utilizes a multi-strategy design, combining cross-sectional surveys, in-depth interviews, and hospital record reviews to evaluate emergency care systems in Serbia. The use of mixed methods allowed the researchers to quantify system deficiencies, explore stakeholders’ perspectives, and analyze patient outcomes, providing a comprehensive assessment that could not have been achieved through a single method. However, mixing methods also introduced greater complexity, as the researchers had to ensure the different components were complementary, determine a logical sequence of methods, and decide how to integrate the results.

Overall, while single-strategy designs may be simpler to implement, multi-strategy research is often better suited to address complex issues in real-world settings. The choice of an appropriate design depends on a study’s aims and objectives. For exploratory work, qualitative methods may be preferred, as in Williams’ (1998) grounded theory study. For evaluations requiring an in-depth understanding of system functioning and outcomes, mixed methods are likely more suitable, as demonstrated in Nelson et al.’s (2009) evaluation of emergency care. 

In summary, nursing research would benefit from an expanded use of well-designed multi-strategy studies to investigate the challenges of providing quality patient care. When performed rigorously, mixed methods research can yield a level of insight unattainable through individual qualitative or quantitative approaches alone. However, such designs require extensive methodological expertise to develop, implement, and integrate different components in a coherent and meaningful way. With proper training and execution, multi-strategy research has the potential to significantly advance nursing knowledge and practice.
