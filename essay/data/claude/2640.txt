Here is a draft 750 word essay in response to the prompt:

The solubility product (Ksp) of a slightly soluble ionic compound refers to the equilibrium constant for the dissolution of the compound in an aqueous solution at a given temperature. For potassium periodate (KIO4), the solubility product is the equilibrium constant for the reaction:
KIO4(s) ⇌ K+(aq) + IO4-(aq)
The solubility product of KIO4 can be determined experimentally through a titration method. A saturated solution of KIO4 is prepared by adding excess KIO4 solid to a known volume of distilled water and allowing it to reach equilibrium. The concentrations of K+ and IO4- ions are then determined by titrating the solution with a standard solution of NaOH and KI/starch indicator. 

From the titration results, the molar solubility of KIO4, that is the concentration of K+ and IO4- ions at equilibrium, can be calculated. The Ksp is then obtained from the molar solubility based on the formula:
Ksp = [K+]eq[IO4-]eq

For KIO4 at 25°C, the molar solubility is found to be 0.0161 mol/L. Therefore, the solubility product constant is (0.0161)2 = 0.000258 mol2/L2. The Ksp value indicates that KIO4 has a relatively low solubility in water.

The solubility of ionic compounds can be altered by the addition of electrolytes through two effects: salting in and salting out. Salting in refers to an increase in solubility due to the addition of indifferent electrolytes such as NaCl to the solution. The increase in ionic strength of the solution suppresses the ionization of water, leading to a higher solubility of the weak electrolyte. Salting out refers to a decrease in solubility upon the addition of a common ion, such as KCl to a KIO4 solution. The common ion effect shifts the equilibrium to the left, decreasing the molar solubility according to Le Chatelier's principle.

In summary, the solubility product of KIO4 can be determined experimentally by measuring the molar solubility of a saturated solution. It depends on several factors including temperature, ionic strength, and common ion effect. The concepts of heterogeneous equilibrium, molar solubility, common ion effect and inert ion effect are useful in predicting and explaining the solubility behaviors of weak electrolytes.
