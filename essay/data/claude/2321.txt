There are three main types of egg production systems in the UK - cage, barn, and free range. The vast majority of eggs produced in the UK, approximately 60%, come from cage systems. However, there has been increasing demand for cage-free eggs in recent years due to animal welfare concerns. 

Under cage systems, hens are housed in cages that limit their movement. Each hen has access to food and water but limited space to roam. Cage systems are the most efficient in terms of egg production as the confined spaces make it easier to control feeding, lighting, and collect eggs. However, cage systems have faced criticism over hen welfare as the confined spaces prevent natural behaviors.

In barn and free range systems, hens have more freedom and space. Barn systems house hens in large open spaces, often in litter-covered floors. Hens can roam, nest, and perch freely but remain confined within the barn. Free range systems provide hens access to an outside range during the day in addition to the indoor space. Free range is considered the most humane but often has lower egg production and higher costs.

Wall-Hanger farm houses over 200,000 hens in a free range system with access to 53 acres of outdoor range. The farm must meet the British Egg Industry Lion Code of Practice to sell their eggs. This includes standards for housing, feed, lighting, veterinary care, transport, and slaughter. For example, the indoor stocking density cannot exceed 9 hens per square meter, and the outdoor range must provide at least 2.5 square meters of space per hen. 

To maximize egg production, Wall-Hanger farm carefully controls lighting, feeding, and temperature. Hens require 16 hours of daylight to stimulate egg laying, so artificial lighting supplements natural light in the winter. A balanced layer feed with adequate calcium and protein is provided ad libitum. The ideal temperature for hens is around 20Â°C, so ventilation, heating, and cooling systems maintain this temperature year-round. 

Despite close management, there are challenges to egg production. Market fluctuations in supply and demand impact the profitability and growth of the farm. Disease outbreaks and mortality within the flock can reduce egg production and require veterinary care, impacting costs. Predation from foxes, badgers, and birds of prey is also a risk for free range systems.

In conclusion, cage, barn, and free range are the main egg production systems in the UK with free range and barn accounting for a growing market share. Producers like Wall-Hanger farm must closely monitor factors affecting egg production and hen welfare to maximize output and comply with regulations. However, the industry faces ongoing challenges from market forces, disease, mortality, and predation. Overall, striking a balance between productivity, cost-effectiveness, and hen welfare is key to a sustainable egg industry in the UK.
