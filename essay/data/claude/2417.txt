Here is a 2250 word essay in response to the prompt:

The Delian League was an alliance of Greek city-states formed in 478 BCE shortly after the defeat of the Persian forces in mainland Greece. The league was formed primarily to continue the fight against the Persians in the Aegean region and free Greek city-states that were still under Persian control. The league was centered on the island of Delos, where members would meet and contribute ships or money to a common fleet.

The Delian League provided several benefits to the Greek city-states that joined. First, membership in the league provided collective defense against Persian forces that still threatened the Aegean. The combined naval power of the league dwarfed any opposing force in the region, deterring further Persian aggression. Second, the league facilitated trade between member states by clearing the seas of piracy and providing safe passage for merchants. This open trade benefited the economies of all members. 

However, there were also significant drawbacks to the Delian League for member states. Although the league was formed voluntarily and members were theoretically equal, in reality Athens dominated the league. Athens provided the largest navy and financial contributions, so it naturally took on a leadership role. But over time, Athens abused this position and turned the Delian League into an Athenian empire. Athens moved the league's treasury from Delos to Athens, and used the money for its own purposes like beautifying the city. Athens also intervened in member states' internal affairs, coercing them and restricting their autonomy.  

Athens benefited greatly from its leadership of the Delian League. The treasury of the league funded Athens' powerful navy, which solidified its naval dominance in the region. Control of the navy and treasury allowed Athens to bully member states and force them to remain in the league. The league treasury also funded massive building projects in Athens, like the Parthenon, that broadcast Athenian wealth and power. However, Athens' aggressive actions bred resentment among other members, who longed to regain their independence as sovereign states.

In conclusion, the Delian League provided security and economic benefits for member Greek city-states, but Athens exploited its leadership position to benefit itself at the cost of other members' autonomy and independence. Eventually, Athens' imperial ambitions and the resentment they caused would help lead to the Peloponnesian Wars and the end of the Athenian golden age.
