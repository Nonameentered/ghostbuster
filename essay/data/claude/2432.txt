There are several factors that influence the choice of modulation and coding schemes when designing a communications system:

Bandwidth efficiency. The bandwidth available for communication is often limited, so modulation and coding techniques that can pack more information into a fixed bandwidth are desirable. Digital modulation techniques like quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase-shift keying (PSK) can encode multiple bits per symbol and offer higher bandwidth efficiency than simple modulation techniques like amplitude modulation (AM) or frequency modulation (FM). Similarly, channel coding techniques like turbo codes and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can compress data and provide forward error correction, allowing for higher bandwidth efficiency.

Power efficiency. In many communication systems, especially wireless systems, available transmit power is limited. Modulation and coding schemes that can operate at lower power levels are therefore attractive. Phase modulation techniques like PSK typically require less power than amplitude modulation techniques to achieve the same error rate. Coding schemes can also help by correcting errors and reducing retransmissions.  

Reliability and error performance. The modulation and coding scheme must provide an acceptable bit error rate (BER) or symbol error rate (SER) for the application. More complex modulation constellations with more points, like 64-QAM, can encode more bits per symbol but tend to have higher error rates than simpler constellations like QPSK. Stronger coding schemes can achieve lower error rates but often at the cost of reduced bandwidth efficiency. The scheme must strike a balance between efficiency and reliability.

Complexity. More complex modulation and coding techniques may require more complex transmitters and receivers, increasing cost, size, and power consumption. For some applications, simpler schemes may be preferred if they can achieve adequate performance. The complexity of a scheme also affects how difficult and expensive it is to build into integrated circuits for high-frequency applications.

These modulation and coding schemes can be tested and compared in several ways:

Mathematical analysis. The BER or SER performance of a modulation scheme can be calculated mathematically based on the geometry of the constellation and channel noise. The performance of coding schemes can also be estimated mathematically based on the minimum distance between codewords. These theoretical performance metrics provide a starting point for comparing different options.

Computer simulation. More accurate performance comparisons can be done through computer simulations that model the modulation, coding, channel impacts like noise and interference, and receiver processing. Monte Carlo simulations can determine BER, SER, and other metrics. These simulations provide performance estimates without needing to build hardware.

Prototyping and over-the-air testing. For the most realistic performance assessment, prototypes can be built and tested over a real communication channel. In wireless systems, over-the-air testing with transmitters and receivers can determine performance in environments with interference, multipath, and other channel effects that are hard to fully simulate. Physical prototypes also identify any unforeseen implementation challenges with a particular scheme.  

In summary, bandwidth efficiency, power efficiency, reliability, complexity, and real-world testing are all crucial factors in selecting modulation and coding schemes for a communications system. Finding the right balance of these factors for a particular application and channel is key to achieving high performance. Overall, there is no single modulation or coding scheme that is ideal for all situations, so a thorough comparison and testing process must be followed to make the best choice.
