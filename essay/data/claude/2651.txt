The aim of this experiment was to analyze the carotenoid content of marigold petals using High Performance Liquid Chromatography or HPLC. HPLC is an analytical method used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture. It relies on pumps to pass a pressurized liquid solvent containing the sample mixture through a column filled with a solid adsorbent material. Each component in the mixture interacts differently with the adsorbent, thus exiting the column at different times. This allows a detection method such as UV-Vis spectrometry to identify and quantify each component as it elutes from the column.  

To perform the experiment, marigold petals were first ground and an extract was prepared using acetone as the solvent. The samples were filtered and diluted before being analyzed using a C18 column and a mobile phase of methanol and water. The carotenoids were detected by their absorbance at 450 nm using a UV-Vis detector. 

The results identified the three main carotenoids in marigold petals as lutein, zeaxanthin, and Î²-cryptoxanthin based on their characteristic retention times and absorption spectra. Lutein was the most abundant at over 50% of total carotenoid content. The data obtained seemed very accurate with little variability between repeated injections of the same sample. However, some potential sources of error could be imperfect filtration leading to particles entering the column, variations in the grinding of samples introducing inconsistencies, and fluctuations in mobile phase flow rate or composition influencing retention times.

In summary, the experiment utilized HPLC with UV-Vis detection to successfully identify and quantify the carotenoid content of marigold petals, specifically determining lutein as the primary carotenoid. Care must be taken to minimize experimental errors to ensure the highest accuracy and validity of results. HPLC is a powerful technique for analysis of complex natural product extracts. With this data, plant breeders can better develop marigold cultivars with optimized lutein content and other beneficial phytochemicals.
