The aim of investigating the language of medically premature children is to gain a better understanding of how their language acquisition and development may differ from children born at full term. Premature birth can impact language learning in various ways, including potential delays in speech and language milestones, difficulties with phonological processing, and impacts on vocabulary and grammar development. Studying the language of premature children enables researchers to identify both areas of strength and areas that may require early intervention to support typical language development.

The methodology used in studies of premature children's language acquisition commonly include longitudinal studies that follow children over time, starting from an early age. Researchers collect data through recording spontaneous speech and language samples, conducting standardized assessments, and using experimental tasks designed to evaluate specific aspects of language like phonological awareness. These methods differ from previous studies that often relied only on parental reports or assessments at a single point in time. By observing language abilities directly and consistently over the course of development, researchers gain a much more accurate understanding of each child's skills and the progress they are making.

Several factors contribute to an accurate assessment of a premature child's language abilities. Studies should control for medical factors like degree of prematurity, health issues, and time spent in the NICU to determine their impact on language outcomes. Assessments should be administered at corrected age, adjusted for degree of prematurity, rather than chronological age. Using norm-referenced, standardized assessments allows researchers to compare a child's scores to same-age peers. Experimental tasks should be tailored to the child's developmental level to gain information even from children with limited language. Longitudinal data, observational reports from parents and clinicians, and analysis of spontaneous language samples provide a more comprehensive picture of a child's abilities than a single assessment alone.   

With an increased focus on the language development of premature children over the last few decades, researchers now have a much better understanding of how prematurity can influence language learning and which children may be at higher risk of delays. Continuing to investigate the language acquisition of this population, using rigorous and multidimensional methodology, will enable clinicians to develop better screening tools and early interventions to support the language development of all children. Overall, studying the language of premature children has significant implications for predicting and supporting healthy development.
