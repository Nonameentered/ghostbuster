Chimpanzees are social animals that live in groups in the wild, known as communities. In captivity, zoos often house chimpanzees in social groups to provide mental stimulation and opportunities for natural social behavior. The composition of these captive groups, specifically the sex ratio, can have a significant influence on the chimpanzees' behavior and welfare.  

All-female chimpanzee groups tend to be more socially cohesive and less aggressive compared to mixed-sex groups. Female chimps form close social bonds and strong alliances with each other. They groom each other frequently, share food, and cooperate during conflicts with males. In contrast, males are often more competitive and hierarchy focused. They show higher levels of aggression and violence towards each other as they compete for status and access to females. 

In mixed-sex captive groups, much of the males' aggression is directed at females, especially when females are in estrus. Males will often violently attack females during estrus to gain mating opportunities, causing injury and stress. All-female groups avoid this problem and provide a safer social environment for females with fewer injuries and less chronic stress. 

Several zoos in the UK have found success with all-female chimpanzee groups. Notable examples include Chester Zoo and Twycross Zoo, which have maintained stable all-female groups for over 10 years. These groups show high levels of social bonding, cooperation, and play behavior. The females tend to form strong linear dominance hierarchies but show little overt aggression. By contrast, many mixed-sex groups in UK zoos struggle with aggression, injuries, and difficulty maintaining stable social dynamics.

In conclusion, captive all-female chimpanzee groups tend to enable more natural social behavior and improve welfare compared to mixed-sex groups. Female chimps can thrive in social environments free from male aggression and violence. All-female groups should thus be considered an important management strategy for zoos striving to meet the behavioral needs of captive chimpanzees. Overall, sex composition has a profound effect on chimpanzee dynamics in captivity that impacts both behavior and well-being.
