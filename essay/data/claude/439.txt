Religion had an enormous impact on people's daily lives in early modern Europe. Religious institutions, figures, and practices shaped many aspects of society, culture, economics, and politics during this time period.

The Catholic Church and, after the Reformation, other Christian denominations were dominant social and cultural institutions in Europe. The church provided education, care for the poor and sick, and shaped social life through rites such as baptisms, marriages, and funerals. Religious authorities censored speech, art, music, and other culture production to ensure it aligned with doctrine. The church calendar set the rhythm of the year, with holy days of obligation, seasons like Lent and Advent, and saints' feast days. Religious art, architecture, and music were also fundamental elements of culture that reinforced doctrines and shaped aesthetics. 

Economically, the church was a major landowner and employed many people. Tithing and indulgences were important sources of church revenue that also impacted laypeople. Religious doctrines influenced views on commerce, trade, and economic life. The Protestant Reformation led to the seizure of church lands and wealth in some areas of Europe, redistributing property and incomes.

Politically, religion and religious authorities wielded significant power in early modern Europe. Most rulers claimed divine rights to their thrones. Religious wars were common, as were conflicts over the official religion of states. The peace of Augsburg established the principle of cuius regio, eius religio, meaning the religion of the ruler would be the religion of the realm. The Catholic Church acted as a political entity, forming alliances and condemning rulers who defied them. 

In conclusion, religion shaped nearly every aspect of people's daily lives in early modern Europe. Religious institutions, practices, and figures influenced society, culture, economics, and politics during this period. For most ordinary people, religion was not separated from the rest of life but rather was thoroughly embedded in their existence, communities, and experiences of the world.
