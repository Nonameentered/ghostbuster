The rapid development of media technologies in recent years has greatly impacted the European media industry. New digital platforms have disrupted traditional business models for media companies based on advertising and subscription revenues from print publications and broadcast media. Social media and streaming platforms have enabled the rise of user-generated content and on-demand streaming services that provide more personalized media experiences.  

These technological changes have significantly influenced European society and culture. Social media has transformed how people connect and share information, reshaping social interactions and relationships. Streaming media services have made a huge array of on-demand content available, changing how Europeans spend their leisure time and consume entertainment and news media. New digital platforms have also enabled the spread of misinformation and 'fake news,' influencing public debates and political discourse.

The Journal of European Media and Communications Studies will assess these impacts of media technology changes and provide a forum to exchange ideas. It will cover topics such as the transformation of media business models, changes in media policy and regulation, the influence of social media and streaming platforms on society and culture, threats from online misinformation, and more. The journal's marketing objective in the first 2 years is to build subscribers from academic institutions and researchers worldwide interested in these issues.

Journal subscription prices are typically 3 to 5 times the combined costs of materials like paper, printing, and binding.  The costs of these physical materials are only a small fraction of a journal's total operating costs, most of which come from expenditures like staff salaries, office space, marketing, and distribution. By keeping subscription fees affordable while covering total costs, the Journal of European Media and Communications Studies can serve specialists in this field and achieve financial sustainability.
