Here is a draft 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

Realism has endured as an influential approach to international relations for over a century, from the post-World War I era to the present day. Its longevity and continued relevance stems from several factors: its pragmatic and practical conceptualization of state behavior and national interests, its adaptability to evolving global contexts, and its resonance with the competitive dynamics that have persisted in international politics.

In the aftermath of World War I, realism emerged as a reaction to the idealism of the League of Nations. Realists like E.H. Carr and Hans Morgenthau argued that state behavior is primarily driven by the pursuit of power and national interests, not lofty ideals. In a world where another catastrophic war had just taken place, realism's emphasis on state power and security resonated strongly. As European power declined after WWII and the bipolar Cold War began, realism offered a compelling framework for understanding global stability and conflict. Theories like balance of power and nuclear deterrence were realist concepts that shaped the Cold War system.  

With the end of the Cold War, many predicted the demise of realism. However, realism has proven adaptable to the Post-Cold War era of globalization. Realists incorporated theories of soft power, transnational actors, and global governance into their framework. They also applied realism to understand post-9/11 foreign policy issues like the war on terror. Realism remains relevant today because power politics and security competition persist among major nations like the U.S. and China. 

In conclusion, realism has stood the test of time as an IR theory because it addresses fundamental and recurring aspects of the international system - the competition for power and security between sovereign states. Though simple in concept, realism has evolved in response to the complex realities of world politics. When realism appears out of touch, it is often because an overly optimistic narrative of international harmony has temporarily prevailed, not because power politics has actually disappeared. Deep down, realism's view of human nature and state behavior still rings true, if sometimes uncomfortably so. Ultimately, realism will continue shaping global affairs as long as an international system of self-interested nation-states remains.
