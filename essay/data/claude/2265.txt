The ancient Romans developed advanced metallurgical and mechanical techniques that allowed them to produce iron wire and use it in the production of chain mail armor. Creating wire from iron would have been a difficult process that required specialized equipment and skills. The Romans likely had multiple techniques for drawing iron wire, using both manual and mechanical means.

To begin, the Romans would have needed high-quality raw iron to produce wire. The iron would have gone through a refining and purification process to reduce the carbon content, creating a soft and malleable wrought iron. This process likely involved repeatedly heating and hammering the iron to drive out impurities. Once they had suitably refined wrought iron, it could then be hammered into thin bars that could be further processed into wire. 

A simple but labor-intensive method to make wire would have been to physically hammer the iron bars into successively thinner strips. Skilled metalworkers would have hammered the bars flat, then folded the bars over and welded them together. Repeating this process, the bars could be made progressively thinner. When the iron reached a thickness of a few millimeters, it could be drawn through a series of successively smaller holes in a metal plate—a manual drawing process—to further reduce thickness until the wire reached the desired gauge. 

Mechanical means of wire drawing, using machines and motive power, were likely also employed by the Romans to increase efficiency. One possibility is that they used a power hammer, mechanically operated, to hammer the iron into thin bars. They may have also developed hand-cranked mechanical drawing machines, where the iron was pulled through a steel drawplate with increasingly smaller holes using a crank-operated system of wheels and pulleys. At its simplest, this could involve attaching the thin iron bars to a rope or strap, which was wound around a capstan or cylinder and drawn through the drawplate using manual power. More complex machines with gear ratios may have allowed multiple men to operate the system using a rotational power source like a waterwheel or treadwheel.

The end result of these processes was flexible iron wire of a small enough gauge to be wound into coils. These coils were then cut to length to make the individual rings used in chain mail armor. The Romans had a well-developed system of standardized measures, so they were likely able to produce iron wire of consistent gauges for their armories. Through the clever combining of heat, force, and machinery, the Romans were able to transform raw iron ore into the fine iron wire that gave their legions an advantage on the battlefield. Overall, a combination of human physical power, mechanical means, and Roman ingenuity came together to produce iron wire for their chain mail armor.
