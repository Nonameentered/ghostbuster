Should the UK Introduce a Value Added Tax on Unhealthy Foods?

Obesity and diet-related diseases are a growing concern in the UK. According to Public Health England, 63% of adults and 28% of children are overweight or obese. Obesity significantly increases the risk of health issues like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. In order to combat this public health crisis, some experts have proposed introducing value-added taxes (VATs) on unhealthy foods high in saturated fats, sugar, and salt. Taxing these foods could discourage consumption and fund health promotion campaigns. However, there are also arguments against implementing such "sin taxes," including their potentially regressive impact on low-income families and conflict with existing agricultural policies.  

On the one hand, taxing unhealthy foods could be an effective policy lever to improve diets and health. VATs on foods high in saturated fats, sugar and salt have been shown to reduce consumption of these products. For example, Mexico introduced a 10% tax on sugary beverages in 2014 and saw a 12% drop in sales in the first year. The revenue generated from these taxes could also fund health education and obesity prevention programs. Some studies estimate that for every £1 raised in tax, £3 can be saved in health care costs. A VAT on unhealthy foods may even encourage the food industry to reformulate products to avoid the tax. 

However, there are also several arguments against implementing such taxes. Firstly, they disproportionately impact low income families who spend a higher proportion of their income on food. While the taxes aim to discourage consumption of unhealthy options, they make all options more expensive, even for those for whom healthier alternatives are unaffordable. This could increase inequality in dietary health. Secondly, taxes on foods high in saturated fats conflict with existing agricultural policies under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) which subsidizes production of fatty foods like red meats, cheese, and butter. The CAP aims to support farmers, so taxing the foods it produces is counterproductive. 

In conclusion, while VATs on unhealthy foods could deter consumption and raise funds for health promotion, they risk negatively and disproportionately impacting low income families and undermining existing agricultural policies. A combination of alternative policy measures, such as reformulating agricultural subsidies to support production of healthier foods, mandatory nutrition labeling, advertising restrictions, and subsidizing fruit and vegetable consumption may be less regressive approaches to improving diets and public health. A VAT should only be considered as a last resort, if these alternative measures prove insufficient. Tackling diet-related disease is crucial to improving population health, but this must be done through fair and equitable policymaking.
