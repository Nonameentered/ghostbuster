There is an inextricable link between theory and policy in international relations. Theories provide frameworks for understanding the world that then inform policy choices and decision making. In the aftermath of the Cold War, the dominant theories of realism and liberalism offered contrasting perspectives on how the United States should exercise its power and establish global order. 

Realism sees international politics as an anarchic system where states are the key actors constantly seeking to maximize their power. For realists, the end of the Cold War and collapse of the Soviet Union meant the U.S. was the sole remaining superpower. From this perspective, the U.S. should pursue realist policies aimed at preserving its primacy and shaping the world to suit its interests. This could include unilateral military interventions, coercion, and hard power to advance U.S. interests. The realist approach was evident in the early post-Cold War years under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, with interventions in Panama, Iraq, and the Balkans.

In contrast, liberalism sees the possibility of cooperation and shared gains between states within a rule-based international order. Liberals believe states' interests are shaped by domestic and international factors. In the post-Cold War context, liberals argued the U.S. should use its power to promote democracy, free trade, and multilateral institutions as the basis for a liberal world order that benefits all nations. Policies flowing from liberalism included expanding free trade deals like NAFTA, strengthening alliances like NATO, and promoting democracy and human rights.

However, the realist perspective failed to recognize the limitations of American power and the role of non-material factors in foreign policy. Not all regions were strategically or economically valuable to warrant costly interventions on realist logic alone. Similarly, the U.S. lacked the resources and legitimacy to coercively shape the domestic politics of other nations in its own image. Liberal policies also faced difficulties as the spread of democracy and free trade were uneven, and multilateral cooperation was hard to achieve.

Both realism and liberalism thus provided useful but imperfect guides for American power after the Cold War. An optimal policy required balancing realism's focus on interests with liberalism's consideration of values and institutions; recognizing both the possibilities for cooperation and the realities of competition in the international system; and accounting for domestic influences and international constraints on the exercise of U.S. power. The complex realities of the post-Cold War world meant that no single theory could comprehensively explain international politics or prescribe foreign policy. A balanced perspective was needed to match policy ambitions with actual power and legitimacy.

In summary, there is a clear link between theory and policy, as prescriptions for U.S. power after the Cold War were informed by realist and liberal theories. However, the realist interpretation failed to recognize key limitations and complexities. An effective policy required a balanced approach that synthesized insights from multiple theories. Policy makers thus had to reconcile contrasting visions of U.S. leadership to craft pragmatic strategies for the new global era.
