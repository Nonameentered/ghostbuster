Design for a Compact Two-Stage Gearbox for an Electric Drill

An electric drill requires a compact yet robust gearbox to provide speed reduction from the high-speed motor to the low-speed chuck. For a drill with specifications of 36W power at 9000rpm motor speed and 25:1 total reduction, a two-stage epicyclic gearbox with plastic gears in the first stage and phosphor bronze gears in the second stage can provide an optimized design.

The first stage sun gear should have a minimum of 16 teeth based on the module of 1.0 to provide adequate contact and meshing with the planet gears. More teeth would increase the diameter of the sun gear and make the gearbox less compact, while fewer teeth would compromise strength and load-carrying ability. With a sun gear of 16 teeth and module 1.0, the sun gear would have a pitch diameter of 16mm. Selecting plastic such as nylon for the first stage planet gears and carrier would reduce weight and cost relative to metal while still handling the torque requirement at the higher input speed. Nylon gears would require a diametral pitch of approximately 16 to handle the input power, giving planet gears with 10 to 12 teeth to mesh properly with the sun gear. The exact numbers of planet gears and carrier arms can be adjusted to provide smooth power transmission and even load distribution.

The second stage would provide finer reduction using stronger phosphor bronze gears to handle the higher torque at lower speed. A sun gear of 12 teeth would reduce the speed by a ratio of 12/16 = 0.75, giving a total stage one reduction of (16 â€“ 12)/16 = 25% from input to intermediate shaft. The second stage planetary gears would also require a diametral pitch of 16, with planet gears having 8 to 10 teeth to properly mesh with the smaller sun gear. The exact tooth numbers can again be adjusted to optimize the design. With a 12 tooth sun and two 10-tooth planets, the second stage would further reduce speed by a ratio of 10/12 = 0.833 from intermediate shaft to the output, for a total second stage reduction of 0.833 x 4 or 200:100 total from input to chuck, providing 25:1 total reduction as specified.

Comparison to commercial units shows this approach is typical, with two stages of epicyclic gearing using plastic components at higher speeds and stronger bronze or steel components at lower speeds where more torque is transmitted. This design provides a good balance of compactness, efficiency, and strength for the specified power and speed range. 

For the axial bearing arrangement, at the maximum thrust load from the user, a pair of angular contact ball bearings would absorb the thrust and separate the input and output shafts. The ball bearings permit high speed operation with low friction, and their angular contact design provides high axial load capacity and rigidity for good power transmission. The ball bearings would mount within a die cast housing that maintains bearing spacing and alignment and adapts to the internal shape of the drill housing.

Overall, this essay outlines a feasible compact gearbox design using a two-stage epicyclic gear reduction approach with plastic and phosphor bronze gears to achieve a 25:1 speed reduction in an electric drill. The design is compared to commercial gearboxes and includes an axial bearing system to handle thrust loads. With some adjustments in the exact tooth counts and planet gear quantities, this provides an optimized high-performance yet cost-effective solution to the design problem.
