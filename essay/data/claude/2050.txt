Here is a 1250 word essay in response to the prompt:

In his essay “Stonehenge Revisited,” Christopher Whittle argues that Stonehenge should be studied primarily as a phenomenological experience, rather than an object of archaeological or historical inquiry. Whittle contends that the meaning and power of Stonehenge lies in the raw experience of the monument itself, unencumbered by scientific or historical explanations.

Whittle begins by criticizing the approach that archaeologists and historians have traditionally taken to understand Stonehenge. He argues that their obsessive focus on determining the monument's purpose or chronology has obscured the sheer power of experiencing the stones as physical objects in space. All of the intellectual frameworks we impose on Stonehenge—whether druidic, Christian, or New Age—ultimately limit and constrain our experience of the monument. Whittle calls instead for an approach centered on direct, unmediated perception and encounter with the stones.

To advance his argument, Whittle draws on the philosophical tradition of phenomenology. Phenomenology focuses on the immediate experience of phenomena as they appear to consciousness, rather than abstract explanations or interpretations of them. Whittle argues that when we bracket off everything we think we know about Stonehenge's history and purpose, we can encounter the monument through our raw perceptual experience. We notice the monumental size and strange shapes of the stones, feel dwarfed by them, sense their mass, texture, and arrangement in space. Apprehending Stonehenge in this way, Whittle argues, we can grasp its primordial meaning and significance. Our intellectual concepts fade away and we perceive the power and mystery that our ancestors likely felt. 

Whittle's phenomenological approach thus offers an alternative to the standard archaeological perspective on Stonehenge. Rather than studying the monument as an artifact to be explained, Whittle proposes experiencing it as a phenomenon that is meaningful in itself. His essay challenges us to rediscover the numinous power of Stonehenge through direct and unmediated perception. By encountering its stark material reality, massive stones, and strange circular form, we can perceive the monument's deepest meaning without relying on any conceptual or explanatory apparatus. For Whittle, this is the most authentic way to understand why Stonehenge was built and why it continues to captivate our imagination today.

In summary, Whittle argues for a phenomenological rather than archaeological approach to Stonehenge. He maintains that perceiving and encountering the monument without mediation or preconception reveals its primordial power and significance. His essay challenges conventional modes of understanding Stonehenge by calling us to rediscover the raw perceptual experience of the monument itself.
