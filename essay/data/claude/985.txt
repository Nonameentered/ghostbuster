There are several theories and factors that influence motivation in the workplace. Understanding these theories and factors can help managers create the conditions to motivate their employees to work together towards a common goal. 

One of the most well-known theories of motivation is Maslow's hierarchy of needs. This theory proposes that people have a hierarchy of needs, from basic physiological needs at the bottom to self-actualization at the top. As lower-level needs are met, people are motivated by higher-level needs. In the workplace, this means that employees will be motivated by pay and benefits to meet their basic needs, but once satisfied, they will be motivated by higher order needs like a sense of belonging, esteem, and ultimately self-actualization through meaningful work. Managers should ensure they are meeting employees' basic needs while also emphasizing higher-level motivators.

Another key theory is Herzberg's two-factor theory, which distinguishes between motivator factors, such as challenging work and recognition, that motivate employees from hygiene factors, such as pay and job security, that can lead to job dissatisfaction if missing but do not actually motivate. According to this theory, managers should focus on motivator factors to encourage motivation. They can do this through providing employees with meaningful, challenging work opportunities, recognizing their achievements, giving them more responsibility, and fostering opportunities for growth.  

Other factors also drive motivation in the workplace. Employees are more motivated when they feel they have autonomy over their work, believe in the significance of their work, and feel competent at their jobs. Relationships and connections with colleagues also motivate employees. Managers should aim to create conditions where employees experience autonomy, meaning, and competence in their roles and build a sense of community and teamwork.

Managers can take several actions to motivate their employees and encourage them to work together towards a common goal based on these theories and factors:

•Ensure all employees' basic needs for pay, benefits, work-life balance, job security, etc. are met according to Maslow's hierarchy. But also emphasize higher-order motivators like providing meaningful work, opportunities for growth, and recognition.

•Focus on motivator factors like challenging/meaningful work, opportunities for growth, recognition and responsibility according to Herzberg's theory. Minimize hygiene factors as far as possible. 

•Give employees autonomy over how they do their work and make significant decisions according to their areas of expertise. Help them understand the significance and meaning in their roles. Provide training and mentorship to build competence.

•Build a sense of community via team-building efforts, collaboration, and strong internal communications. Foster positive relationships and connections between coworkers. 

•Develop a shared common goal or vision and communicate how each employee contributes to it. Employees will be more motivated when they believe in the goal and understand their part in achieving it. 

•Recognize individuals and teams when key milestones are achieved. This positive reinforcement will motivate employees to continue moving towards the ultimate goal.

In summary, there are many theories and factors that drive motivation at work. When managers understand these drivers of motivation and implement strategies to address them, they can create a motivating environment for their employees and encourage them to work together productively for shared goals. The key is meeting both lower-level and higher-level needs, building community and relationships, creating meaningful and engaging work, and reinforcing progress. With the right approach, managers can cultivate a motivated, collaborative team.
