Induction is the process of reasoning from observations of particular events to general laws and claims. It involves moving from specific instances to general rules and patterns. In a scientific context, induction is the key method by which theories and laws are developed based on experimental evidence. Francis Bacon promoted an empirical approach to science based on inductive reasoning from observations. According to Bacon, by collecting a large number of observations about the natural world, one could discern the underlying causal mechanisms and identify fundamental laws of nature.  

Bacon proposed an inductive "scientific method" involving accumulating observations, tabulating them, and identifying the common patterns. He argued that this method could overcome biases and preconceptions, leading to new scientific insights. However, Bacon's inductive method has been criticized on several grounds. Most notably, the problem of induction poses a challenge. The fact that we have observed something to occur in a particular way multiple times in the past does not logically entail that it will continue to occur that way in the future or in unobserved cases. As Hume argued, inductive reasoning cannot yield certainty. At best, it leads to probabilistic claims.

While the Baconian model of pure induction from observations is flawed, induction coupled with deduction remains pivotal to scientific progress. Scientists do make observations of particular events, but they also bring theoretical assumptions, models, and hypotheses to bear in interpreting those observations. Induction and deduction operate together in an iterative manner. Deduction allows scientists to derive testable predictions from theories and hypotheses. By testing those predictions through experiments and observations, scientists can then use inductive reasoning to evaluate the validity of the theories or suggest ways in which they need to be modified or replaced.

For example, in developing his theory of universal gravitation, Newton relied on a combination of inductive and deductive reasoning. He made inductive inferences from observations, like the falling of objects to Earth and the orbits of the planets, to propose his law of universal gravitation. But he also used deductive logic to derive more precise predictions from this law, which were then tested through experiments and further observations. The predictive success of Newton's theory provided inductive evidence for its validity. 

In sum, while Bacon's model of pure induction from observations is flawed, inductive and deductive reasoning together drive scientific progress. Induction allows scientists to develop theories and laws from patterns in observations and experimental data. Deduction allows logical derivation of predictions from theories that can then be tested through further experiments, enabling inductive evaluation and refinement. The combination of evidence from induction and prediction from deduction gives science its characteristic hypothetico-deductive methodology. Induction will always remain somewhat problematic due to the 'problem of induction,' but coupled with deduction, it provides a powerful means for developing and testing scientific laws and theories.
