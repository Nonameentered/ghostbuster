Management of acute asthma attacks requires consideration of multiple factors, including the use of oxygen, bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Oxygen should be administered in cases of low oxygen saturation levels, which provides quick relief to the patient. Bronchodilators such as short-acting beta-agonists are used to relax and open the airways, making it easier to breathe. They can be administered either in nebulized or inhaler form. Oral or intravenous corticosteroids are used to reduce airway inflammation, but they require time to take effect so are often used in conjunction with bronchodilators for acute attacks. Antibiotics are only used if there are signs of infection and are not routinely given for all asthma attacks.

Prompt diagnosis and treatment of acute asthma exacerbations are critical to successful management and improving outcomes and reducing morbidity. An individualized asthma action plan created between the patient and physician helps the patient recognize warning signs of an upcoming attack and how to appropriately respond and manage it, including which medications to use. Education about possible triggers and how to avoid them also helps in preventing attacks and promoting self-management. The action plan also specifies at what point emergency services should be contacted based on lack of improvement or worsening symptoms. Having this plan in place empowers patients and gives them the knowledge and confidence to effectively self-manage their condition, which in turn can help prevent exacerbations and reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. It may also help reduce anxiety about asthma which can worsen symptoms.

With proper education and an asthma action plan in place, patients can identify an attack in its early stages and immediately start appropriate treatment as directed by their action plan. This may include using an additional dose or doses of a quick-relief inhaler, starting an oral corticosteroid if prescribed, and avoiding potential triggers. The patient should monitor their symptoms and peak flow readings to determine if they are improving with initial interventions or if emergency care becomes necessary due to lack of improvement or worsening conditions. Close follow up with the patient's physician after an attack is also important to determine if any adjustments need to be made to the long-term asthma control medications or action plan.  

In summary, key factors in managing acute asthma attacks are prompt diagnosis, administration of oxygen and bronchodilators, corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, antibiotics only if signs of infection are present, an individualized asthma action plan for guidance on self-management, patient education about triggers and warning signs, and close physician follow up after an attack to prevent future exacerbations. By properly educating patients and providing them with personalized asthma management plans, physicians can promote better self-management techniques, improve quality of life, and reduce the frequency and severity of asthma attacks.
