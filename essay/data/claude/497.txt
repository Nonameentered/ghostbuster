Here is a 1250 word essay on the factors impacting fiscal policy effectiveness and how they can be analyzed:

Fiscal policy refers to the government's taxing and spending policies used to influence the economy. The government can implement fiscal stimulus during an economic downturn by increasing spending or cutting taxes to boost aggregate demand. Conversely, the government can raise taxes and cut spending during an economic expansion to slow growth and reduce inflationary pressures. However, there are several factors that determine the effectiveness of fiscal policy, including the size of policy changes relative to the size of the overall economy, the leakage effects, timing issues, and crowding out.

The size of fiscal policy changes relative to the overall economy matters because small changes may not substantially impact the economy, especially a large economy. The impact depends on the fiscal multiplier, which indicates how much economic output changes in response to a fiscal policy change. The larger the multiplier, the bigger the impact. The multiplier depends on factors like the marginal propensity to consume, tax rates, and import shares. During a downturn, the multiplier is often larger, so fiscal stimulus has a bigger impact. Fiscal policies also need to be sizable enough to counteract the major forces driving the business cycle. Modest stimulus may be inadequate if there are large negative shocks to the economy.

Leakage effects refer to how much of a fiscal expansion leaks out of the economy through increased imports or personal saving rather than spending. If a large fraction leaks out, the impact on aggregate demand will be smaller. Imports depend on factors like the marginal propensity to import and the degree of openness. Personal saving depends on households' marginal propensity to save, which in turn depends on their lifetime income, uncertainty, and expectations. During downturns, leakages tend to be smaller as people spend more on domestic goods and draw down savings. 

Timing is also crucial. Policy changes need to be implemented quickly during downturns before more damage is done. But policy changes also need to be timed so that their peak impact coincides with the trough of the business cycle. Poor timing can lead to a delayed impact, potentially exacerbating the cycle. Fiscal policy changes often face implementation lags due to the political process and bureaucracy. Automatic stabilizers like unemployment benefits that kick in immediately can help address timing issues.

Finally, crowding out can reduce the effectiveness of fiscal expansion. Increased government borrowing can push up interest rates, crowding out private investment spending. Private investment then falls, offsetting some of the demand stimulus. Crowding out depends on factors like the amount of deficit spending, the supply of loanable funds in the economy, and monetary policy. During downturns, crowding out effects are usually smaller as interest rates are low, and the central bank may implement accommodative policy.  

In summary, the size of policy changes, leakage effects, timing issues, and crowding out are all factors that determine how effectively fiscal policy can stabilize the economy. These factors can be analyzed using economic models that incorporate measures like the fiscal multiplier, marginal propensities, interest rate effects, and monetary policy relationships. Such analyses provide insights into crafting the appropriate fiscal policy response depending on the state of the economy.
