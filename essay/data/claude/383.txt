Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder that causes severe damage to the lungs and digestive system. It is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene which provides instructions for making a protein that controls the movement of salt and water into and out of cells. The most common mutation is known as Î”F508, which results in the CFTR protein not being properly made and transported to the cell surface. Without functional CFTR protein, secretions in the lungs and pancreas become thick and sticky, leading to frequent lung infections and poor absorption of nutrients. 

CF is diagnosed through a combination of genetic testing and clinical evaluations. Newborn screening using a blood test can detect high levels of a chemical called immunoreactive trypsinogen, which indicates CF may be present. A sweat test is then conducted to measure levels of salt in the sweat - unusually high salt levels confirm the diagnosis of CF. Carrier testing and prenatal screening are also available to detect CF mutations before a child is born.

The pathophysiology of CF begins in the lungs and pancreas. In the lungs, thick mucus clogs the airways and provides an ideal environment for bacterial growth, leading to chronic infections and inflammation that damage lung tissue over time. In the pancreas, the thick secretions block the release of digestive enzymes and bicarbonate that help neutralize stomach acid. This results in malnutrition, poor growth, and malnutrition-related diabetes in CF patients.

The clinical presentation of CF includes respiratory problems, digestive difficulties, and other complications. Patients experience persistent cough with thick phlegm, frequent chest colds, and pneumonia.  They also suffer from poor absorption of nutrients, bulky stools, abdominal pain, and bloating. Over time, CF can lead to more severe lung disease, diabetes, cirrhosis of the liver, and infertility in men. The prognosis depends on the severity of symptoms and availability of treatment. The median life expectancy is 37 years for people with CF.

There is no cure for CF, but treatments help relieve symptoms and reduce complications. The most common therapy involves a combination of medications, dietary supplements, and physiotherapy. Bronchodilators and inhaled steroids are used to open airways and reduce inflammation. Enzymes and fat-soluble vitamins are taken with meals to improve nutrient absorption. Physiotherapy techniques include chest percussion and exercise to clear mucus from the lungs. Dietary changes also help provide adequate nutrition - patients need to consume more calories, protein, and salt. Oxygen therapy and lung transplants may be required for end-stage lung disease. 

Living with CF requires extensive daily therapy and lifestyle adjustments which can be taxing. Patients spend hours performing physiotherapy, taking medications, and preparing specialized meals. This frequent medical care and dietary vigilance can disrupt school, work, and social activities. Coping with the uncertainty of health decline and shortened life expectancy also takes an emotional toll on both patients and their families. However, many people with CF lead remarkably normal and productive lives, especially with advances in treatment.

Research on CF continues to make progress on multiple fronts. Gene therapies to treat the underlying cause of CF are showing promise in clinical trials but remain experimental. New medications targeting CFTR mutations are being developed and tested. Improved technology can better detect lung disease, allowing for earlier intervention. Advancements in lung transplants, infection control, and nutrition also help patients live longer, healthier lives. Overall, the outlook is optimistic due to dedicated research efforts and a growing arsenal of tools to fight cystic fibrosis.
