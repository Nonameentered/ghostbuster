Postmodern literature is characterized by a rejection of traditional grand narratives and a skepticism regarding uniform truths. Postmodern texts challenge conventional expectations about self, identity, and character. Rather than portraying characters as unified subjects with a fixed, essential identity, postmodern texts depict the self as decentralized and fragmented. Characters often represent this postmodern dissolution of a coherent self through their multiple, conflicting personalities and their lack of a definitive character arc. 

Two postmodern texts that exemplify this challenge to traditional notions of identity and character are Rudolfo Anaya’s Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid and Iain Banks’ The Crow Road. In Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, the character of Billy the Kid has a fluid and ambiguous identity. The text presents multiple, conflicting origin stories for Billy, undermining the idea that he has a single, knowable “true” self. For example, one account suggests Billy was orphaned as a baby and raised by a Mexican family, while another claims he is the son of respectable English parents. This plurality of identities resists a fixed notion of Billy’s “actual” background and selfhood.

Furthermore, Billy’s character lacks a clear progression or narrative trajectory. Whereas traditional protagonists follow a character arc of development and change, culminating in a climactic moment of achievement or realization,Billy’s journey feels aimless and inconclusive. He drifts through adventures and encounters without a defined purpose or destination. By denying Billy a sense of coherent identity or clear character arc, the text portrays him as a postmodern subject: fragmented, unfixed, and decentered.

Similarly, in The Crow Road, characters resist singular or straightforward identities. The character Rory travels through identities, expressing himself differently based on the social circles he moves in, undermining the notion of a unified self. For example, around his friends he is rebellious and cocksure but around his girlfriend he is awkward and self-doubting. Like Billy the Kid, Rory lacks a clear character progression or purpose, simply drifting through post-adolescence without direction or a defined identity.

The postmodern conception of identity as fluid and multifarious is also expressed through the structure and content of The Crow Road. The narrative jumps across decades and perspectives, resisting a linear structure with a single viewpoint. This fragmentation reinforces the text’s postmodern sensibility that identity and truth are plural, complex, and resistant to neat categories or grand narratives.

In conclusion, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid and The Crow Road exemplify postmodern literature’s subversion of traditional identity and character. Through Billy the Kid and Rory, the texts depict selves as fluid, unfixed, and aimless rather than defined by a single, progressive character arc. The decentered and plural narratives of the texts mirror their conception of identity as multifarious rather than singular. By challenging conventions of character and identity, these postmodern works reflect the postmodern recognition that selves and truths are complex and diverse.
