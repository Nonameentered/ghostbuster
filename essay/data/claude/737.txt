Here is a 250-word essay in response to the prompt:

Outsourcing elements of a company's supply chain and manufacturing processes can have a significant impact on supply chain management. On the positive side, outsourcing can reduce costs, enable focus on core competencies, and gain access to specialized skills. However, it also brings risks like loss of control, quality issues, and increased supply chain complexity. 

Companies must carefully evaluate which parts of their supply chain to outsource based on factors like cost, quality, intellectual property concerns, and proximity to end customers. A structured decision-making framework can help determine what should stay in-house versus outsource. Once the decision is made to outsource, companies must closely manage outsourcing partners through activities like site visits, performance metrics, and frequent communication.

Regarding lean versus agile supply chain strategies, companies must choose an approach that fits their unique marketplace and products. The lean model focuses on efficiency, waste reduction, and cost savings. It is best suited for stable, predictable demand. The agile model focuses on flexibility, adaptability, and customer responsiveness. It is optimal for volatile, uncertain environments. 

Some companies may employ a hybrid "leagile" model, applying lean principles to non-critical areas and agile principles to areas where flexibility is vital. The key is understanding which approach - lean, agile, or hybrid - is right for each part of the supply chain based on variables like product life cycle, demand predictability, and competitive dynamics.

In summary, outsourcing carries both significant benefits and risks that companies must thoughtfully manage. Choosing between lean and agile supply chain strategies depends on market characteristics and aligning the appropriate approach to each area of the supply chain. With strategic decision making, outsourcing and supply chain optimization can provide a competitive advantage.
