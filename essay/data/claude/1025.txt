Here is a draft 1500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Business-IT alignment refers to the degree to which the information technology mission, objectives, and plans support and are supported by the business mission, objectives, and plans. Achieving strong alignment between business and IT is critical for organizations to gain a competitive advantage. When business and IT are aligned, IT is able to enable and drive business strategy rather than just support it. This allows organizations to leverage IT for innovation and gain a competitive advantage. 

Research shows that organizations with strong business-IT alignment outperform other organizations on key measures such as profitability, productivity, and customer service. Henderson and Venkatraman articulated one of the earliest strategic alignment models, suggesting the importance of both strategic fit and functional integration between business and IT. Luftman built upon this by identifying key enablers of alignment including IT governance, relationship, and communications. These enablers highlight the fact that alignment is a multi-dimensional, dynamic capability which requires continuous work and adaptation.

The necessity of alignment has only increased as IT has become commoditized and embedded in all parts of organizations. With cloud computing, software as a service, and other trends, IT capabilities are more available and affordable than ever before. This makes IT alone an insufficient means of gaining competitive advantageâ€”instead, the key is harnessing IT in a tightly aligned way to support business needs. Measuring the degree of alignment, however, remains challenging due to its multi-dimensional nature. Surveys, maturity models, and KPIs can all be used to assess alignment, but must account for its complexity. 

In summary, business-IT alignment is crucial for enabling IT to contribute to and drive business success. When business and IT operate in harmony, IT can move from a supporting role to a leading role in which it catalyzes innovation and competitive advantage. Achieving high levels of alignment is challenging but also increasingly necessary as IT becomes more ubiquitous and commoditized. Organizations that make the continuous effort to measure, assess, and improve their business-IT alignment are best positioned to harness the power of IT for success.
