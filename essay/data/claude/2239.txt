The de Broglie-Bohm pilot wave theory is an alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics that proposes particles have defined locations and follow determinate particle trajectories. This stands in contrast to the Copenhagen interpretation which suggests particles do not have defined locations and paths until they are measured. The key difference between the two interpretations can be illustrated by how they explain the results of the famous double slit experiment.

In the double slit experiment, single particles, such as electrons, are fired at a plate with two closely spaced narrow slits. On the other side of the slits is a screen that detects where the particles land. According to the Copenhagen interpretation, the particles do not have a determined path or location as they travel through the slits. Their wavefunction, which describes the probability of finding a particle at any position, interferes with itself, creating an interference pattern on the screen. It is only when the particles are detected on the screen that their location becomes defined. The interference pattern builds up over time as many particles are detected, showing the wave-like behavior of quantum objects.  

The pilot wave theory, on the other hand, proposes that particles have defined paths that are guided by pilot waves. The pilot wave is a wavefunction that travels through both slits, interfering with itself and creating an interference pattern. The particle is guided by the pilot wave, and its trajectory is influenced by the interference pattern. While the particle only goes through one slit, its motion is correlated with the pilot wave going through both slits. The buildup of many particles on the screen reveals the interference pattern created by the pilot waves. In essence, there is a wave-particle duality with the wavefunction acting as a pilot wave that guides the particles. 

The key difference lies in whether particles have defined locations and paths before measurement. The Copenhagen interpretation suggests they do not, whereas the pilot wave theory proposes they do have defined trajectories, even if they are not precisely determined. Under the Copenhagen view, particles go through both slits as waves, but are detected as particles on the screen. The pilot wave theory posits that particles go through one slit but are guided to an interference pattern by pilot waves going through both slits. 

The double slit experiment has been performed with increasingly larger particles, all the way up to molecules with over 800 atoms. The results continue to show interference patterns, suggesting wave-like behavior for even very massive particles. Proponents of the Copenhagen view interpret this as evidence that even large particles lack defined positions and paths until measured. Supporters of the pilot wave theory argue that the interference arises from the interaction of particles with pilot waves, not because the particles themselves travel through both slits. While controversial, the pilot wave theory provides an intuitively appealing deterministic interpretation of quantum mechanics that yields the same predictions as the Copenhagen interpretation.
