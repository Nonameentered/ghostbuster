Here is a 250-word essay on automobile manufacturing 'cash cow' firms using Peugeot Motor Company Ltd and other large firms as examples:

The automobile manufacturing industry is dominated by large firms that have established brands and a sizable market share, making them 'cash cows' that generate predictable revenue and profits. One such firm is Peugeot Motor Company Ltd, UK which produces over 2 million vehicles annually and has a 10% market share in Western Europe. 

Peugeot recorded £16 billion in revenue in 2018, behind other major players like Toyota Motor Manufacturing with £22 billion, General Motors with £30 billion, and Iveco France SA at £10 billion. A pie chart showing each firm’s market share in Western Europe's automobile market highlights Peugeot and GM each with 10%, Toyota with 15% and Iveco with 5%. These four companies comprise 40% of the total market.

While these firms are leaders in the industry, competition is fierce to gain more market share and increase annual turnover. Peugeot has launched new SUV models to capture more customers, Toyota emphasizes technological innovation and quality to justify price premiums, GM owns multiple brands to appeal to wider ranges of buyers, and Iveco is expanding into new markets. However, the automobile market is maturing in developed economies, so significant gains in market share will likely come at the expense of competitors.

Overall, major automobile manufacturers like Peugeot, Toyota, GM and Iveco have substantial and stable market shares which provide predictable cash flows, qualifying them as ‘cash cows.’ They continue to invest in new products, brands and markets to strengthen their positions, even as the broader industry growth slows. These actions reflect the competitive dynamics between the largest firms in a mature industry striving to defend their shares of a lucrative market.
