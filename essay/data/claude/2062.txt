Here is a 1750 word essay in response to the prompt:

The soft fruit market in Poland faces several significant challenges. First, the Polish soft fruit industry has been historically characterized by low productivity and yields compared to other major European producers. According to statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization, Poland's raspberry and redcurrant yields are 30-40% lower than the European average. Strawberry yields are 50% lower. Low productivity stems from small farm sizes, lack of investment in technology and innovation, and limited knowledge about modern growing techniques among farmers. 

Second, the Polish soft fruit industry struggles with limited export activity and dependence on the domestic market. Over 90% of Poland's soft fruit production is sold domestically. While the domestic market is sizeable, future growth will depend on increasing exports. However, Polish soft fruits face high transportation costs due to the country's geographical location in Central Europe as well as strong competition on export markets from countries with higher productivity and lower costs of production.

A third key challenge is price instability and volatility. Soft fruit prices in Poland fluctuate significantly from year to year based on fluctuations in yields and quality. Price drops can be devastating for farmers. For example, raspberry producers faced a 50% drop in prices from 2017 to 2018 due to a large oversupply in the market. Such price volatility reduces profitability and investment in the sector.

To address these challenges, Poland has implemented several measures under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). First, Poland provides subsidies for on-farm investments through the CAP's Rural Development Program. These subsidies co-finance the acquisition of new machinery, equipment, irrigation systems, and other technologies aimed at improving productivity, quality, and yields. They also support farmer training and knowledge transfer.

Second, the CAP provides subsidies for the establishment of producer groups and organizations. These groups help strengthen farmers' market power, improve planning and forecasting to avoid oversupply crises, and coordinate exports. Poland has actively supported the establishment of several soft fruit producer organizations in recent years.  

Finally, the CAP provides funding for targeted export promotion of soft fruits including participation in trade fairs and exhibitions, trade missions, and marketing campaigns in foreign markets. The goal is to raise the profile of Polish soft fruit, establish new trade contacts, and diversify export destinations. Export subsidies are especially helpful for small-scale producers that could not otherwise afford to participate in such activities.

In conclusion, the Polish soft fruit sector faces productivity, export, and price challenges. The CAP provides subsidies and support for on-farm investments, cooperation in producer organizations, and export promotion to help address these challenges. Continued modernization, improved forecasting and planning, development of export markets, and close cooperation between producers and government will be needed to strengthen the competitiveness of Poland's soft fruit industry.
