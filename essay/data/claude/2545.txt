How does the diplomatic methods of Russian foreign policy after the end of the Cold War reflect domestic interests, and what are the patterns in those methods? 

After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia embarked on a new chapter of its foreign policy that was no longer defined by competition with the West in a bi-polar global order. However, Russia's foreign policy actions in the post-Cold War era have still been largely shaped by its domestic politics and a desire to protect its national interests. There are several distinct patterns that can be observed in Russia's diplomatic methods during this period.

First, Russia sought to maintain its influence over former Soviet states and resist expansion of Western alliances like NATO into its traditional sphere of influence. Russia opposed NATO enlargement to include former Soviet states, seeing it as a threat to its security interests. When former Soviet states sought to join Western alliances, Russia often responded with shows of force, economic pressure, and support for Russian-backed separatist movements. For example, Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 to oppose its NATO bid, and Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backs pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine's east following a pro-Western revolution. These actions aim to reassert Russia's influence in its neighborhood and push back on Western encroachment into former Soviet space.

Second, Russia aimed to be recognized as a global superpower and influential player on the world stage alongside the United States and Western nations. Russia sought a "multi-polar" global order rather than Western dominance. To raise its prestige, Russia hosted global events like the 2014 Sochi Olympics and 2018 FIFA World Cup, intervened in the Syrian Civil War to prop up the Assad regime, and courted developing nations through arms sales, investment, and diplomatic overtures. Russia's interventions in Ukraine and Syria also projected an image of Russia as a dominant military power defending its interests abroad. These actions reflected Russia's desire for global prestige and influence matching its self-image as a great power.

Finally, Vladimir Putin centralized control over foreign policymaking to strengthen his own power and cult of personality. As president, Putin took control of key foreign policy decisions and appointed loyalists as foreign minister to exert dominance. His macho persona was cultivated through shows of strength on the world stage.  Foreign policy victories and interventions benefited Putin domestically by rallying Russians around the flag and portraying Putin as restoring Russia's strength. In this way, Russian foreign policy directly served Putin's aims to consolidate authoritarian control and popular support within Russia.

In conclusion, Russian foreign policy since 1991 has reflected the desire to protect Russia's security interests in its neighborhood, raise Russia's standing as a global superpower, and benefit Vladimir Putin's control over power at home. Through interventions abroad and opposition to Western powers, Putin's Russia has pursued its national interests while also bolstering his own cult of personality within Russia. The patterns of reasserting dominance over former Soviet states, courting global prestige, and centralizing control around Vladimir Putin are all means of serving Russia's domestic political priorities in the post-Cold War era.
