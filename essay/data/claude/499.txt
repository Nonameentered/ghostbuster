There are several factors contributing to the increasing inequality seen in the world today:

 Technology & Automation: Technological changes and automation are disproportionately benefiting highly skilled and educated workers, while replacing many routine jobs. This “hollowing out” of middle-income jobs is exacerbating inequality. Many new jobs being created require high levels of technical education and skills that much of the population does not have access to. As automation spreads to new sectors, inequality may widen further if large parts of the population cannot upgrade their skills fast enough. Education systems need to adapt to help populations gain technical and critical thinking skills that will be required for the jobs of the future.

Globalization & Trade: Globalization has lifted millions out of poverty in developing countries through increased trade and connectivity, but it has also hurt certain groups. In developed countries, open trade has put downward pressure on wages for low-skilled workers who now compete with cheap labor from abroad. At the same time, highly skilled and educated workers have benefited from global markets and supply chains. Global tax systems and policies have also made it easier for large corporations and the wealthy to avoid taxes by shifting assets to low-tax jurisdictions. Closing loopholes in global tax laws and providing wage insurance or job retraining for displaced workers could help address these inequities.

 Institutions & Social Infrastructure: In many countries, economic and political institutions disproportionately benefit elite groups, while restricting opportunity and mobility for others. unequal access to resources like education, healthcare, infrastructure, and finance perpetuates poverty and inequality across generations. Changes to institutions and social infrastructure - like access to healthcare and education, secure property rights, functioning democracy and rule of law, and access to finance - are very difficult to achieve but can have an enormous impact on economic growth and development over the long run.

Inequality is a complex global challenge with no simple or single solution. With economic forces like technology and trade increasing inequality, social infrastructure and institutions are critical to promoting equitable access to opportunity. Global convergence and reducing international inequality are possible but will require a multifaceted approach. Adequately funding public services like healthcare and education, re-distributing resources and wealth through fair tax policies, providing strong social safety nets, promoting access to finance, and protecting the rights and fair treatment of marginalized groups are all important tools that, when combined, can help create a more just and equitable society. Progress will be slow, but global cooperation and open dialogue on these issues can help move nations in a direction of increased equality and shared prosperity.
