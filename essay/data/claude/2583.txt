UHT milk, or ultra-heat treatment milk, is milk that has been heated to very high temperatures for a short period of time to kill dangerous bacteria and increase its shelf life. Unlike pasteurized milk which is heated to 161 F for 15 seconds, UHT milk is heated to 280 F for 2 seconds using a direct heating method. This extreme heat treatment allows UHT milk to be shelf stable for 6-12 months without refrigeration as it kills nearly all bacteria and spores that can spoil the milk or cause disease.

The direct heating method used to produce UHT milk involves running the milk through a series of heat exchangers to quickly bring it up to the target temperature before cooling it back down. The milk is first preheated using heat recovered from the cooling process. It is then heated using high-pressure steam in a plate heat exchanger and held at the ultra-high temperature for a few seconds as it flows through holding tubes. The milk is then rapidly cooled using a vacuum cooler to remove the excess heat. This direct heating method allows for very precise control and monitoring of the time-temperature profile compared to indirect heating using steam infusion or steam injection heating methods. 

The quality of UHT milk is comparable to raw milk in terms of nutrition but the high heat does result in some differences. The protein structure can be slightly altered, and there is usually a small loss of certain heat-sensitive vitamins like C and thiamine. However, UHT milk still retains most of the nutritional value of raw milk and is considered a good source of calcium, protein, B vitamins and minerals. The higher heat also results in a slightly cooked flavor due to the Maillard reaction between proteins and sugars, though many find this flavor difference minor.

The water content and concentration of UHT milk depends on controlling several factors during production. The high heat causes some unavoidable evaporation of water, so condensation control is important to minimize water loss. The holding tube design, flow rate, and residence time control the time milk solids are exposed to high heat, impacting water loss, protein denaturation and other unwanted chemical reactions. Rapid cooling after heating is also critical to stop these chemical processes and lock in nutrition, flavor and mouthfeel. If not cooled quickly enough, UHT milk can develop a stale, oxidized flavor due to the breakdown of fats.

There are several advantages to using direct heating methods to produce UHT milk. Primarily, direct heating allows for very precise control of the time-temperature profile milk is exposed to, ensuring it reaches microbial stability without overheating. It also allows for efficient heat recovery to preheat incoming milk and produces a higher quality product with minimal nutrient loss or off-flavors when properly controlled. However, there are some disadvantages, including the high capital cost of equipment, and difficulty scaling up to high volume production. There is also a risk of fouling heat exchangers which requires frequent cleaning, and the short residence time requires milk with minimal entrained air or very consistent fat globule size.

In summary, UHT milk is milk that has been briefly exposed to ultra-high heat to kill bacteria and increase shelf life. It is produced using a direct heating method involving a series of heat exchangers to rapidly bring milk to the target temperature before cooling. When controlled properly, direct heating can produce UHT milk with high quality, though the high heat does result in some minor nutritional and flavor changes compared to raw milk. Monitoring water loss, residence time, and rapid cooling are key to producing high quality UHT milk with direct heating methods.
