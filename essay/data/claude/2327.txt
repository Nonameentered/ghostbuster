Samian ware and shipwrecks provide valuable insights into the Roman economy, including trade networks, production scales, and consumer goods. However, there are also limitations and unanswered questions regarding how representative they are of larger economic patterns. 

Samian ware, or terra sigillata, were high-quality glossy red-slip ceramics produced at industrial scales in Gaul and other western Roman provinces. The widespread distribution of samian ware across the Roman world indicates the existence of extensive trade networks that could transport fragile pottery over long distances. Archaeologists have analyzed samian ware stamps and forms to trace the flow of pottery from production centers to consumers, revealing connections between pottery workshops in Gaul and markets as far as Britain and the Danube.

At the same time, samian ware provides a narrow view of the Roman economy. It represents only one type of good, and its distribution may have been enabled by its high value and the resources of the state. The networks that carried samian ware may not reflect the full complexity of trade connections across the empire. In addition, samian ware studies provide limited information on the social and economic mechanisms driving its production and distribution. Further research on taxation, labor, and marketing practices could provide more context for understanding the place of samian ware in the broader Roman economy.

Shipwrecks offer another useful data source, preserving direct evidence for goods in transit across the Mediterranean. Analysis of shipwrecks has revealed details about shipping technology, trade routes, and the types of goods being transported, including olive oil, wine, glass, and metals. The quantity and contents of shipwrecks indicate the vast scale of seaborne trade and the connections between producers and consumers across the empire.

However, shipwreck data also has significant limitations. Preserved shipwrecks represent only a tiny fraction of actual ship traffic, so they may provide a misleading picture of trade volumes and routes. They offer little information on the social mechanisms of trade, including merchants, markets, and state policies shaping trade patterns. Shipwrecks also lack context on the overland trade networks and non-traded goods that made up much of the Roman economy.

In conclusion, while samian ware and shipwrecks provide useful data on Roman trade connections and the kinds of goods in circulation, there are many unanswered questions about the social and economic structures behind these patterns. Additional research on taxation, labor, marketing, and non-traded goods is needed to develop a full understanding of the Roman economy. These archaeological indicators should be combined with textual and theoretical evidence to address the complex workings of the economy as a whole.
