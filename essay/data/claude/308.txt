The analysis of exam performance typically relies on several types of data, including results from individual exam questions, overall exam scores, and background information about the students. Each data type has distinct features. These data are analyzed using quantitative methods to gain insights into student performance and opportunities for improvement.

Exam question results provide detailed information about how students fared on specific concepts and skills that were tested. For each question, the total number of points available and the percentage of students choosing each possible answer choice can be calculated. Questions where a high percentage of students chose the wrong answer may indicate concepts or skills that need further reinforcement or alternative ways of testing. Aggregating results across multiple questions on related concepts can also provide insights. These granular data can point to specific areas for improvement in teaching and learning. 

Overall exam scores for each student summarize their performance but lack the depth of detail found in the question-level data. However, exam scores can be correlated with other attributes such as student demographics, attendance, study hours, and past academic performance to gain insights into factors that may influence achievement. For example, comparing exam scores between demographic groups can reveal inequities that need to be addressed. Exam scores over multiple years can also show whether learning or teaching interventions are having the desired effect.

Background data about the students, such as demographics, program of study, attendance, and prior grades provide context for interpreting both question results and overall exam scores. For example, comparing performance across demographic groups allows analyzing whether all groups of students were equally well-prepared for the exam.  If not, extra support for certain groups may be needed. Tracking individual student performance on exams over time using their background data may reveal students who are improving or declining, informing the need for interventions.

A combination of quantitative methods, including statistics, data visualization, and data mining, are used to analyze these data. Statistics such as means, medians, standard deviations, and correlations help summarize performance and find patterns. Data visualizations like bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots provide an accessible overview of the data. Data mining techniques look for interesting relationships or segments in complex data that could go unnoticed otherwise. 

In summary, analyzing exam performance relies on a variety of data about questions, scores,  students and uses quantitative analytic techniques. The ultimate goal is gaining actionable insights that feed into improving student achievement, learning outcomes, and educational practices. Overall, data-driven analysis of exam results can be a powerful way to enhance student success.
