Discuss the figure of the virgin in ancient Greek mythology, paying particular attention to the virgin goddesses Athena, Hestia and Artemis and exploring their relevance in ancient Greek myth. 

The virgin goddess was a prominent trope in ancient Greek mythology. Three of the most significant virgin goddesses were Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war; Hestia, the goddess of the hearth and home; and Artemis, the goddess of the hunt and the moon. These goddesses represented purity, chastity and independence from male influence or control.

The virgin goddess embodied bodily integrity and purity. By remaining chaste and virginal, these goddesses maintained control and agency over their own bodies and sexuality. They were not defined by their relationships to men or by their fertility and motherhood as many mortal women and goddesses were. Their virginity symbolized strength, independence and autonomy.  

In contrast, male virgins were rare in Greek myth and represented passivity. For example, the hunter Actaeon accidentally saw the virgin goddess Artemis bathing naked. In retribution, Artemis turned him into a stag and he was torn apart by his own hounds. The myth suggests that a mortal male seeing a virgin goddess's nakedness, even accidentally, was an egregious transgression that demanded the harshest punishment. Male virginity did not inspire the same reverence and respect as female virginity in Greek myth.

The virgin goddesses often exemplified traditional gender roles for women as chaste, dutiful and homebound. However, they also subverted some expectations by acting as independent agents and leaders. For example, Athena advised heroes and led armies in war; Artemis hunted in the wild and fiercely defended her chastity. While virginity was highly valued, these goddesses showed that women could play active, rather than just passive, roles in Greek myth.

The virgin goddesses thus represented the tension between traditional gender roles and more progressive ideas of female power and agency in ancient Greece. Their virginity and bodily integrity signified purity, morality and domesticity which were traditionally female virtues. Yet they were also strong, autonomous beings who actively defended their chastity and independence. The virgin goddess was a complex figure who reinforced and challenged notions of gender in ancient Greek myth.

In conclusion, the virgin goddess occupied a multi-faceted role in Greek myth. She embodied ideals of female purity, morality and tradition but also represented strength, autonomy and a degree of independence from male authority. The significance of the virgin goddess demonstrates the nuances and contradictions in ideas of gender, sexuality and power in ancient Greek culture.
