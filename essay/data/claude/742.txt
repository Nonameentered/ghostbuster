What is the argument for Swing Time being a turning point in the Rogers and Astaire film cycle, and what evidence supports this argument?  

Swing Time, released in 1936, represented a turning point in the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film cycle for several reasons. First, Swing Time featured the most innovative and memorable dance numbers of the Astaire-Rogers films, second, Astaire and Rogers' acting and on-screen chemistry was at its peak in Swing Time, creating a more compelling love story, and third, the film contains sophisticated and witty dialogue and humor, showcasing the duo's talents in ways beyond just dance.

Swing Time is famous for featuring some of Astaire and Rogers' most acclaimed and technically brilliant dance numbers, demonstrating their growth as dancers and performers. The "Pick Yourself Up" number is a tour de force of tap dancing mastery, with Astaire dancing at superhuman speed. The "Waltz in Swing Time" is a beautiful combination of ballroom and ballet, showing their range and grace. But the highlight is the "Never Gonna Dance" finale, one of the most moving and bittersweet dance scenes in film history. The number culminates in a dramatic lift where Astaire holds Rogers aloft, a simple yet striking move that would become iconic. These dances represent the pinnacle of achievement in Astaire and Rogers' partnership.

In addition to the dance sequences, Swing Time features Astaire and Rogers' strongest on-screen chemistry and acting, enabling a more compelling love story. In their previous films, the plot was often flimsy and forgettable, merely functioning to set up the song-and-dance numbers. But in Swing Time, Astaire and Rogers take on roles with depth and nuance for the first time. Astaire plays a dancer who must prove his worth to win Rogers' hand, allowing him to show vulnerability and emotional range. And Rogers demonstrates her comedic talents, matching Astaire wit for wit. Together, their rapport and magnetism create real passion, heartbreak, and humor, crafting a romance that resonates more strongly. The improved acting and complex characters thus make Swing Time a turning point.

Finally, Swing Time contains dialogue and humor far wittier and more sophisticated than the duo's previous outings. In between dance scenes are clever repartee and jokes that show Astaire and Rogers to be gifted verbal comedians in addition to physical ones. Lines like "Men are not supposed to know how women get dressed" and "I'm still up on love, so please pass the potatoes" reveal the ability for sharp, ironic, and self-aware comedy previously unseen. The screenplay as a whole moved beyond the simpler escapist fare of earlier films, demonstrating that the Astaire-Rogers musical could also work as a platform for smart, verbal humor and social commentary.

In conclusion, Swing Time represented the pinnacle of the Astaire-Rogers partnership for its landmark dance numbers, emotionally compelling love story, and witty dialogue. More than just escapist entertainment, Swing Time proved that the musical film starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers could also be a showcase for innovative, moving, and funny popular art. It marked Astaire and Rogers coming into their own as multifaceted on-screen partners and cemented them in film history as one of the greatest romantic teams of Hollywood's golden age.
