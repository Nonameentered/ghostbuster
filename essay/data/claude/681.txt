Dysphasia is a language disorder that results from damage to the parts of the brain that are responsible for language. It causes difficulties with verbal communication, including problems finding the correct words to express thoughts and ideas, understanding speech, reading, and writing. The specific language problems experienced by someone with dysphasia depend on which parts of the brain have been damaged and the severity of the damage.  

There are several possible causes of the brain damage that can lead to dysphasia. The most common causes are stroke, traumatic brain injury, and brain tumor. A stroke happens when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, depriving brain cells of oxygen and nutrients. This can damage and destroy brain cells that control language. Traumatic brain injuries, such as concussions from accidents or physical trauma to the head, can also damage the language centers of the brain. Brain tumors, especially those located in the temporal or parietal lobes of the brain, may grow and put pressure on speech and language areas, causing dysphasia. Brain infections, degenerative neurological diseases, and aging-related changes can also sometimes contribute to dysphasia. 

To diagnose dysphasia, speech language pathologists will evaluate a personâ€™s speech, comprehension, reading, and writing. They will check how well the person understands spoken and written language, follows directions, and produces fluent speech. CT scans, MRIs, and EEGs are sometimes used to identify the underlying brain damage and determine which areas are affected. The specific diagnosis depends on which language functions are impaired and the severity of the impairments.

There are several treatments that can help improve communication ability and quality of life for people with dysphasia. Speech therapy is usually the primary treatment. Exercises that stimulate speech and language centers of the brain can help retrain it. Therapy may involve practicing targeted exercises that focus on pronunciation, finding words, understanding questions, using word recognition strategies, and learning communication techniques.
