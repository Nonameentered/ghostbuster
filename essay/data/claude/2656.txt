The Ancient Egyptians held complex and sometimes contradictory views on the ethics of magic. On the one hand, magic was an integral part of Egyptian religion and culture. The concepts of Ma'at, meaning order and harmony, and Heka, meaning magic or magical power, were fundamental to how Egyptians understood the universe and their place in it. Magic was a means of maintaining Ma'at and ensuring the functioning of the world. State magic, especially, was closely tied to official religious practices and the pharaoh's role as intermediary between the gods and the people. 

However, some types of magic were seen as disruptive or dangerous. Funerary magic, for instance, was critical for safely transporting the soul to the afterlife, but could be viewed as interfering with the natural process of death. Popular magic, practiced privately at a household level, was even more suspect as potentially contravening Ma'at by putting inappropriate magical power into common people's hands. Spells and rituals that manipulated others against their will or caused them direct harm were seen as unethical by most Egyptians.

The concepts of Ma'at and Heka suggested that magic should be practiced responsibly and for the good of all. However, in certain periods, some spells from sources like the Greek Magical Papyri showed a willingness to use magic for harm or personal gain. One such spell calls on spirits to "burn up the heart of the hated one...and inflame his liver with fire." Although these spells reflected influences from outside of Egypt, they still demonstrate how magic could be used unethically.

Overall, Egyptian values on magic were complex. At their core, magic and religion were deeply intertwined through the maintenance of Ma'at. However, magic was power, and power could be abused. State and funerary magic were tightly controlled, while popular magic was viewed with more suspicion. The line between ethical and unethical magic depended on the intentions and outcomes of the spells. Magic that disrupted order, caused unjustified harm, or was used for selfish gain would have been seen as transgressing Ma'at.

In conclusion, Egyptian magical ethics relied on concepts like Ma'at, Heka, and the role of the pharaoh. Following these principles, much of Egyptian magic was practiced responsibly and formed a key part of religious devotion. However, the potency of magic also meant that it could be a threat, whether through well-intentioned accidents or intentional exploitation. At its heart, the ethics of Egyptian magic rested on whether it maintained or disrupted the harmony of the universe.
