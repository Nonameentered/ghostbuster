A fiscal policy rule refers to a constraint placed on a government's budget deficit, surplus, debt levels, or spending. The goal of fiscal policy rules, also known as fiscal rules, is to encourage fiscal discipline and address the shortcomings of discretionary fiscal policymaking. 

Governments have an incentive to run large deficits by spending more and taxing less to please voters and get re-elected. However, chronically large deficits and accumulating government debt can be problematic and negatively impact the economy. Fiscal policy rules aim to counteract these political incentives by imposing constraints on governments to encourage sustainable levels of deficits and debt over the economic cycle. For example, a government may implement a rule to limit the budget deficit to no more than 3% of GDP each year. Or it may cap the national debt at 60% of GDP.

There are several benefits of fiscal policy rules. They can help ensure intergenerational equity by limiting the debt burden passed onto future generations. They also help stabilize the economy by avoiding boom-bust cycles caused by drastic changes in government spending. Fiscal rules may lower borrowing costs for a country by boosting investor confidence in the sustainability of government finances. They also promote transparency and accountability in the budget process.

However, there are some significant shortcomings of fiscal policy rules. They reduce flexibility to respond to economic crises and downturns. Strict rules may force procyclical fiscal policy that exacerbates recessions. Fiscal rules are also difficult to design and enforce. Governments may ignore or suspend the rules, especially during times of crisis. The rules themselves can be gamed using accounting tricks to appear as if the government is complying when deficits are actually higher.

Some examples of countries that have struggled with fiscal rules and large deficits include Italy, Greece, and Portugal. These southern European countries had deficit limits imposed under the Maastricht Treaty to join the Eurozone but did not adhere to them. They ran large deficits, accumulated high debt levels, and ultimately faced sovereign debt crises that required bailouts from other Eurozone countries and the IMF. Japan is another example of a country with high debt but no fiscal rules. Japan's government debt has surged to over 230% of GDP with no meaningful reduction in sight. 

In conclusion, fiscal policy rules aim to address political incentives for excessive deficits but also have significant limitations and challenges in implementation. For rules to be effective, they must be carefully designed, closely monitored, and enforced with meaningful sanctions when broken. Adopting fiscal rules is not a silver bullet, but they can play an important role as part of a larger strategy to encourage fiscal sustainability.
