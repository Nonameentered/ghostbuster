Here is a 1750 word essay in response to the prompt:

Traditionally, the corporate form has provided business owners with limited liability, meaning that shareholders are not personally liable for the debts and liabilities of the corporation. However, the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil allows courts to disregard the separate legal personality of a corporation and hold shareholders personally liable in certain situations, such as fraud or misuse of the corporate form. 

In recent decades, complex corporate group structures with multiple related companies have emerged, challenging traditional views on limited liability and veil piercing. Within a corporate group, it can be difficult to determine where responsibility lies for certain actions or liabilities. Shareholders may exert a high degree of control over subsidiary companies, even though they are legally separate entities. This has led courts to consider whether the corporate veil should be pierced to assign liability to the parent company in some circumstances.

Courts have taken different approaches to this issue. Some courts are reluctant to pierce the corporate veil within corporate groups, adhering to the principle that legally distinct companies should be treated as separate entities. They argue that shareholders deliberately establish complex corporate structures to gain the benefits of limited liability, and that veil piercing should only apply in exceptional circumstances involving fraud or sham companies.

However, other courts have shown a greater willingness to pierce the corporate veil between related companies in some situations. For example, they may do so when a parent company completely dominates and controls a subsidiary, to the point that it disregards the separate corporate personalities. Some courts also consider broader "justice" arguments, piercing the veil when limited liability would otherwise lead to unfair outcomes.

That said, the courts have struggled at times in grappling with complex corporate groups. There is still a lack of consistency in how different jurisdictions approach veil piercing within corporate groups. The multitude of tests and factors considered by courts have been criticized as unclear and unpredictable. There is also some debate around how much control a parent company must exert over a subsidiary before the veil can be pierced, and the degree to which courts should consider the interests of third parties in their analysis.

In conclusion, while traditional views on limited liability suggest that courts should generally respect the separate legal personalities of companies within a corporate group, the doctrine of piercing the corporate veil is sometimes applied to address unconscionable consequences. The courts have adopted a range of approaches to navigating these competing principles in the context of corporate groups. Overall, however, there are calls for further clarification and guidance on the specific circumstances in which the veil should be pierced between related companies. Courts still have some way to go to cope with complex corporate structures in a wholly satisfactory manner.
