Dark matter is a mysterious form of matter that appears to make up about 27% of the universe. Unlike normal matter, dark matter does not emit or reflect light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. Scientists know dark matter exists because of its gravitational effect on visible matter in the universe. Without including dark matter, theories of galaxy formation and the structure of the universe do not match our observations.   

Dark matter was first proposed in the 1930s by astronomer Fritz Zwicky. He observed the motion of galaxies in the Coma Cluster and realized there was not enough visible mass to hold the cluster together by gravity. He proposed there must be invisible "dark matter" providing additional mass. This proposal was controversial but gained more acceptance in the 1970s when astronomers found that galaxies hold together much more tightly than can be explained by the mass of their stars and gas alone. Additional evidence comes from the cosmic microwave background, gravitational lensing, and the structure of the early universe.

The leading candidates for the composition of dark matter are massive compact halo objects, or MACHOs, and weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. MACHOs include objects like black holes, neutron stars, brown dwarfs, and undetected planetsâ€”normal baryonic matter that does not emit light. However, there are likely not enough MACHOs to account for all of dark matter. WIMPs are proposed particles like neutrinos that only weakly interact with normal matter. They could have been created during the Big Bang and remain as a relic, filling the universe. Detecting WIMPs directly is challenging and they remain hypothetical.   

Astronomers detect dark matter through its gravitational effect on visible matter and light. By mapping the motion of galaxies and stars, they can infer the presence and distribution of dark matter. Dark matter's gravity also bends and distorts light from distant galaxies and objects, a phenomenon known as gravitational lensing. By studying how light is distorted as it travels through space, astronomers can map the location and amount of dark matter. Particle physicists hope to detect WIMPs directly using massive experiments housed deep underground to shield from cosmic rays. These detectors look for rare collisions between WIMPs and atoms. However, WIMPs interact so weakly that detecting them remains difficult.

In conclusion, while scientists have a good understanding of how much dark matter exists and where it is distributed, its exact composition remains a mystery. Astronomers and particle physicists continue to develop new techniques to better detect and characterize dark matter. Solving the dark matter puzzle remains one of the greatest challenges in physics and astronomy. With more sensitive instruments and experiments, scientists hope to finally illuminate this elusive component of the universe.
