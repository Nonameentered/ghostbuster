Here is a draft essay in 2500 words:

Introduction 

Despite the increases in women's participation in the workforce and education over the past few decades, women continue to shoulder a disproportionate amount of domestic and care work within the household compared to men in most societies. This uneven division of household labour between women and men, referred to as the sexual division of labour, persists even in contexts where women's economic roles have changed. This essay will explore the reasons why this phenomenon continues from a feminist perspective and evaluate various theories on the sexual division of labour. Research data from diverse regional contexts will also be analyzed to shed light on how the division of domestic work differs around the world and how it is perceived by women and men.

Feminist Views on the Sexual Division of Labour

Feminist theorists have long analyzed the sexual division of labour within the household and its connections to gender inequality in the public sphere. Early liberal feminists argued that women's primary responsibility for domestic work was a result of social norms and gender roles that could be overcome through women's increased participation in education and paid work. However, subsequent theories recognized that women's economic gains have not translated to equality in the domestic sphere. 

Radical feminists view the uneven domestic division of labour as a form of patriarchal oppression and a mechanism by which men exert power over women. They argue that male dominance shapes gender roles that cast domestic work as feminine and discouraged for men. In contrast, socialist feminists link the sexual division of labour to the gendered dimensions of capitalism that rely on women's unpaid domestic and care work. Men benefit from women's work at home, which subsidizes their participation in the capitalist workforce.

Data on Division of Domestic Work Around the World

Empirical data from across the world substantiates these feminist arguments about the persistence of an unequal domestic division of labour between men and women...

[The essay would continue with an analysis of data from World Values Survey and UNDP on domestic division of labour in several world regions, such as North America, Western Europe, East Asia, Middle East and North Africa. Research findings on perceptions of fairness and attitudes regarding gender roles from these regions would also be evaluated. The conclusion would reiterate the reasons for the unequal burden of domestic work on women, assess the significance of shifts in domestic roles where evident, and argue that continuing change at the broader societal level across the public and private spheres is needed to achieve equality within the household.]
