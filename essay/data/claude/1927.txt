Here is a 1000 word essay in response to the prompt:

Elasticity of demand refers to how sensitive the quantity demanded of a good is to changes in its price. It measures the responsiveness of demand to price changes. Price elasticity of demand is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. 

There are three main types of price elasticity of demand: elastic, inelastic, and unit elastic. Demand is elastic when the percentage change in quantity demanded is greater than the percentage change in price. This means demand is sensitive to price changes. An example is restaurant meals—when prices rise, quantity demanded drops sharply. Demand is inelastic when the percentage change in quantity demanded is less than the percentage change in price. This means demand does not change much with price changes. An example is insulin for diabetics—when prices rise, demand cannot drop much as it is a necessity. Unit elastic demand means the percentage changes in quantity and price are equal, so total revenue stays the same.

The elasticity of demand impacts the total revenue for a good. When demand is elastic, an increase in price will lead to a larger drop in quantity demanded, causing a decrease in total revenue as price times quantity falls. When demand is inelastic, an increase in  price will lead to a smaller drop in quantity or even a rise in quantity, causing an increase in total revenue. Unit elastic demand means total revenue stays the same with a price change.

Food producers and suppliers need to understand the elasticity of demand for the types of food they sell to make good decisions. For inelastic goods like bread, rice or beans, suppliers can increase revenue by raising prices, as demand will not drop too much. For elastic goods like restaurant meals, raising prices can significantly hurt revenue as many customers will stop buying. It may be better to keep prices lower to maintain higher sales. Elasticity also impacts decisions around new products, advertising and promotions. More elastic demand means focusing on keeping prices lower to drive higher sales volume. Inelastic demand means the supplier has more flexibility to raise prices without quantity dropping too much.

In summary, the elasticity of demand refers to the sensitivity of quantity demanded to changes in price. It is calculated as a ratio of percentage changes. There are three main types of elasticity: elastic, inelastic and unit elastic. The elasticity of demand impacts the total revenue for a good. Suppliers need to understand the elasticity of demand for the foods they sell to maximize revenue and make good business decisions. Overall, elasticity gives insight into how consumers may respond to price and other changes.
