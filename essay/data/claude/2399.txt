Here is a 1250-word essay in response to the prompt:

John Locke distinguished between the primary and secondary qualities of an object. According to Locke, the primary qualities of an object are those qualities that are inseparable from the object, exist independently of the perceiver's mind, and cause the secondary qualities. These include qualities such as solidity, extension, figure, motion or rest, and number. The secondary qualities are produced in the perceiver's mind as a result of the primary qualities. These include colors, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures. Locke argued that the secondary qualities are mind-dependent and cannot exist without a perceiver. 

Locke's argument for this distinction rests on several reasons. First, he argues that the primary qualities are in the object itself, whether or not there is a perceiver. For example, a spherical object remains spherical regardless of whether anyone perceives it. However, the secondary qualities require a perceiver - there are no colors, sounds or smells without a functioning mind. Second, the primary qualities cause the secondary qualities. For example, the molecular arrangement of an object causes it to reflect certain wavelengths of light, which we then perceive as color. If there is no light, there is no color perception. Third, the secondary qualities vary based on the perceiver and conditions, whereas primary qualities remain constant. For example, the color of an object depends on the lighting and the functioning of the viewer's visual system. An object may appear yellow in daylight but green in dim light. However, its spherical shape remains the same. 

Locke's distinction implies that we can never perceive the object as it really is in itself. We only experience its secondary qualities, which exist in our own minds. The material world as it exists independently of perception thus remains unknowable to us. We can only infer the existence of primary qualities from the secondary qualities they produce in us. This creates a barrier between the perceiver's mind and the external world.

George Berkeley critiqued Locke's theory and rejected the distinction between primary and secondary qualities. Berkeley put forth an idealist argument that only minds and ideas exist. He argued that Locke's theory implies the existence of a "material substratum" - an unperceivable reality underlying the perceptible qualities. However, for Berkeley, to be is to be perceived. Anything apart from a mind or a perceiver cannot be said to exist. Since the so-called primary qualities cannot exist unperceived, they must also be ideas in the perceiver's mind, just like the secondary qualities.

Berkeley argued that it is nonsensical to speak of objects outside of perception. We cannot deduce what an object might be like divorced from all perception. We only know objects through ideas, and every idea requires a mind. The shapes, motions, numbers and other qualities Locke considers as primary exist meaningfully only as ideas in the mind. For Berkeley, there is no knowable world outside of mind and perception. Matter is a useless hypothesis. The only reality is comprised of minds, ideas, and the spiritual substance in which ideas inhere.

In conclusion, Locke made a distinction between primary and secondary qualities to argue that we have limited access to the material world as it really is. However, Berkeley rejected this distinction and the very notion of matter itself. For Berkeley, reality consists of nothing but minds, spirits and their ideas. The project of trying to understand what material objects may be like outside of perception is futile. The mind-dependent nature of experience implies that there can be no material world independent of perception.
