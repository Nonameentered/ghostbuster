The Roman army had an enormous impact on the social and political structures of conquered regions throughout the Roman Empire. However, this impact varied significantly based on the region and local conditions. In some areas, the Romans maintained significant continuity with existing social and political institutions, while in other areas the Romans imposed substantial changes and imposed their template of Romanization more directly. 

In regions like Italy, Spain, and Gaul, the Romans typically maintained substantial continuity with existing political structures and social institutions. The Romans established treaties with local aristocrats and allowed them to maintain their positions of power and influence, as long as they pledged allegiance to Rome. Local customs and laws were often left in place. The Romans imposed taxation, military conscription, and other obligations, but otherwise allowed for self-governance under the umbrella of the Roman Republic and later Empire.

In contrast, in other regions like Greece, North Africa, and Judea, the Romans took more direct control and imposed greater changes. Existing political institutions were restructured, local aristocracies were removed from power, and Roman law and administrative practices were directly imposed. Local languages, customs, and religions were suppressed in favor of the spread of Latin and Roman religious and social practices. 

The degree of Romanization ultimately depended on several factors. Practical considerations like the threat of resistance or unrest led the Romans to tread more lightly in some areas. Cultural factors like the degree of "civilization" of the local population also played a role - the Romans saw more "advanced" societies like the Greeks as more culturally akin to themselves, whereas "barbarian" populations required more drastic Romanization. The resources and strategic importance of a region also mattered, as economically or militarily critical areas received more direct Roman control and changes.

Over time, the trends toward more gradual Romanization and continuity gave way to the gradual spread of Roman political and social institutions across the Empire. By the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, Roman law, administration, religion, language, and other elements of Roman culture dominated throughout the Empire. Local political and social structures had been largely replaced, and a homogeneous Roman identity emerged.

In conclusion, the Roman army was instrumental in extending Roman control over conquered territories, but its impact on local social and political structures varied significantly based on region and time period. In some areas, the Romans maintained more continuity with existing institutions, while in other regions the army was a mechanism for imposing direct and drastic changes to bring about Romanization. Over centuries of control, however, Roman institutions gradually spread throughout the Empire, supplanting local structures with a Roman template.
