Discuss the main elements of modernism found in Henrik Ibsen's play 'Ghosts'. How do these elements challenge Victorian values and beliefs? Analyze the characters of Mrs Alving and Pastor Manders to support your argument.

Henrik Ibsen's play 'Ghosts' incorporates several elements of modernism that challenge the Victorian values and beliefs prevailing in the 19th century. Some of the key modernist elements in the play include a rejection of tradition, a challenge to moral and social norms, and a move towards individualism and freethinking.

One of the hallmarks of modernism is a rejection of tradition and established conventions. Ibsen rebelled against the traditional comedic and romantic theatrical forms in his time, pioneering a new 'realistic' drama that addressed controversial social issues. In 'Ghosts', Ibsen rejected the Victorian belief that the arts should be 'pure' and avoided controversial topics. The play's frank discussion of taboo subjects such as incest, venereal disease and euthanasia challenged Victorian moral values.

Ibsen also challenged prevailing social norms and moral values in 'Ghosts'. Victorian society emphasised duty, honor, repression of desire, and strict moral rules. Ibsen rejected these social norms and moral absolutes in his play. For example, the character Mrs Alving challenges conventional Victorian morality and leaves her abusive husband, defying her duty as a wife. The character of Pastor Manders represents the outdated moral absolutes of Victorian society, while Mrs Alving embraces moral ambiguity and individual freedom.

Modernism also emphasised individualism, freethinking and a move away from tradition. In 'Ghosts', Ibsen portrays characters who follow their individual conscience rather than blindly accept social rules. Mrs Alving is an independent freethinker who comes to realise her true self by rejecting social conventions. In contrast, Pastor Manders represents an older traditional way of thinking, blindly accepting moral absolutes without question. However, at the end, even Manders begins to open his mind, indicating Ibsen's belief in individual enlightenment and progress.

In conclusion, Ibsen's play 'Ghosts' incorporated modernist elements such as a rejection of tradition, a challenge to moral norms, and promotion of freethinking individualism. Through characters like the freethinking Mrs Alving and the traditional Pastor Manders, Ibsen challenged Victorian values and beliefs, instead promoting individual enlightenment and moral ambiguity. The play marked a radical departure from tradition and illustrated the dawn of modernism in theatre.
