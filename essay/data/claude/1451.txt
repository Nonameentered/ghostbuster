Here is a draft 2500 word essay in response to the prompt:

Oscar Wilde is renowned for his lighthearted and witty style, often treating serious themes in a satirical and ironic manner. This trivializing of the profound manifests throughout Wilde's works, from his surreal and whimsical fairy tales to his comedic moral inversions in plays such as The Importance of Being Earnest. 

One of Wilde's earliest works showcasing his trivialization of serious themes is his collection of fairy tales titled A House of Pomegranates. The fairy tales explore deep and meaningful topics such as love, death, and morality. However, Wilde frames these serious themes through a lens of whimsical surrealism, fantastical symbolism, and absurdist humor. For example, in the tale “The Young King,” Wilde explores hypocrisy around Christianity and poverty. Yet he does so through the bizarre story of a pampered prince who despises the lavish attire prepared for his coronation. Wilde coats the sobering message about inequality and hypocrisy in the cloak of a surreal fairy tale.

Wilde's most famous plays, including The Importance of Being Earnest, also demonstrate Wilde's signature ability to trivialize gravitas. The Importance of Being Earnest satirizes the upper crust of Victorian society with frivolous plot lines centered around mundane trivialities, like where characters were baptized. Yet Wilde masterfully inverts moral lessons and ethics beneath the superficial triviality. In Act I, when Algernon discovers that his friend Ernest was in fact baptized as “Jack,” Algernon remarks that it is “a very ungentlemanly thing to do” to change one's name, showing an absurd inversion of morality that excuses larger sins but condemns trivial offenses. The play is quintessential Wilde in its ability to convey moral messages through lighthearted triviality and absurdity.

In his prose as well, Wilde frequently cloaks earnestness in wit. For example, in “The Decay of Lying,” Wilde argues that artifice is superior to nature. Yet he conveys this message through the playful triviality of a fictional philosophical dialogue at an English country house party. The form belies the serious arguments Wilde puts forward about the importance of artifice and imagination. Similarly, in De Profundis, Wilde's long letter written from prison, Wilde is able to blend deepest sorrow with witty social observations, demonstrating that his signature style remained even during the most profound moments of his life.

In sum, Wilde consistently treats the most serious and meaningful themes in a lighthearted, ironic and absurd manner across his works. From his fairy tales to his plays and prose, Wilde philosophically trivializes profundity in a way that allows his messages to come across as simultaneously earnest and playful. This radical blending of seriousness and triviality gives Wilde's works philosophical depth as well as timeless wit and levity. Wilde proves that surface triviality does not necessarily preclude deeper meaning. And vice versa, the most profound of themes need not be treated with dour gravitas—they can manifest with absurdity and laughter as well. This is the heart of Wilde's philosophy of trivializing the serious.
