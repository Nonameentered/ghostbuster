The main objectives of a report investigating the effects of cyclic loading on plain Aluminium Alloy beams would be: 1) To determine the impact of cyclic plastic deformation on residual stresses and strain profiles in the beams; 2) To evaluate how this affects the fatigue life and failure of the beams; 3) To compare predicted values of fatigue life from theory vs actual experimental results.  

Fatigue is the weakening and eventual breaking of materials subjected to repeated loading and unloading. As a beam is cyclically loaded past its yield point into the plastic zone, residual stresses and strains develop within the material that do not recover when the load is removed. With each loading cycle these residual stresses accumulate, initiating cracks and other damage that eventually causes material failure at stress levels below the yield strength. 

The report would test beams of a single material, such as a common Aluminum Alloy like 6061-T6. The beams would be subjected to cyclic four-point bending to introduce post-yield loading and plastic deformation. Strain gauges and other instruments would measure residual stress and strain at multiple points as loading progresses. Theoretical calculations would predict the fatigue life of the beams based on the material properties. The actual number of cycles to failure for each beam would be recorded through experimentation.

The findings would show residual stresses and strain increasing substantially in the beams as cyclic post-yield loading accumulates. The report may find residual stresses and strain were highest at the midpoint of the beams. The measured and predicted fatigue lives of the beams may differ somewhat, with experimental results always lower due to imperfections in materials and testing. Important factors determining a component's fatigue life would be: the geometry of the part, the magnitude of cyclic loading, the material's endurance limit, flaws in the material, and mean stress.

In summary, the objectives would be to study how cyclic plastic deformation affects Aluminum Alloy beams, develop methods to predict their fatigue life, and see how well these methods match reality. The findings would provide insight into how post-yield cyclic loading progressively damages materials and shortens the service lives of structural components. By better understanding and predicting fatigue, the risk of catastrophic structural failure can be reduced through improved designs, material selection, reduced loading, and non-destructive testing methods.
