Carthage's aims during the First and Second Punic Wars were complex and evolved based on the political situation in the western Mediterranean, available resources, and leadership. In the First Punic War, Carthage initially aimed to gain control of Sicily and to check the expansion of Rome. However, as the war progressed and Carthage experienced military setbacks, its aims shifted to first avoiding losing territory and then gaining peace. In the interim between the wars, Carthage aimed to recover its strength and expand power in Spain under Hamilcar Barca. In the Second Punic War, under Hannibal's leadership, Carthage aimed to weaken Rome by inflicting massive casualties in Italy and gaining allies. However, after Rome's recovery and counterattack, Carthage again aimed simply to avoid losing territory and gain peace.

At the start of the First Punic War in 264 BCE, Carthage aimed to gain control of Sicily. Sicily was close to Carthage's domains and home to many Carthaginian colonies. However, the island was also strategically and economically important to Rome. When Rome backed mercenaries in Messina against Carthage, Carthage dispatched forces to check Rome's power. Carthage aimed to protect its interests, enforce its dominion over Sicily, and curb Roman expansion. However, Rome gained momentum and occupied much of Sicily. As Carthage experienced losses and a decline in resources, its aims shifted to avoiding losing its Sicilian territory and colonies altogether and gaining peace. After 23 years of war, Carthage signed a treaty giving up claims to Sicily.

In the interwar period, Carthage's aims were to recover strength and expand influence in Spain under Hamilcar Barca. He conquered territory in southern Spain, aimed to gain silver mines, and trained Hannibal's army. Carthage aimed to rebuild power to again challenge Rome.

At the start of the Second Punic War in 218 BCE under Hannibal, Carthage aimed to inflict major defeats against Rome in Italy and weaken Rome's power. Hannibal invaded Italy over the Alps, won major victories at Trebbia, Trasimene, and Cannae, and gained many Roman allies. However, Rome avoided collapse and launched a counterattack in Spain and Sicily. As Rome regained momentum, Carthage's aims again shifted to avoiding losing territory and gaining peace. After 17 years, Carthage signed a treaty giving up claims to Spain and paying a huge indemnity.

In conclusion, Carthage's aims were influenced by its political and military situation, resources, and leadership. Early in both wars, Carthage aimed to expand power but later aimed primarily to cut losses and gain peace due to setbacks and declines in resources. Under different leaders, Carthage had different aims, with expansionist aims under Hamilcar and Hannibal but more defensive aims otherwise. The changing aims of Carthage during the Punic Wars demonstrated how pragmatic and adaptable Carthage was in its foreign policy and military objectives.
