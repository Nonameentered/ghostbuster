Here is a draft 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

The 1969 film Easy Rider, directed by Dennis Hopper, makes use of various film techniques to convey a sense of aimlessness and boredom during  the journey of two bikers, Wyatt and Billy, traveling across the American Southwest. This feeling of wandering without purpose helps build tension for the audience and ultimately makes the abrupt climax of the film all the more impactful.

One of the first techniques the film employs to convey aimlessness is the lack of a strictly linear plot or destination for the characters. While Wyatt and Billy have a vague goal to travel to Mardi Gras in New Orleans, there are few specifics about the exact route they will take or timeline for their journey. Instead, they meander through the Southwest, stopping wherever and whenever they please. There are frequent scenes of them randomly encountering new characters or stumbling upon new locations, giving the audience a feeling that even the bikers themselves are not sure where they are heading or why. This plotlessness and wandering creates a tone of restlessness and boredom that pervades the first two-thirds of the film.        

The cinematography also contributes to the sense of aimless drifting in Easy Rider. There are many long shots of Wyatt and Billy riding down long, empty highways or through vast desert landscapes. These shots are fairly static and unchanging, showing the monotonous scenery passing by at a steady and unhurried pace. The drawn-out lengths of the shots, combined with the minimal dialogue in these scenes, evoke the slowness of the journey and reinforce the idea that the bikers have no urgency or real purpose.  Many of the pans and transitions between shots also have a lethargic, meandering quality, sweeping across landscapes without any clear endpoint, which helps to elicit a feeling of aimless wandering in the audience.  

The directionlessness of the story and long, drifting shots are also complemented by the characters themselves appearing rather aimless and purposeless. Wyatt and Billy move at an unhurried pace, embodied through their casual style of dress, languid body language, and laconic way of speaking. They pass the time by getting high, riding their motorcycles, and not doing much else. There are few conversations about where they are going or what they want to achieve. Instead, their focus seems to rest primarily on simple pleasures and living in the present. This attitude and lifestyle further underscores the theme of living without purpose or direction that permeates the film.

Overall, through plot, cinematography, and characterization, Easy Rider cultivates a strong sense of aimlessness, restlessness, and wandering without purpose during Wyatt and Billy's journey across the Southwest. By drawing out this boredom and lack of direction for the majority of the film, it makes the climax, in which [plot point and analysis], all the more jarring and impactful for the audience. The techniques build anticipation for when and how this aimless journey might find a destination, ultimately arriving at an ending that is unexpected yet brings a conclusion to the restless searching that defined the journey all along.
