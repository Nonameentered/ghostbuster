Here is a 754 word essay in response to the prompt:

Oestrogen activates gene transcription through binding to the intracellular oestrogen receptor (ER), which then associates with DNA and regulates the expression of target genes. The ER functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor. In the absence of oestrogen, the ER is bound to heat shock proteins that maintain it in an inactive state. Upon binding oestrogen, the ER undergoes a conformational change that causes it to dissociate from the heat shock proteins. The activated ER can then dimerize with another ER molecule. 

The ER dimer binds to specific DNA sequences known as oestrogen response elements (EREs) that are located in the promoter regions of oestrogen-responsive genes. However, the ER dimers have weak DNA binding activity on their own. They recruit various coactivator proteins to enable strong and specific binding to EREs. These coactivator proteins, which include SRC-1, SRC-2, SRC-3, CARM-1, and p300/CBP, help stabilize the binding of ER dimers to DNA through protein-protein interactions. They also have intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, which can modify histones and open up the chromatin structure to facilitate access of the transcriptional machinery.

In addition to binding directly to EREs, ER dimers can interact with other transcription factors like AP-1 and Sp1 that are bound to their own recognition sequences in DNA. Through these interactions, the ER can then influence gene expression indirectly. The coactivators are also recruited to these transcription factor binding sites. By interacting with multiple transcription factors, the ER is able to regulate a larger set of genes through these alternative pathways.

Once bound to DNA, the ER dimers and coactivators then recruit RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors to initiate mRNA synthesis. The coactivators also have connections to enzymatic activities involved in transcription elongation and mRNA processing. Therefore, they help propagate and amplify the oestrogen signal to activate gene expression. In conclusion, oestrogen causes a cascade of events from ER activation to changes in gene transcription. Multiple coactivator proteins with diverse functions are necessary for mediating the effects of ER at every step to ultimately achieve oestrogen-responsive gene expression.
