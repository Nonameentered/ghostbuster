Here is a draft essay in 1000 words:

Alcoholic liver disease refers to damage to the liver caused by excessive alcohol consumption. It occurs in three stages: fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis. In the fatty liver stage, excess fat accumulates in liver cells. This is reversible by abstaining from alcohol. If alcohol use continues, it can progress to alcoholic hepatitis, which is characterized by inflammation and damage to liver cells. This can lead to scarring and hardening of the liver tissue known as cirrhosis, the most severe stage.  

Several clinical signs and symptoms manifest as the disease progresses. In alcoholic hepatitis, patients experience fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, jaundice or yellowing of the skin, and enlarged liver. Ascites, or fluid buildup in the abdomen, and varices, which are swollen veins, may also occur.  Portal hypertension develops due to scarring in the liver, which obstructs blood flow through the portal vein. This results in ascites as fluid leaks into the abdomen. Patients may require diuretics and a low-sodium diet to reduce fluid retention. 

Psychological and social factors can contribute to alcohol addiction and make it challenging to quit drinking. Traumatic experiences such as physical or emotional abuse, loss of a loved one, exposure to alcoholism at a young age, and peer pressure can all play a role. Feelings of anxiety, depression, loneliness or boredom may drive some to drink excessively as a form of self-medication. Treatment requires a multi-pronged approach to address these underlying issues through counseling and social support systems.

The most effective steps towards overcoming alcohol addiction begin with the desire and motivation to quit. Patients should avoid triggers like people or places that encourage drinking, find new hobbies and social activities that do not involve alcohol, and make lifestyle changes to establish a new routine. Joining a support group, engaging in talk therapy, and finding ways to cope with stress and difficult emotions can help reframe thinking patterns and make sobriety a long-term success. Anti-craving medications may also be used under medical supervision. Overall, psychological and social support are fundamental to conquering alcohol addiction.

In summary, alcoholic liver disease progresses through several harmful stages if left untreated. Clinical signs of disease and resulting complications like portal hypertension and ascites can significantly impact health and quality of life. Though overcoming addiction is challenging, addressing the underlying psychological and social factors with professional support and motivation to change can help patients achieve freedom from alcohol dependence.
