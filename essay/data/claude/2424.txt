Here is a draft 2000 word essay in response to the prompt:

High yielding dairy cows have been bred and managed over the past few decades to dramatically increase milk production. These specialized dairy breeds, especially Holsteins, now produce an average of 22,000 pounds of milk per year in the US, compared to around 5,000 pounds in the 1940s. This massive increase in productivity has enabled the dairy industry to become highly efficient and cost-effective. However, these high yields also come with significant animal welfare issues and environmental costs that should give us pause in the relentless pursuit of ever higher production.  

On the benefits side, high yielding cows have enabled dairy farmers to produce a large supply of milk and dairy products at a low cost. The specialized dairy breeds and advanced farming techniques mean fewer cows are needed to produce the same volume of milk. This significantly reduces costs for farmers in feed, medication, housing, and labor. These efficiency gains have translated into lower prices for consumers and higher profits for farmers and dairy companies. The increased supply of dairy products has also improved food security and reduced malnutrition around the world.  

However, the single-minded focus on maximum yields has led to serious issues with animal welfare. High yielding dairy cows suffer from a number of health issues, including udder infections, lameness, and a shorter lifespan. They have been bred to prioritize milk production over everything else, often at the expense of the cow's health and longevity. Many dairy cows today live just 3 to 4 years, compared to 15-20 years for moderate producing breeds. They also suffer from extreme physical stress due to the metabolic demands of producing so much milk, especially in early lactation. The welfare of these animals should be of greater concern.

High yielding dairy cows also have a large environmental footprint due to their intensive resource requirements. They consume huge amounts of food, water, and grains to sustain their yields, and they produce methane emissions and manure waste in large volumes. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and manure waste can pollute the air and water. As the world's population grows, the environmental impact of industrial milk production is becoming increasingly unsustainable. 

In conclusion, while high yielding dairy cows have enabled an efficient and productive dairy industry, they also raise important issues around animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and ethics. A balanced policy approach is needed that continues to support dairy farmers and address food insecurity, but also promotes more moderate, sustainable milk yields and compassionate treatment of animals. Simply pushing for ever higher production is a flawed strategy that benefits neither animals nor the planet in the long run. The costs of extreme yields in terms of animal suffering and environmental damage are too great to ignore. More sustainable and humane alternatives must be incorporated into the system. Overall, high yielding dairy cows highlight the tensions between productivity, efficiency, animal welfare, and sustainabilityâ€”tensions that urgently deserve our attention and action.
