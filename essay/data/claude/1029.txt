What factors affect consumer spending on organic food and what is the profile of Waitrose's organic consumers?

Several factors influence consumer spending on organic food. The most important factors are health consciousness, environmental awareness, and values such as animal welfare. Consumers who are health conscious and concerned about the effects of chemicals, pesticides and additives in conventional food are more likely to spend money on organic food. Organic food is perceived as more natural, nutritious and better for health and well-being. Environmental awareness also drives spending on organic food. Consumers who value sustainability, reducing pollution and protecting wildlife habitats tend to support organic food because it is perceived as more environmentally friendly. Some consumers spend money on organic food due to concerns about animal welfare and believing that organic food production results in more ethical treatment of animals.  

Income and socioeconomic status are also significant factors. Organic food is often more expensive, so higher income consumers are more able to afford it and willing to pay the premium. Waitrose in particular targets affluent and middle-class consumers, who make up the bulk of organic food buyers. A consumer's lifestyle, values and habits also influence spending. Those with an eco-friendly lifestyle, liberal values and an interest in new food trends tend to buy more organic products. Education level plays a role as well, with highly educated consumers more aware of the perceived benefits of organic food.

Waitrose's organic consumers reflect these factors. They tend to be affluent, aged 35-55, environmentally and health conscious, and educated. A 2011 study found over half of Waitrose's consumers are in managerial and professional occupations. Waitrose's organic range appeals to consumers looking for high quality, ethical products.

In conclusion, while health and environmental motivations are the primary drivers, a consumer's income, lifestyle, values, education, and habits are also significant influences on spending for organic food. Waitrose's core organic customers exhibit these attributes, underpinning Waitrose's success and continued growth in the organic market. Overall, understanding consumers and tailoring products to their priorities is key for any company, and the demand for organic produce looks set to continue rising over the coming years.
