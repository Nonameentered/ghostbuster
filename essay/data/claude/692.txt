Both the Orchestrating Knowledge  image and the Process, Power and Change image recognize the value of an emergent strategy in the British Airways (BA) case examined by Sullivan-Taylor. 

The Orchestrating Knowledge image portrays strategy as developing through the sharing and combining of local knowledge and insights across an organization. This was evident in the BA case as ideas for improvement emerged from employees at multiple levels who understood the specifics of their work area or customer interactions. These local insights were then aggregated and synthesized into larger changes, like the ‘Customer First’ program. 

Similarly, the Process, Power and Change image sees strategy as shaped by the interplay of internal and external processes, relationships and power dynamics. At BA, the processes of gathering customer feedback, reviewing complaints, and analyzing the sources of lost revenue helped surface issues to address. The relative power and influence of leaders like Colin Marshall also shaped which ideas were incorporated into the new strategy. However, external pressures from dissatisfied customers with options to choose competitors also drove change.

In both images, strategy is an adaptive and iterative phenomenon. There is no predetermined strategic plan handed down from on high. Rather, strategy evolves based on a range of inputs, insights and actions at multiple levels of the organization as well as changes in the external environment. A variety of internal and external constituents and processes shape strategy in a collaborative fashion. 
 
This is in contrast to more traditional ‘design’ conceptions of strategy in which senior leaders isolate themselves to craft a comprehensive strategy that is then implemented according to plan. The images of Orchestrating Knowledge and Process, Power and Change recognize that in many cases, including at BA, a purely ‘designed’ strategy process is unrealistic.  An emergent strategy that is responsive to a diversity of inputs may be most suitable for complex challenges.
