Does morality require religion in order to be justified? This question explores the relationship between morality and religious belief. On one view, moral relativism, morality is dependent on the beliefs and cultural practices of a society. Moral relativists argue that there are no absolute or universal moral truths that apply across all contexts. Rather, moral judgments and prescriptions are relative to the context of the culture and society in which they originate. In contrast, moral objectivists believe that certain fundamental moral tenets hold true regardless of culture or circumstance. 

Relativism aims to be tolerant and open-minded, recognizing the diversity of moral views that exist across the world. However, relativism risks slipping into subjectivism, the notion that moral judgments are solely based on personal feelings and desires. Subjectivism provides no standards beyond personal inclination by which to evaluate moral obligations and virtues. As such, it risks justifying acts that violate basic human decency and well-being. Relativism also risks sliding into nihilism, the belief that nothing has meaning or moral significance. If morality is purely relative and there are no objective moral truths, then there may be no moral truths at all.

Objectivism grounds morality in fundamental features of human existence and sentient being. For example, all humans and sentient creatures have basic interests in avoiding harm and death, having access to resources to sustain themselves, and being able to live freely and socially interact and engage with others of their kind. Any moral theory that did not recognize and respect these basic interests would be flawed and unjustified. So there exist certain objective "first principles" of morality that any viable moral theory must incorporate.

The relativist may turn to religion to provide a sense of moral authority and obligation that might otherwise be lacking. Religions often make moral proclamations and pronouncements, giving followers rules and codes of conduct. The relativist can then point to these religious moral precepts as a basis for morality within that religious tradition and community of believers. However, this justification of morality based on religious belief is still subject to the charge of subjectivism - it is grounded in the personal faith and subjective experiences of religious adherents rather than on any objective moral criteria.

In conclusion, while moral relativism aims to be open-minded and recognize diversity of belief, it risks slipping into subjectivism and nihilism by lacking any objective moral anchors. Moral objectivism grounded in human and sentient nature is better able to provide objective moral justification. And while religion may be used to justify and enforce moral precepts, it ultimately also rests on subjective faith rather than objective reason. So on balance, morality does not require religious belief to be justified. Objective reason alone is sufficient. A universal and objective secular morality is possible based on reasoned arguments from human and sentient interests.
