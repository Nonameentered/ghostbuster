Accidents and injuries are some of the leading causes of death and harm in the agricultural sector. According to the International Labour Organization, agriculture is one of the three most dangerous industries, and accounts for about half of the total work-related deaths that occur each year. There are several reasons why agriculture can be risky work, but many measures can be taken to decrease incidents and improve health and safety for farmers and farmworkers.  

One of the primary causes of accidents on farms is the use of heavy machinery and equipment. Tractors, harvesters, balers, and other mechanized implements can be dangerous if not operated properly. Workers can be killed or seriously injured in tractor rollovers, entanglements, collisions, and other accidents involving farm vehicles or equipment. Proper training on machinery operation and maintenance is essential to reducing these risks. Guidelines also recommend installing seatbelts, rollover protective structures, guards for power take-off shafts, and other safety mechanisms on all equipment.    

Handling and working with large animals also poses major hazards. Cattle in particular can be threatening, especially in confined areas. Farmers and ranch hands can be crushed, trampled, or gored by cattle during feeding, transport, milking, branding, and other close-proximity tasks. Establishing safe handling procedures, using restraining equipment, and working in groups are important ways to avoid harm from livestock. 

Chemical exposure is another significant source of damage in agriculture. Pesticides, fertilizers, disinfectants and other agents used on farms can cause both acute and long-term health issues if mishandled or misused. Guidelines on proper usage, storage, application and disposal of agricultural chemicals can help limit exposure risks for workers. Providing and requiring the use of personal protective equipment is also key. 

Legislation has been enacted to promote health and safety in agriculture. Standards set by organizations like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration aim to regulate farm working conditions, set guidelines on best practices, and make farms liable for following recommended procedures. However, there is still much work to be done to fully implement health and safety regulations on small private farms in some areas.  

At large commercial and institutional farms like CEDAR, a comprehensive and well-organized health and safety management system is essential to reducing accidents and harm. Things like accident prevention plans, risk assessments, safety audits, training programs, and emergency response procedures can help identify hazards and take steps to avoid incidents before they happen. Promoting a culture of health and safety through regular communication and reinforcement for workers is key to the success of any management program.  

In summary, there are several actions that can be taken to decrease injuries and improve wellbeing for those who work in agriculture. Understanding the main risks, following recommended safety practices, using protective equipment, and organizing management systems are some of the most effective ways to ensure health and safety on farms. By making injury and accident prevention a priority, lives can be saved and suffering averted for farmers and farmworkers around the world.
