Sensory transduction refers to the process by which physical stimuli are converted into neural signals that can be interpreted by the brain. There are diverse mechanisms involved in transducing the five major sensory modalities: touch, heat, light, sound, and smell. While there are some similarities across the senses, the specific transduction pathways for each sense are quite distinct.

The sense of touch relies on receptors in the skin called mechanoreceptors that detect physical pressure and movement. Four types of mechanoreceptors are involved in touch: Pacinian corpuscles detect deep pressure and vibration; Meissner's corpuscles detect light touch; Ruffini endings detect stretch; and free nerve endings detect pain and temperature. These mechanoreceptors contain nerve endings that are activated when mechanically stimulated, releasing neurotransmitters that send signals to the central nervous system. The sensory information is transmitted via the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway to the somatosensory cortex.

Thermoreception, or the sense of temperature, also relies on free nerve endings in the skin that contain temperature-sensitive ion channels. These ion channels open or close in response to heating or cooling, altering the membrane potential of the nerve ending and generating action potentials that signal the perception of temperature to the brain. The somatosensory pathway is likewise involved in the transmission of this sensory information.

Vision relies on photoreception in the retina to detect light. Photoreceptors called rods and cones contain light-sensitive pigments that undergo conformational changes upon absorbing photons, activating a biochemical cascade that ultimately generates nerve signals sent to the visual cortex via the optic nerve. The visual system has parallel processing pathways that separately analyze details like color, motion, depth, and object recognition.

The sense of hearing depends on mechanoreception in the inner ear. Sound waves cause vibrations in the tympanic membrane, which transfer the mechanical energy to the fluid-filled cochlea. The cochlea contains hair cells with stereocilia that move in response to the fluid waves, opening ion channels and producing nerve signals that are transmitted to the auditory cortex for the perception of sound. The frequency of sound is encoded in the specific region of the cochlea stimulated.  

Finally, the sense of smell relies on chemoreception in the olfactory epithelium. Olfactory receptor neurons contain odorant receptors that bind odor molecules in the air, activating a signaling cascade that produces nerve impulses transmitted to the olfactory bulb and cortex. There are about 400 different odorant receptors that allow us to detect a wide range of smells. The olfactory system is closely connected with the limbic system, allowing smells to evoke memories and emotions.

In summary, while sensory transduction relies in all cases on the conversion of a physical stimulus into electrochemical signals in specialized receptor cells, the precise mechanisms for how each type of information is detected and encoded in the nervous system differ for the various senses. The similarities lie in the fact that they all involve activation of receptors and signaling pathways that ultimately transmit neural impulses to the brain, where sensory perception arises. The differences determine the qualities and capacities of each sense.
