The Bohr model of the atom was proposed by Niels Bohr in 1913. It depicts the atom as a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons that orbit the nucleus in discrete, circular orbits. The model aimed to explain the atomic spectra of hydrogen, and was an early model of the internal structure of the atom. While it was groundbreaking for its time and contributed to major advances in physics, the Bohr model is limited and has been shown to be fundamentally flawed and incomplete by more sophisticated models, including the quantum mechanical atom.

The Bohr model was able to successfully explain certain characteristics of the hydrogen atom that were previously unexplained. Specifically, it provided an explanation for the bright line spectra of hydrogen. Bohr proposed that the electrons orbit the nucleus at specific, defined distances from the nucleus, called stationary orbits, and that light is emitted when an electron transitions between these stationary orbits. He showed that the energy difference between stationary orbits corresponds to the frequency of light emitted. This illuminated why the spectra of hydrogen contained discrete lines of specific, defined frequencies rather than a continuous spectrum. This model also allowed for calculating the radii of the orbits and matching them to known measurements. 

However, the Bohr model relies on classical assumptions that have since been disproven. It depicts the electron orbits as circular paths, like the orbits of planets around the sun, but we now know that electrons do not orbit the nucleus in any classical sense. Bohr assumed that electrons orbit at fixed distances from the nucleus, but we now understand that electrons exist in a probabilistic cloud around the nucleus. The model also assumed that the electrons orbit at fixed velocities and energies, when really, the electron energies are quantized and can have a range of values according to the electron's quantum numbers.

Most fundamentally, the Bohr model failed to recognize the wave nature of matter and assumed that particles move according to classical mechanics. We now know, according to quantum mechanics, that particles exhibit properties of both particles and waves. They do not move in strictly defined orbits. Bohr's model was not compatible with the discoveries of the wave nature of light and the wave-particle duality of matter that emerged around the same time. The Bohr model had to be replaced with a model based on quantum theory, like the quantum mechanical atom.

The successes of the Bohr model were largely despite its flaws and incorrect assumptions, not because of them. Its ability to explain the hydrogen spectrum was really a coincidence, and the model worked for hydrogen only because of its simplicity as an atom with one electron. The model did not extend well to atoms with more electrons. However, the Bohr model represented a major step forward in visualizing the atom in a physically concrete way, and it engaged important questions that fed into the emergence of quantum theory. So while fundamentally flawed, the Bohr model was a pioneering model that helped advance physics in its time before being replaced by a more complete quantum mechanical understanding of the atom.
