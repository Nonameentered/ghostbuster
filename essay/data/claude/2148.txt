Here is a draft essay in 1500 words on the topic:

There are two linguistic phenomena that involve a single word having multiple related meanings: homonymy and polysemy. Homonyms are words that share the same pronunciation and spelling but have distinct and unrelated meanings, such as bank (financial institution) and bank (edge of a river). Polysemy refers to a single word that has multiple related senses, such as the verb run, which can mean to move swiftly, to operate, or to flow. 

Distinguishing between homonymy and polysemy involves examining several criteria to determine if the meanings of a word are distinct or related. The first criterion is etymology, referring to the origin and historical development of the word. If the multiple senses of a word descend from different roots and historical origins, they are more likely to be homonyms. For example, the homonyms bark (dog sound) and bark (tree) derive from different Old English and Germanic roots. In contrast, the various senses of the polysemous word run all originate from the same Germanic root.

A second criterion is grammatical category and syntactic behavior. If the multiple senses belong to different grammatical categories or have different syntactic behaviors, they are more likely to be homonyms. For example, the noun club (weapon) and the verb club (hit) behave differently syntactically and semantically, signaling they are homonyms. The senses of polysemous run are all verbs, suggesting a relation.

A third criterion is semantic relation and metaphorical extension. Senses that are obviously related through metaphorical extension, metonymy, or semantic broadening are more indicative of polysemy. The senses of run, such as to physically move rapidly and to conduct or operate, are connected through metaphorical extension. Unrelated senses, like the homonyms club (weapon) and club (association), lack this semantic link.

Of the three criteria, the semantic relation between senses is the most effective method for identifying polysemy. Metaphorical and metonymic connections often subtly link the senses of polysemous words in non-random ways, even if etymology and syntax do not provide definitive evidence. However, no single criterion is entirely foolproof. Words can develop multiple senses in complex, intertwined ways over time. Some words may even start as homonyms and develop into polysemous senses or vice versa. Identification may also depend on which senses are dominant or fading from use at a given time.

In summary, several criteria can help distinguish homonymy from polysemy when words have multiple meanings, including etymological origin, grammatical category, and semantic relation between senses. Of these, semantic relation is the most effective method for identifying polysemy due to the metaphorical links that connect polysemous senses. Still, no criterion is completely categorical, and a combination of evidence may be needed to make a determination in complex cases. With an understanding of these concepts, linguists can analyze the relationship between word senses with more nuance.
