John Locke's justification of unlimited accumulation and inequality in property ownership in Chapter 5 of his Second Treatise of Government relies on contradictions and problematic assumptions. Locke argues that in the state of nature, individuals have natural rights to own and appropriate property, and to acquire as much property as possible through labour. However, Locke also recognizes natural limits to property accumulation based on spoilage and scarcity that contradict his argument for unlimited accumulation. Furthermore, Locke's argument assumes capitalist wage-labour relations in the state of nature that did not exist at the time.   

Locke bases his theory of property on natural law and natural rights that individuals possess in the state of nature. He argues that individuals own their own bodies and labour, and by mixing their labour with common resources in the state of nature, they come to own those resources as private property. Through labour, individuals appropriate common goods, remove them from the state of nature, and make them their own private property. Locke views this appropriation as a natural right that exists prior to the formation of civil society or government. 

However, Locke also recognizes that in the state of nature, the accumulation of property is limited by spoilage and scarcity. Since there is little use of money in this state, individuals can only appropriate as much as they can use before it spoils. Locke writes, "As much as any one can make use of to any advantage of life before it spoils; so much he may by his labour fix a Property in. Whatever is beyond this is more than his share, and belongs to others." This directly contradicts Locke's argument that individuals have a natural right to acquire unlimited property through their labour. If property accumulation is limited by use and spoilage, individuals do not have a right to appropriate more than they can use.

Locke further assumes capitalist wage-labour relations in the state of nature that did not exist at the time. He argues that those without property can sell their labour to acquire property, and can achieve unlimited accumulation over time through wage labour and money. However, wage labour relations require a capitalist system of property ownership and markets that did not exist in the state of nature. Locke imports assumptions from 17th century England into his conceptualization of the state of nature, ignoring the lack of capitalist institutions. 

To reconcile these contradictions, Locke argues that with the invention of money and division of labour, the natural limits on accumulation through use and spoilage disappear. Individuals can now accumulate more property than they can immediately use through money and exchange. Locke writes, "He that gathered a hundred bushels of acorns or apples, had thereby a property in them . . . before they spoiled . . . he might give them away in exchange . . . And thus, without any express Compact of all the Commoners, Money began to have a value." For Locke, money solves the problem of scarcity and spoilage, allowing for unlimited accumulation.
 
However, the invention of money itself relies on social relations and institutions, not natural rights or the state of nature. Locke imports assumptions of money and markets into his conceptualization of the state of nature to justify inequality and defend unlimited accumulation, even though the conditions required for such accumulation only exist within society. Locke's attempt to reconcile natural limits on property with unlimited accumulation is unpersuasive, as his justification relies on institutions external to the state of nature rather than natural rights alone. Overall, Locke's argument is marked by contradictions regarding the limits of natural property rights, and assumptions of capitalist social relations in the state of nature that undermine his conceptualization of unlimited accumulation as a natural right.
