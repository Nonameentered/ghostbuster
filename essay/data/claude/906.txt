The development of Hong Kong and Singapore in the latter half of the 20th century has been remarkable. From developing countries in the 1960s, Hong Kong and Singapore rapidly transformed into major global financial and trade hubs with high standards of living. Their developmental trajectories have been studied as models by other developing countries. However, the extent to which the theories of the "developmental state" apply to explain their success is debatable. 

The developmental state theory argues that a proactive state apparatus plays a key role in promoting economic growth during the early stages of development. A developmental state has a high degree of autonomy and competence to pursue a clear strategic vision for economic development. It is able to foster close ties with the private sector to align business interests with national economic goals. Both Hong Kong and Singapore exhibited some aspects of a developmental state. Their civil services were highly effective and guided the economies with export-oriented industrialization strategies. Yet, there were also key differences. Hong Kong followed a laissez-faire model with minimal government intervention. Its civil service played a regulatory role but did not steer private sector interests in the way typical of developmental states like South Korea or Taiwan. Singapore also had a more pronounced role of government in promoting targeted industries through state-owned enterprises and industrial policy. 

In other ways, Hong Kong and Singapore were atypical of most developing economies. They were small city-states with populations largely made up of immigrants. They did not have an agricultural base or a need to industrialize to employ surplus labor from rural areas. Their location as trade hubs with ports gave them a geographical advantage for export-oriented trade and finance. These unique conditions allowed Hong Kong and Singapore to leapfrog traditional paths toward industrialization and quickly move into higher value-added sectors like finance and technology. 

Notwithstanding their peculiarities, there are still lessons that can be drawn from the Hong Kong and Singapore models of development. A competent and focused civil service, a market-friendly environment, heavy investment in human capital, and openness to global trade and finance were instrumental to their ascent. However, their experiences would be difficult to replicate without favorable geographic and demographic conditions as well as established links to global trade networks.

In conclusion, while Hong Kong and Singapore exhibited some features associated with the developmental state, there were also key differences. Their conditions were in many ways sui generis, enabling a trajectory that would not suit most developing countries. Still, useful policy lessons on the roles of government and the market in the early stages of development can be drawn from studying their successful experiments in economic transformation. Overall, the developmental state paradigm only partly applies to explaining the rise of Hong Kong and Singapore. A combination of policy factors and luck also contributed to their status as models of economic development.
