Here is a draft 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

The weather conditions during the "Experiencing the Weather" field weekend near Swanage in Dorset, England in 2006 reflected significant daily and hourly variations caused by the region's proximity to the coast and ocean. The observed changes in temperature, humidity, wind, and other factors demonstrate how coastal areas and large water bodies can influence local weather patterns over short timescales. 

The daily progression of weather during the field weekend followed a pattern consistent with the area's location on the coast of the English Channel. Temperatures rose during the day as the land surface warmed under the sun, reaching maximum temperatures in the mid-to-late afternoon around 15 degrees Celsius. As the sun set in the evening, land temperatures cooled quickly while the ocean temperature remained steady, resulting in higher relative humidity levels overnight as the air mass over land approached saturation. Winds also shifted directions and speeds, blowing onshore during the day as the land heated and offshore at night as the temperature gradient reversed.

Within this daily cycle, however, there were significant short-term fluctuations that depended on local factors like cloud cover, precipitation, and the specific location of measurements. When the sun was obscured by dense cloud cover in the morning and early afternoon of the first day, temperatures rose only slowly and peak temperatures were 3-4 degrees lower than the following day which saw more direct solar radiation. Precipitation events, whether light rain showers or heavier showers, caused abrupt drops in temperature and subsequent rises in humidity as water vapor condensed and heat was released during condensation. 

Measurements also varied based on location, especially proximity to the coastline and ocean. Data from a weather station at the top of a hill a couple kilometers from the coast showed greater extremes than a station at the beach, which remained steadier due to the moderating influence of the sea. Humidity was higher at the beach station overnight as offshore winds blew moist air from over the ocean to the land, while humidity remained lower inland without this maritime influence. 

The tephigrams, which plot temperature and humidity changes, displayed instability in the lower atmosphere for parts of the field weekend. Adiabatic cooling of air parcels as they rose caused condensation and instability that led to precipitation. The tephigrams also highlighted the daily cycle of heating and cooling near the surface, with warmer, moister conditions during the day and cooler, drier conditions at night that depended on radiational cooling as the ground lost heat.

In summary, the field weekend highlighted the significant impacts of proximity to large water bodies on local weather and climate. While daily temperature cycles followed expected patterns, the ocean contributed to variability in humidity, precipitation, wind, and temperature that differed from conditions further inland. Analyzing data from multiple locations and using tephigrams to assess atmospheric stability revealed these complex interactions and how they drove the short-term weather changes observed during an autumn weekend on the south coast of England.
