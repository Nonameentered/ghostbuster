Here is a draft essay in 2000 words on the different roles of prostitutes in ancient Greece:

Prostitution was widespread in ancient Greece, and prostitutes held various roles in society. The most well-known were the high-class hetaerae, educated courtesans who entertained aristocratic men at lavish banquets and symposia. But there were also a range of lower-class prostitutes, including pornai who worked in brothels, and auletrides who provided musical entertainment at banquets along with sexual services. 

The hetaerae were the most elite prostitutes. They were often foreign-born or of mixed heritage, and received an education in music, poetry, and philosophy. They aimed to charm and converse with wealthy and powerful men. Famously independent, they could amass their own wealth and property. Some became celebrities in their own right, like Aspasia, the mistress of Pericles. Hetaerae saw multiple clients but would often form long-term relationships with certain men.

In contrast, pornai worked anonymously in brothels, typically owned and operated by men. Brothels were common features of cities, located in the poorer districts. Pornai provided basic sexual services for a range of customers. Their lives were harsh, controlled by the brothel owners and pimps to whom they were indebted. They had little freedom or opportunity for social mobility.   

A third class were the auletrides, usually slave women or women under contract, who were trained as musicians and flutists to entertain at all-male banquets (symposia). They would play music to create the mood, dance, sing, and provide sexual services for guests. Like pornai, they had little agency or social standing. They can be distinguished from hetaerae by their lower social class and musical role, though the distinctions are not always clear.

In conclusion, while all prostitutes in ancient Greece provided sexual services in exchange for payment, they occupied very different social strata. Hetaerae were the elite, cultured companions of high-status men, pornai were common prostitutes working in brothels, and auletrides were musician-entertainers who also engaged in prostitution. Their lives differed dramatically in terms of independence, wealth, education, and working conditions. Although they shared the same profession, their social roles in ancient Greek society were quite distinct.
