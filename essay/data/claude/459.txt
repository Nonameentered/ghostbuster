Voter turnout in the United States is substantially lower compared to most other democratic nations. In recent years, voter turnout in presidential elections has ranged between 50 to 60 percent, much lower than almost all other developed democracies. There are several complex sociological, demographic, and political reasons for low voter turnout in America. 

One major reason for low voter turnout is apathy and alienation. Many Americans, especially those in disadvantaged socioeconomic groups, feel disconnected from the political process and believe their votes do not matter. They think politicians do not care about their interests and that election outcomes will not change their daily lives in meaningful ways. This apathy and cynicism is more prevalent among younger citizens, minorities, and those with lower income and education levels. Overcoming these perceptions and beliefs is challenging but critical to increasing voter participation.

Socio-demographic factors also strongly correlate with voter turnout. Older, more educated, and higher-income citizens vote at much higher rates than others. In the 2016 election, over 70% of citizens over 65 years old voted, compared to just 46% of 18-29-year-olds. Similarly, over 80% of those with a bachelor's degree voted, compared to 52% of those without a high school diploma. Higher-income individuals also vote at higher rates. These socioeconomic disparities in turnout threaten to skew policymaking in favor of more advantaged groups. Targeted get-out-the-vote campaigns may help address these imbalances.

Institutional and political factors also contribute to lower voter turnout in the U.S. The U.S. is one of the only major democracies with neither compulsory voting nor Election Day as a national holiday. Holding elections on a workday poses difficulties for many citizens to get to the polls. The U.S. also has a relatively complex federal system with separate voter registrations for state and federal elections. Furthermore, the electoral college and winner-take-all systems mean that many Americans live in "safe states" where their votes seem unlikely to change the outcome. Reforming these systems may help increase voter participation.  

In recent years, there is evidence that the role of individual factors in voter turnout is declining relative to more structural factors. Get-out-the-vote campaigns focused on individuals, while important, can only do so much to overcome the sociological, institutional and political obstacles that drive down turnout. Broad democratic reforms, from automatic voter registration to making Election Day a holiday, are likely needed to significantly raise voter participation in America. Overall, increasing voter turnout in the U.S. will require a suite of cultural, social and political changes to make the act of voting more accessible, incentivized and habitual for citizens. But higher turnout should remain a goal because it is fundamental to a healthy democratic system that represents all citizens.
