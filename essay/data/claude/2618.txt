Artificial Neural Networks have been employed in recent research to analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) data from Parkinson's Disease patients and predict abnormal spontaneous neural activity, specifically tremors. By analyzing the brain wave patterns that precede tremors, researchers aim to develop closed-loop deep brain stimulation systems that can detect and suppress tremors in real time.

Parkinson's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that leads to loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the midbrain. This loss of dopamine leads to impairments in motor function, including tremors, muscle rigidity, and difficulty initiating movement. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) involves implanting electrodes in the brain that deliver high frequency electrical stimulation to specific areas like the subthalamic nucleus to suppress motor symptoms. However, current DBS systems deliver constant stimulation regardless of a patient's symptoms at any given time. This can lead to side effects like speech problems, dizziness, and balance issues due to overstimulation.  

An adaptive, closed-loop DBS system that can detect and respond to symptoms in real time could mitigate these side effects by only stimulating when needed. Artificial neural networks, models inspired by biological neural networks, have shown promise in analyzing EEG data to predict when tremors may occur. For example, a 2018 study trained a convolutional neural network on 15 Parkinson's patients who had undergone DBS surgery. The network analyzed low-frequency EEG signals to detect abnormal burst-like patterns that preceded tremors, achieving over 80% accuracy in predicting tremors up to 6 seconds before onset.

Such predictive models could be integrated into an adaptive DBS system with electrodes that also record EEG signals. By constantly monitoring a patient's brain activity, the system could detect when a tremor is likely to occur in the next few seconds and stimulate as needed to suppress the tremor before symptoms manifest. The system could start with a calibration period where stimulation is triggered manually by a physician observing the patient or in response to detected tremors. The neural network would then continue learning to better predict tremors over time for that specific patient.  

Overall, Parkinson's tremors and other movement disorders may be alleviated using artificial neural networks to build closed-loop DBS systems. By detecting the abnormal neural patterns that precede tremors, these systems can provide stimulation on demand to mitigate symptoms while reducing adverse effects. However, there are still challenges to address including detecting tremors several minutes in advance, personalizing predictions and stimulation for individual patients, and improving neural network accuracy. With continued research, adaptive DBS holds promise for significantly improving quality of life for people living with Parkinson's Disease and other movement disorders.
