Here is a 622-word essay in response to the prompt:

Water potential is the measurement of the tendency of a plant cell to gain or lose water. It depends on two factors: solute potential and pressure potential. Solute potential refers to the concentration of dissolved ions and other solutes in the cell sap. The higher the concentration of solutes, the lower the solute potential and the lower the overall water potential. Pressure potential refers to the pressure exerted by the cell wall onto the protoplast. The rigid cell wall encloses the cell membrane and cytoplasm, and as water enters the cell by osmosis, it exerts pressure that can counteract further net water movement. 

An experiment can be conducted to investigate osmosis in plant cells using potato tubers. Potato tubers contain many parenchyma cells that are suitable for observing osmosis. First, select a fresh potato and cut one end to produce an even, flat surface. Then, use a cork borer or knife to cut four equally sized and shaped discs from the potato. 

Next, prepare four solutions with different concentrations: 0.2M, 0.4M, 0.6M, and 0.8M sucrose. The 0.2M solution will have a high water potential, while the 0.8M solution will have a low water potential. Place one potato disc in each solution. Leave the discs for 24 hours to allow osmosis to occur.

After 24 hours, remove the discs and record their mass. The discs in 0.2M and 0.4M solutions will gain mass, while the discs in 0.6M and 0.8M solutions will lose mass. This is because water will move from a region of high water potential (the dilute solutions) to a region of low water potential (the concentrated solutions) down its potential gradient. The gain or loss in mass indicates the net movement of water, which depends on the relative water potentials of the potato tissues and the surrounding solution.

The results confirm that osmosis does take place across the membranes of potato cells in response to differences in water potential across the membranes. Water moves to areas with lower water potential, causing the potato discs to either swell or shrink depending on the molarity of sucrose solutions. This experiment proves that water potential and osmosis are inherently linked in plant cells. Cells placed in a solution with lower water potential (higher solute concentration) lose water by osmosis, while cells in a higher water potential solution gain water. The movement of water will continue until the water potential across the membrane is equal.
