Role of Reducing Agents in SDS-PAGE and Their Importance

SDS-PAGE, or sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is an important biochemistry technique used to separate proteins based on their molecular weight. Reducing agents, such as dithiothreitol (DTT) or beta-mercaptoethanol (BME), play a crucial role in SDS-PAGE by reducing disulfide bonds in proteins. Disulfide bonds link cysteine amino acids within a protein or between proteins and can create distortions in the separation by molecular weight. Reducing agents cleave these disulfide bonds to denature the proteins into their individual subunits, allowing for more accurate separation by molecular weight.

To determine the molecular weight of unknown proteins, a standard curve is generated using proteins of known molecular weight. By plotting the log of the molecular weight versus the distance traveled in the gel, a standard curve is produced. Using this standard curve, the molecular weights of unknown proteins can be estimated based on their band migration distance in the gel. For example, if unknown protein 1 traveled 45mm in the gel and unknown protein 2 traveled 35mm, using the standard curve, the molecular weight of unknown protein 1 would be approximately 66kDa while unknown protein 2 would be around 101kDa.  

Several enzymes were mentioned as examples. Triose-phosphate isomerase is an enzyme involved in glycolysis that converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate and lactate and plays an important role in anaerobic cellular respiration. Ovalbumin is the main protein found in egg white and is frequently used as a protein standard. Pyruvate kinase is another glycolytic enzyme that converts phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP to pyruvate and ATP. Fructose-6-phosphate kinase phosphorylates fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate as part of glycolysis. Finally, beta-galactosidase is an enzyme that cleaves lactose into glucose and galactose. These enzymes all play important roles in energy production and metabolism.  

In conclusion, reducing agents reduce disulfide bonds in proteins to enable accurate separation by molecular weight using SDS-PAGE. A standard curve allows estimation of the molecular weights of unknown proteins based on their migration distance. The enzymes triose-phosphate isomerase, lactate dehydrogenase, ovalbumin, pyruvate kinase, fructose-6-phosphate kinase, and beta-galactosidase are all important for metabolism and cellular respiration. Reducing agents and SDS-PAGE are invaluable tools for studying proteins and enzymes.
