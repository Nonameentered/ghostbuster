The procedure for controlling two 7-segment LED displays to display a count when specific switches were pressed involved several steps. First, the author had to enable the port that the switches were connected to on the M16 development board and set that port as the input port. The author also had to enable the port connected to the 7-segment LED displays and set that port as the output port. 

Next, the author had to write code that would continuously check if any of the switches were pressed. This involved using a "while true" loop to continuously poll the switch input port. Within that loop, the author used "if" statements to check if Switch 1, Switch 2, or both switches were pressed. If Switch 1 was pressed, the count displayed on the 7-segment LEDs would increment by 1. If Switch 2 was pressed, the count would decrement by 1. If both switches were pressed, the count would reset to 0.

The author then had to determine the hexadecimal values needed to display the numbers 0 through 9 on the 7-segment LEDs. The author referenced the datasheet for the LEDs to determine which LEDs to illuminate to display which numbers. The author created a "lookup table" with these values. Depending on the current count value, the author would reference the lookup table to determine which value to output to the port controlling the 7-segment LEDs in order to display that number.

This lab improved the author's knowledge of coding by providing practice with switch polling, port control, lookup tables, and displaying outputs. The author gained valuable experience controlling basic input and output electronic devices programmatically. Working with the M16 board specifically improved the author's ability to configure ports and connect external devices to the board. Overall, this lab exercise expanded the author's skills in embedded systems development and applying C/C++ coding to interact with hardware.
