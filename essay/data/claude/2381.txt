The Forestry Commission plays an important role in providing forest and woodland planting materials in the U.K, conducting forestry research to support multiple objectives, and ensuring information and services are available to the public.  

The Forestry Commission is responsible for raising and distributing millions of tree seedlings each year to support new woodland creation and restocking programs across the country. The seed used comes from seed stands and seed orchards that have been specially selected to provide trees suitable for the diversity of climates and soils found in the U.K. The Forestry Commission operates several tree nurseries to raise seedlings to meet the needs of private and public sector woodland owners. The scale of operation and scientific expertise available to the Forestry Commission means that it is uniquely placed to provide tree stock for large scale planting initiatives as well as supporting small woodland owners.

The Forestry Commission also carries out research on tree improvement, pest and disease control, forest management techniques and other areas to support sustainable forestry that balances multiple objectives. Taking the Hangers woodlands as an example, the Forestry Commission acquired much of this land in the early 20th century with the original aim of producing timber. However, management objectives have since broadened to include recreation, nature conservation, and the protection of landscape character. Forestry research by the Commission has supported this transition by developing silvicultural techniques that can produce timber in a way that is sensitive to the environment and landscape, and by investigating ways to improve the biodiversity and recreational value of woodlands. 

The Forestry Commission has a duty to provide information and services to those who own, manage and use woodlands. It does this through its publications, training courses, and online resources which provide guidance on good forestry practice. The Commission also provides grants and regulations to support sustainable woodland management. Locally, Forestry Commission staff provide advice and support to help woodland owners and community groups achieve their objectives. The Hangers, for example, has an active group of volunteers who help manage the woodlands for the benefit of wildlife and visitors. The Forestry Commission works with these volunteer groups to facilitate their activities through providing information, training, and helping them obtain resources. 

In conclusion, the Forestry Commission plays a crucial role in supporting forestry across the U.K. through providing planting stock, conducting research on sustainable woodland management, and ensuring information and services are available to woodland owners, managers and users. Taking the example of the Hangers woodlands, the Forestry Commission has enabled the transition from a timber-focused forest to a multi-purpose woodland that provides benefits for wildlife, visitors and the local landscape character. With increasing challenges from pests, diseases, climate change and societal pressures, the Forestry Commission's work will continue to be vital for the future of forests in the U.K.
