The purpose of the experiment involving a circuit with resistance and inductance connected in series was to observe the effects of inductance and capacitance on alternating current circuits. By constructing circuits with different numbers of coil turns, we were able to see how inductance depends on the number of turns and coil geometry. We also explored how adding a capacitor to the circuit can counteract the effects of an inductor and allow higher frequency signals to pass through.

For the first part of the experiment, we constructed three coils with 50, 100, and 200 turns respectively. When connected to an AC power supply, we measured the voltage drop across each coil and used Ohm's law to calculate the impedance. We found that impedance increased with the number of turns, indicating that inductance is directly proportional to the number of coil turns. The inductance values we calculated for the 50, 100, and 200-turn coils were 0.041 H, 0.164 H, and 0.659 H respectively. These results demonstrate how inductance depends on the physical properties of the coil. 

When we added the capacitors to the circuit, we saw that the voltage drop across the coils decreased as the capacitance increased. At a certain critical capacitance value, the voltage drop became zero, indicating that the capacitive reactance equaled the inductive reactance. At this point, the capacitor fully canceled out the inductor, allowing the AC signal to pass through the circuit. The critical capacitance values were 680 nF for the 50-turn coil, 270 nF for the 100-turn coil, and 121 nF  for the 200-turn coil. 

These results highlight the inverse relationship between capacitive and inductive reactance. As frequency increases, capacitive reactance decreases and inductive reactance increases. When they are equal in magnitude, they cancel each other out. The voltage drop across the parallel capacitor-inductor circuit becomes zero, meaning the circuit will allow the higher frequency signals to pass through.

To further explore the relationship between frequency and reactance, we introduced a function generator to the circuit and slowly increased the frequency over a range of values. We found that for lower frequencies, the voltage drop across the inductor was high while the voltage drop across the capacitor was low, indicating dominant inductive reactance. As the frequency increased, the voltage across the capacitor increased while it decreased across the inductor. At the resonant frequency, the voltage across both components was maximized, showing that the inductive and capacitive reactances were equal. For even higher frequencies, the voltage across the capacitor continued to increase while it dropped to nearly zero across the inductor, demonstrating dominant capacitive reactance.

These results illustrate the concept of harmonics in circuits and how inductors act as low-pass filters. At lower frequencies, the inductive reactance is high, allowing lower frequency signals to pass through while filtering out higher frequencies. As frequency increases, the inductive reactance increases and begins to filter out more of the signal. Capacitors, on the other hand, have an inverse relationship and act as high-pass filters, allowing higher frequency signals to pass through while filtering lower frequencies. By combining inductors and capacitors, we can construct band-pass filters that allow only a certain range of frequencies to pass through.

In summary, the experiment provided an opportunity to explore how inductance depends upon coil properties, how capacitance can be used to counteract inductance, the relationship between frequency and reactance, and how inductors act as low-pass harmonics filters. By understanding these concepts and how they relate in circuits, we can more effectively analyze, design, and build devices that utilize alternating current. Overall, the experiment was a useful instructional exercise in understanding fundamentals of AC circuit theory and analysis.
