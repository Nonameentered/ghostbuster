There are several techniques used to study the microstructure of materials at the crystal level. These methods allow scientists to analyze the properties of crystals and understand their microscopic structure and behaviour.

One common method is X-ray diffraction. X-ray beams are directed at a crystal sample and the pattern of diffracted X-rays is measured. By analyzing the angles and intensities of the diffracted beams, the structure of the crystal lattice can be determined, including lattice parameters, symmetry, and atomic positions. X-ray diffraction is useful for studying the long-range order and periodicity of crystal structures. 

Electron microscopy is another important technique. Electron microscopes use a beam of accelerated electrons rather than light to illuminate the sample. Electron microscopes have much higher magnification and resolution than traditional light microscopes, allowing visualization of individual atoms. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) scans the sample with a focused electron beam to form an image. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) transmits an electron beam through a thin sample, projecting an image onto a fluorescent screen or photographic film. Electron microscopy enables analysis of crystal defects, phases, and microstructures at the nanometer scale.

Atom probe tomography (APT) is a technique that provides three-dimensional elemental mapping at the atomic scale. APT uses a strong electric field to evaporate atoms from the surface of a needle-shaped sample and determines the mass-to-charge ratio of each ion to identify the element and measure its location. APT can achieve sub-nanometer resolution and parts-per-million sensitivity, enabling precise mapping of dopant or alloy distributions in materials. APT provides useful insights into atomic-level microstructures and interactions.

In summary, techniques such as X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography provide powerful methods to probe the microstructure of materials at the crystal level. By using multiple methods together, a more complete picture of a material's structure and properties can be obtained. These microstructural analysis techniques have enabled significant advances in materials science and engineering.
