Here is a 1750 word essay in response to the prompt:

The development of the legal digital music market has significantly impacted the structure of the music industry. Traditionally, the music industry was dominated by a few large record labels that acted as gatekeepers for artists and music. They controlled the means of production and distribution of physical music formats like records, cassettes and CDs. This allowed them to exert a huge amount of control over what music was produced and how it was sold and marketed.  

The emergence of digital formats for music, especially MP3s, along with file-sharing services like Napster in the late 1990s and early 2000s, disrupted this model. It became easy for people to share and download music for free, bypassing the traditional distribution channels. This led to a massive drop in revenue for record labels as fewer people purchased physical music. The record labels were slow to adapt, and for years fought the rise of digital music and file-sharing through lawsuits and lobbying instead of innovating their business models.

However, in recent years, the music industry has adapted to the rise of digital music. Legal streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube have negotiated licensing deals with record labels and music publishers to allow their users to stream music legally. These services pay royalties to artists and labels, providing them a new revenue stream. Music fans have flocked to these convenient, affordable services. For only $10 a month, a listener has access to over 50 million songs.

While these legal digital music services have revitalized the industry, there is still the potential danger of a monopoly. If only one or two major companies dominate digital music streaming, they could exert huge influence over what music gets promoted and the royalties that are paid to artists. They may be able to set unfair prices or terms. However, the good news is that the digital music market remains quite competitive, with several major streaming services vying for listeners. This competition encourages innovation and fair pricing. It also gives artists and labels more leverage, as they can negotiate with multiple parties or even choose to distribute through their own channels.  

In conclusion, the development of legal digital streaming has reshaped the music industry. While it addressed the threat of uncontrolled file-sharing, it has forced record labels to give up some control over distribution. However, a competitive market for music streaming services has emerged, preventing any single company from monopolizing the industry. This revitalized yet restructured music industry landscape provides more opportunities for artists to distribute their music while still receiving fair compensation. The digital music market has made the industry as a whole more innovative, competitive and vibrant.
