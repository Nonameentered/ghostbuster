Max Weber proposed a tripartite system of social stratification based on class, status, and party. Class refers to a person's economic position in a society based on their income, wealth, and occupational prestige. Status refers to a person's social prestige or honor that is derived from non-economic attributes like ethnicity, race, religion, and lifestyle choices. Party refers to a person's political power and influence within a society. 

This tripartite conceptualization of stratification has been influential in contemporary sociology. Many sociologists have adopted Weber's multidimensional view of stratification, arguing that class, status, and power are all essential to understanding inequality in society. Purely economic or materialist theories that focus only on class are limited. Status groups and political affiliations also shape life chances and access to resources.

At the same time, Weber's tripartite system has been critiqued for being too rigid and static. Contemporary sociologists argue that class, status, and party are deeply intertwined, rather than separate dimensions of stratification. For example, class position shapes opportunities for status attainment and political influence. Racial status groups are linked to specific class and political trajectories. Political parties advocate for the interests of particular class and status groups. Social mobility is shaped jointly by changes in class, status, and political position.

Feminist sociologists have extended Weber's theory by examining how gender interacts with class, status, and power to shape stratification. They have shown how women face disadvantages in the class system due to the gendered division of labor, the status system due to social constructions of gender roles, and the political system due to systemic underrepresentation and disempowerment. Intersectional scholars argue that race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and other dimensions of identity also intersect with class, status, and power in complex ways.

In sum, Weber's tripartite conceptualization of stratification based on class, status, and power laid the groundwork for a multidimensional approach to inequality that has been adopted and extended in contemporary sociology. While the theory has been critiqued for portraying these dimensions as too separate, Weber highlighted the key role that both economic and social factors play in distributing life chances and shaping mobility in society. The tripartite system has proven foundational for contemporary theories of intersectionality and inequality. Overall, Weber's insightful theory of social stratification continues to shape debates in contemporary sociology.
