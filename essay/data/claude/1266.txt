The introduction of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) in 2005 represented a major change to the system of agricultural subsidies and payments for suckler cow farmers in the UK. Whereas previously, subsidies were linked to production and the number of animals a farmer kept under schemes such as the Suckler Cow Premium Scheme (SCPS) and the Beef Special Premium Scheme (BSP), the SPS was based on the total area of agricultural land that a farmer managed.  

Under the SCPS and BSP, farmers received payments for each animal they kept, encouraging them to maximize the size of their herds to gain higher subsidy payments. However, this often led to overproduction and lower market prices for beef. The SPS aimed to decouple subsidies from production by providing a single payment based on the amount of land farmed instead. This gave farmers more flexibility and freedom to react to market forces in determining the size of their herd.

For some suckler cow farmers, the SPS meant a loss of income compared to the SCPS and BSP. Farmers who had built up large herds to maximize subsidies under the previous schemes now received the same payment regardless of herd size. Those with smaller herds and more land, however, gained from the transition to the SPS. The SPS provided them a higher total payment for the land they farmed. 

Under the SPS, all farmers received a payment per hectare of agricultural land. The total payment was calculated based on the number of entitlements a farmer held - one entitlement was issued per hectare of eligible land up to a farmerâ€™s maximum eligible area. Entitlements were transferable, so farmers could buy or sell them to increase or decrease their total SPS payment. This allowed some flexibility for farmers to adapt to the new payment system.

The impact of the SPS varied regionally across the UK based on differences in farm sizes, herd sizes, land values, and the beef and cattle markets. In remote upland areas where farms were typically larger in size but less productive, the SPS often meant lower subsidy payments. In more productive lowland areas where farms were smaller, the SPS frequently resulted in increased payments for farmers.
