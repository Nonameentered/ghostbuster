Flash photolysis is a technique used to study short-lived transient species and reaction intermediates. It involves using an intense light pulse, or “flash”, to initiate a photochemical reaction and generate the transient species of interest. The transient species are then monitored as they decay over time using a variety of spectroscopic techniques. Flash photolysis was used by Kauffman et al. in 1966 to measure the lifetime of the lowest triplet excited state of anthracene.

The aim of Kauffman’s experiment was to determine the lifetime of the anthracene triplet state, which was believed to be a few microseconds based on indirect measurements. Flash photolysis provided a direct way to measure this lifetime by generating the triplet state with a light pulse and then monitoring its decay in real time. The experiment involved dissolving anthracene in cyclohexane solution and flushing out oxygen, which can quench the triplet state. A light pulse from a flash lamp generated the anthracene triplet state, which was detected by observing the decrease in the anthracene fluorescence over time. The decay in fluorescence corresponded to the decay of the triplet state back to the ground state. 

By varying the time delay between the flash and the excitation of the fluorescence, and measuring the resulting fluorescence intensities, Kauffman was able to determine the lifetime of the anthracene triplet state to be 5.3 microseconds. This was a groundbreaking direct measurement of a short-lived molecular excited state. However, there were sources of potential error that may have affected the results. Trace amounts of oxygen may have remained in the solution and quenched some triplet states. The intensity and duration of the flash may have varied slightly between experiments. The detection method relied on monitoring decreases in fluorescence, so any fluctuations in the fluorescence may have introduced error. Despite these issues, Kauffman’s results were internally consistent and groundbreaking for their time.

In summary, flash photolysis provided a way to directly generate and measure the lifetime of the fleeting lowest triplet excited state of anthracene for the first time. Though certain errors may have influenced the results, the experiment represented a novel application of flash photolysis for understanding molecular excited state dynamics. Overall, Kauffman’s study was a milestone in the development of ultrafast laser spectroscopy techniques.
