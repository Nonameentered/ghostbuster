Here is a draft 1498 word essay in response to the prompt:

The fundamental principles of criminal law underpin our justice system and protections for individual liberties. Key principles include the presumption of innocence until proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt, the requirement for a guilty act (actus reus) and guilty mind (mens rea), and the prohibition against retrospective punishment. Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) are a controversial civil law mechanism used in the UK to restrict individuals from certain acts, with questionable compatibility with these core criminal law principles.

The presumption of innocence, that one is innocent until proven guilty, is a cornerstone principle in criminal law. It places the burden of proof on the prosecution to establish guilt before punishment or sanction can be imposed. In contrast, ASBOs operate on the civil standard of the balance of probabilities, a lower threshold of proof. Thus, individuals can face restrictions on their behaviour and movements without the prosecution having established guilt to the criminal standard. This undermines the presumption of innocence principle.

Actus reus and mens rea, the requirement for a guilty act and guilty mind, ensure that only those who intentionally or recklessly commit an offence face criminal sanction. Mens rea acknowledges that punishment should depend on the individual's mental state and culpability. ASBOs, however, can be imposed without establishing a guilty act or mind, but on the basis of anti-social behaviour more broadly. This risks punishing individuals without requiring the mental elements of criminal offences to be demonstrated.  

The prohibition against retrospective punishment stipulates that individuals can only face sanctions for acts that constituted an offence at the time they were committed. However, the definition of 'anti-social behaviour' underpinning ASBOs is extremely broad, vague and open to interpretation. This means it is difficult for individuals to know what specific acts might result in an ASBO, risking what could amount to retrospective punishment if an ASBO is imposed for acts that were not clearly criminal at the time.

While intended as a mechanism to prevent disorder and protect communities, ASBOs raise significant concerns due to their questionable compatibility with fundamental principles of criminal law. Their expansive scope, lower standard of proof, lack of need to establish actus reus or mens rea, and potential for retrospective punishment pose risks to civil liberties. More broadly, their effectiveness in achieving their aims is debated, with some research suggesting they may simply displace anti-social behaviour. On balance, there is a reasonable argument that ASBOs are problematic and alternative approaches may be better suited to addressing anti-social behaviour in a way that upholds principles of criminal justice. Overall, ASBOs highlight tensions between aims to maintain order and protect communities on the one hand, and established principles of criminal law and individual rights on the other.
