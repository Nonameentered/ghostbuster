The Treasure Houses of England is a marketing campaign to promote some of the most significant historic houses and estates in England to both domestic and international visitors. The overarching objectives of the campaign are:

1. Increase visitor numbers to the participating historic houses and estates. By enhancing the profile and awareness of these properties, the campaign aims to attract more visitors, especially from overseas.

2. Showcase the diverse range of art collections and architectural heritage that these properties contain. The historic houses contain some of the finest art collections, furniture, tapestries, and other decorative arts, as well as beautiful gardens and architecture. The marketing campaign highlights the depth and breadth of the collections to appeal to art and history lovers. 

3. Drive tourism revenue and support the local tourism economy. By bringing in more visitors, the marketing campaign generates additional ticket sales and retail revenues for the historic properties. It also supports the wider tourism economy through visitors spending money on food, accommodation, and other services.

The main strategies to achieve these objectives include:

- Developing an appealing brand and online portal to promote the collective properties. The Treasure Houses of England brand and website raise the visibility and prestige of the properties.

- Conducting marketing and promotional campaigns, especially targeting international visitors. Campaigns include social media marketing, advertising, media engagement, travel trade outreach, and collaboration with tourism partners like Visit England.

- Organizing events and exhibitions to showcase the properties. Special events, tours, and exhibitions are designed to highlight specific artworks, themes, or seasonal attractions to give visitors unique experiences. 

- Providing ticket packages and special offers to boost visits. Integrated ticketing and special bundled offers make it easy and affordable for visitors to tour multiple properties.

The success of the campaign will be measured through key performance indicators such as increases in visitor numbers, revenue, website visitors, and social media engagement. Surveys and studies will also track the overall awareness of the Treasure Houses of England brand and gauge visitor satisfaction and intention to make repeat visits or recommend the properties to others. The campaign aims to make the historic houses "must-see" destinations, especially for international visitors traveling to England.
