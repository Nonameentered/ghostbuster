The traditional understanding of early Neolithic settlement patterns in the British Isles held that farming populations migrating from continental Europe brought agriculture to Britain around 4000 BCE and established permanent farming villages. However, recent evidence suggests a more complex pattern of seasonal migration and temporary occupation of seasonal camps. This new understanding provides insight into how the Neolithic way of life evolved to adapt to the local environment and climate.

The earliest Neolithic migrants to Britain, around 4000 BCE, are thought to have practiced a mixture of farming and hunting/gathering. They likely lived in temporary seasonal camps and migrated to follow resources, rather than establishing permanent agricultural villages right away. Evidence for seasonal migration comes from sites like Hambledon Hill, where archaeologists found remnants of structures that appear to have been occupied only seasonally, perhaps in the summer. Isotope analysis of human remains also suggests a diet based on both domesticated and wild foods.   

Over time, as populations grew and farming practices adapted to the climate, more permanent agricultural villages began to develop, around 3800-3500 BCE. Sites like Skara Brae in Orkney provide evidence of year-round settlement and farming. However, seasonal migration and temporary camps were still utilized, especially in marginal areas like uplands or wetlands. A mixed subsistence strategy of farming, herding, hunting, and gathering was likely most practical and reduced risk.

Several factors drove the gradual shift to more permanent, agricultural villages. Population growth placed demands on resources and required more intensive farming. Developing new crop varieties and agricultural techniques adapted to the local climate made year-round farming more viable. Trade with continental Europe also brought new domesticated animals, crops, and technologies that enabled settlement.   

In conclusion, the traditional notion of early Neolithic farmers establishing permanent agricultural villages shortly after migrating to Britain has been revised. A more complex pattern of seasonal migration, temporary occupation, and gradual development of year-round farming villages is now understood. This evolution was influenced by population growth, adaptations to environment and climate, and trade with continental Europe. The Neolithic way of life was not static but rather dynamic, as human populations interacted with and adapted to the landscapes they inhabited.
