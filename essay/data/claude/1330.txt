Recent reforms in England and Wales, including the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 (CPIA 1996) and the Attorney General's Guidelines on Disclosure, have aimed to clarify and expand the obligations of the prosecution to disclose evidence to the defense. However, these reforms have raised concerns about whether expanded disclosure requirements undermine key tenets of the adversarial system, including the privilege against self-incrimination and the requirement that the prosecution proves the defendant's guilt.

The CPIA 1996 codified and expanded the prosecution's duty to disclose "unused material" that may undermine the prosecution case or assist the defense.  This includes disclosing witness statements, forensic evidence, and other documents even if the prosecution does not intend to rely on them in court. The Attorney General's Guidelines further obliged the prosecution to pursue "reasonable lines of inquiry" and disclose any evidence thereby uncovered. Studies show these reforms have significantly increased the volume of evidence disclosed to the defense.

Some argue this enhanced disclosure compromises the privilege against self-incrimination, as defendants are obliged to disclose defenses and witness statements to the prosecution. However, others counter that disclosure of unused prosecution evidence does not require defendants to generate new self-incriminating evidence or change trial strategy. The defense remains free to not disclose its case if it chooses.

A more compelling concern is whether expanded disclosure obligations undermine the requirement that the prosecution prove guilt. By obliging the prosecution to disclose even weak or speculative evidence, there is a risk the jury will give undue weight to such evidence or that the defense will be unable to effectively challenge it at trial. Several high-profile wrongful convictions have involved non-disclosure of speculative prosecution evidence that was later discredited.   

In conclusion, recent reforms have aimed to make the English criminal justice system fairer and more transparent but have raised legitimate concerns about the erosion of key adversarial principles. Greater disclosure risks compromising the privilege against self-incrimination and enabling undue reliance on weak prosecution evidence. However, others argue disclosure reforms remain compatible with a fair adversarial system if properly balanced with the continuing rights and obligations of the defense. Overall, there are good arguments on both sides, and reasonable people may disagree on where the right balance lies between disclosure and protecting adversarial principles.
