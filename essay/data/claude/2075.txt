To determine the total acidity of vinegar samples, an experiment was conducted involving the standardisation of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution and titration of the NaOH solution with several vinegar samples to determine their acidity levels. The standardisation of the NaOH was necessary to determine its exact concentration before using it as a titrant. This was done by titrating 10 millilitres of a potassium hydrogen phthalate solution of known concentration (0.1 moles per litre) with the NaOH solution. The volume of NaOH required to neutralise the known phthalate solution was 49.4 millilitres. Given the known concentration of the phthalate solution, it was calculated that the concentration of the NaOH solution was 0.1995 moles per litre. 

Three vinegar samples of white vinegar (5% acetic acid), malt vinegar (3.5% acetic acid), and balsamic vinegar (6% acetic acid) were then titrated with the standardised NaOH solution. 10 millilitres of each vinegar sample were titrated, and the volumes of NaOH required to neutralise the samples were recorded. The white vinegar sample took 34.9 millilitres of NaOH to neutralise, the malt vinegar took 28.8 millilitres, and the balsamic vinegar took 39.0 millilitres. Since the concentration of the NaOH was known, these volumes were used to calculate the concentration of acetic acid in each vinegar samples. The white vinegar was found to be 4.89% acetic acid, the malt vinegar was 3.35% acetic acid, and the balsamic vinegar was 5.88% acetic acid. 

The pH of each vinegar sample was also measured using a pH sensor. The white vinegar had a pH of 2.59, the malt vinegar had a pH of 2.82, and the balsamic vinegar had a pH of 3.22. The total acidity of the vinegars correlates with both the acetic acid concentration and the pH. The balsamic vinegar had the highest acidity with the highest acetic acid concentration and lowest pH. The malt vinegar had the lowest acidity with the lowest acetic acid and highest pH.

There are a few potential sources of error in this experiment. One is inaccurate measurement of volumes of solutions during titration, which could have led to errors in calculating acetic acid concentrations. The pH sensor may also have given slightly inaccurate pH readings. Another source of error is that the acetic acid concentration of the vinegar samples is assumed based on the titration, but the samples may have contained other acidic compounds that also contributed to the total acidity. Overall, however, this experiment demonstrated a useful method to determine and compare the total acidity and pH levels of various types of vinegar using standardisation and titration techniques.
