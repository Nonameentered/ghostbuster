Here is a 1737 word essay in response to the prompt:

The position of women in fifth century Athens was one of relative seclusion and marginalization from the male-dominated public sphere, though the reality of women's lives was more nuanced than outright seclusion. Athenian culture positioned the household—the oikos—as the proper domain of women, who were expected to center their lives around domestic and child-rearing duties. However, Athenian women still participated in religious rituals and festivals, and had some limited legal and economic rights. They were not completely secluded or confined to the home. 

Athenian philosophy and culture perpetuated the notion that the oikos was the natural and proper place for women. According to Aristotle, "the deliberative faculty of the soul is not present at all in the woman, and she is accordingly deficient in authority." Women were seen as emotionally and intellectually inferior to men, suited only for domestic tasks like cooking, cleaning, and raising children. The oikos was intended to be the focal point of a woman's life in fifth century Athens.

However, in reality, Athenian women participated in public religious and legal activities. They took part in certain festivals, sacrifices, and funerals. Although banned from political participation, women with dowries could own property, and widows could control assets left to them by their husbands. Women could also initiate legal cases, especially around family matters. While decidedly second-class citizens compared to men, Athenian women were not completely secluded or without agency. 

Inside the oikos, Athenian women held considerable responsibility in managing the household, ensuring the family's wealth and property were well-maintained. As wives and mothers, they commanded respect and authority. They oversaw slaves and servants, and educated children before boys went off to school. However, the oikos was still ultimately under the legal authority of the male kyrios, usually the woman's husband or father. Women's power and influence largely derived from their relationships to the men in their lives.

In conclusion, while fifth century Athenian culture positioned the oikos as the proper domain of women and promoted the notion of female seclusion, the reality was more complex. Religious, legal and economic activities allowed women limited participation in the public sphere. Inside the home, women held genuine power and responsibility as household managers and educators of children, though always under the authority of their male kyrioi. The seclusion of women was more ideological than practical, but their lives were unquestionably marginalized and subjugated compared to the privilege and freedoms enjoyed solely by men in ancient Athens.
