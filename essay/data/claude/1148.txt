Examine how Catullus emphasises the two-facedness of love relationship through the reflection of the gap between ideal and reality of marriage and friendship, with specific focus on Catullus' use of marriage in his poems. 

The Roman poet Catullus explores the dichotomy between the ideal and reality of relationships in his poems. Specifically, his poems depicting marriage and friendship highlight the two-faced nature of these relationships. On the one hand, there are socially accepted ideals of marriage as a sacred institution between loving partners and of friendship as a mutual bond. However, Catullus' poems reveal the gap between these ideals and the messy realities of relationships. Through his depiction of marriage, in particular, Catullus emphasises how it can be a source of both joy and sorrow, security and entrapment.

Catullus suggests marriage is ideally a joyous union of two loving individuals, as evoked in his epithalamia or wedding songs, such as Poem 61. The lavish imagery of a 'house filled with delight' and 'charming love' conveys the couple's happiness on their wedding day. The chanting chorus calls on the couple to 'be bound in eternal devotion' and 'cling in a chaste embrace', reflecting the notion that marriage is sacred and based on mutual love and faithfulness. 

However, other poems reveal the grimmer reality that marriage can descend into sorrow and resentment. In Poem 11, Catullus recounts attending a 'little dinner' at a friend's house, where the hostess is unhappily married to a 'middle-rank seducer'. The poem highlights her misery through the 'flood of tears' she cries in 'grief for her lost virginity'. The 'little dinner' thus becomes symbolic of her entrapment within an unhappy marriage. 

Poem 68 also exposes a darker side of marriage in the tragic tale of Laodamia and Protesilaus. While Laodamia idealises marriage and longs to be with her husband, her hopes turn into 'sorrow and disaster' when Protesilaus is killed shortly after their wedding. On his brief return from the dead, Protesilaus declares 'there's no delight in marriage or in love' due to its impermanence, presenting a bleak view of marriage that sharply contrasts with its usual depiction as a blissful union. 

Through these poems, Catullus reveals that marriage can be a source of both joy and grief, love and resentment, security and entrapment. The ideal of marriage as a sacred and eternal bond of delight is undermined by the harsher reality that it does not always lead to happiness. Catullus thus uses depictions of marriage in his poems to emphasise the Janus-faced nature of relationships.

In conclusion, Catullus' poems highlight the dichotomy between ideals and realities of relationships through his exploration of marriage and friendship. His poems depicting marriage, in particular, reveal that it cannot be simplified as either a blissful or sorrowful institution. Instead, Catullus suggests that marriage encompasses the potential for both joy and grief, love and resentment, as relationships are complex affairs that rarely match up to their idealised notions. Overall, Catullus uses the two-facedness of marriage in his poems as a microcosm through which to convey the Janus-faced nature of human relationships.
