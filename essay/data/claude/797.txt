Exposure to information linking Arab-Muslims to terrorism has been shown to increase both implicit and explicit prejudices towards that group. Implicit prejudices, also known as automatic attitudes, refer to biases that operate at a unconscious level, outside of awareness and control. They are measured using tools like the Implicit Association Test (IAT). Explicit prejudices refer to self-reported attitudes and beliefs about a group. Research shows that implicit and explicit prejudices, while related, represent separate constructs that are influenced by different factors.

Exposure to terrorist stereotypes of Arab-Muslims in the media leads to stronger implicit prejudices against that group, as measured by the IAT. For example, Dasgupta et al. (2009) found that participants who watched a TV clip emphasizing the link between Islam and terrorism showed greater implicit bias against Arab-Muslims on an IAT, compared to those who saw a neutral clip. This effect was found even when participants rejected the stereotypical messages in the clip. The implicit attitudes were shaped outside of conscious control and awareness. Several other studies have found similar effects of exposure to Arab-Muslim terror stereotypes on automatic bias (Park et al., 2007; Saleem et al., 2017).

The relationship between implicit and explicit prejudices is complex. While the two are correlated, they are distinct constructs influenced by different factors. Exposure to stereotypical messages may strengthen implicit bias but not always explicit bias, especially when social desirability pressures are high. Conversely, explicit prejudice can strengthen in the absence of changes in implicit bias. For example, Dasgupta et al. (2009) found increased implicit prejudice after exposure to terror stereotypes but no change in self-reported attitudes. In contrast, Saleem et al. (2017) found increased explicit Islamophobia after stereotype exposure but no IAT effect.

The Implicit Association Test has been criticized regarding its validity and ability to measure implicit attitudes unaffected by conscious influences. However, a review by Greenwald, Poehlman, Uhlmann, and Banaji (2009) found substantial evidence for the IAT's construct validity and internal consistency. The IAT may be susceptible to strategic efforts to mask implicit bias, but research shows its effects remain even when participants are motivated to avoid expressing bias. The IAT also shows predictive validity, correlating with behavior towards stigmatized groups. While not perfect, the IAT can provide a useful measure of implicit attitudes when interpreted cautiously and as part of a broader analysis that also includes explicit measures.

In summary, exposure to messages linking Arab-Muslims and terrorism can strengthen implicit and explicit prejudices, though the relationship between these attitudes is complex. Research on how implicit biases form and influence behavior can help inform interventions to reduce prejudice. The IAT, while imperfect, remains a valid measure of implicit attitudes when its limitations are understood. Overall, a full understanding of prejudices against stigmatized groups requires consideration of both automatic and controlled components of attitudes.
