The Association for the Advancement of Social Sciences (AASS) recommends placing four related propositions on the agenda for discussion at the next World Social Forum. These propositions aim to strengthen civil society activism and enable the adoption of an action platform to advance global justice in a more effective manner.  

The first proposition is that civil society organizations should seek to build strategic alliances and networks across sectors and areas of interest to tackle issues of global injustice in a coordinated fashion. At present, there are thousands of non-governmental organizations and civil society groups working to address social, economic and environmental challenges around the world. However, their efforts remain largely fragmented and isolated. Forming strategic partnerships and alliances across these groups would allow them to pool their resources, amplify each other’s voices, and advance shared goals in a more systematic way. Such coordinated action is crucial to counter the power and influence of governments and corporations seeking to maintain the status quo.

The second proposition is that civil society should develop a common platform of action based on a shared vision of global justice and human rights. At the moment, different organizations focus on specific issues in a somewhat ad hoc manner based on their particular areas of interest and expertise. Developing a common vision and set of principles on global justice and human rights would help align advocacy and activism around the world. A shared platform could highlight issues of shared concern, priorities for change, and recommended solutions and policy options. It could provide a rallying point for collaborative action across groups and communities. With a common vision and voice, civil society would be far better positioned to shape public opinion, influence policymakers, and drive real institutional changes.  

The third proposition is that civil society groups should invest in civic education and leadership development to strengthen communities and grassroots movements. Top-down activism and advocacy led by major NGOs need to be balanced with bottom-up pressures from empowered local communities and grassroots coalitions. Investment in civic education and leadership training is required to help communities understand issues of global justice, recognize and analyze problems affecting them, and organize themselves to take action. Stronger, more empowered grassroots movements would add momentum to the overall push for change and also put pressure on civil society organizations themselves to remain accountable to the communities they aim to serve.   

The fourth proposition is that civil society should make greater use of technology and digital tools to connect, communicate and coordinate activism on a global scale. New technologies like social media platforms, online collaboration tools and crowdfunding services provide civil society with opportunities to link up, share information and mobilize resources in ways not previously possible. However, many civil society organizations have been slow to adopt new technologies and utilize them to maximum effect. Investment in technology and skills training could help organizations modernize their approaches, amplify their messages, and coordinate activism on an unprecedented global scale.  

In summary, the four propositions recommended by AASS for discussion at the World Social Forum are: build strategic alliances, develop a shared platform of action, invest in civic education, and harness technology for activism. Implementing these propositions would significantly strengthen civil society’s ability to advance the cause of global justice by improving collaboration, focusing advocacy efforts, empowering communities, and facilitating action across borders. The World Social Forum provides an ideal opportunity for civil society organizations to explore these ideas, share lessons learned, build connections, and take the first steps toward a more coordinated approach to tackling injustice together. Overall, these four propositions suggest a promising path forward for civil society to gain more influence and drive greater progress on social, economic and environmental change around the world.
