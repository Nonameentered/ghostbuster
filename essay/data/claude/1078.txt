Here is a draft 1250 word essay in response to the prompt:

David Hume put forward two definitions of cause and effect in his philosophical writings, constant conjunction and necessary connection. These two perspectives differ in key ways and illustrate the dualist nature of Hume's understanding of causation.

Hume's first definition of causation is constant conjunction. This means that we observe two events, a cause and an effect, as constantly conjoined in our experience. For example, we have observed that the sun rises after the dawn so many times that we infer from this experience that the dawn causes the sun to rise. However, Hume argues that we cannot know for sure that A actually causes B simply because we have observed them occurring together repeatedly. Our mind has a habit of making such inferences, but there is no logical or deductive certainty that events we perceive as causally related will continue to be so in the future or that they are necessarily connected. All we have witnessed is that they have been constantly conjoined in the past.

Hume's second definition of cause and effect is necessary connection. This refers to an actual causal power that necessarily relates a cause and an effect. For Hume, we cannot observe such a necessary connection directly - we only see correlations and the constant conjunction of events. We interpret these correlations as reflecting an underlying causal power, but we have no evidence for such a power. We cannot logically prove that there are powers in objects that necessarily produce certain effects. Necessary connection is something we infer or project onto the world, not something we can observe. In summary, constant conjunction refers to observed patterns in our experience, while necessary connection refers to the causal power we infer or assume underlies those patterns.

Hume's view on miracles is a direct result of his strict empiricism and his two definitions of causation. For Hume, we cannot reasonably believe in miracles because they violate our normal experiences of cause and effect relationships. The evidence for miracles is typically in the testimony of fallible people, but we have much more consistent experience of causation in accordance with the laws of nature. It is always more likely that such testimony is faulty in some way rather than that the laws of nature have been violated. Belief in miracles relies on assuming a kind of necessary connection that Hume argues we have no evidence for.

In terms of whether causation has a physical element for Hume, the answer is complicated. On the one hand, Hume is a staunch empiricist and believes that all ideas are derived from experience, and experiences are ultimately caused by sensations of physical objects or events. In this sense, causation as we understand it does relate back to the physical world. However, Hume also argues that we have no impression of necessary connection and that this idea arises from within the mind. We project or infer necessary connections to physical events, but we have no sensory evidence that such powers genuinely exist in the objects themselves. So Hume has a kind of dualist perspective on causation that incorporates both the physical sensations that give rise to our ideas and the mental inferences we make about causal powers not grounded in any impression.

In conclusion, Hume proposed two radically different definitions of causation: constant conjunction and necessary connection. The former refers to observed patterns in experience, while the latter refers to the causal power we infer or project to explain those patterns. Hume's view on miracles follows directly from his strict empiricism and denial that we have evidence of casual powers beyond constant conjunction. And while Hume's theory of causation is rooted in his empiricism about sensory experience of the physical world, his conclusion that necessary connection is a mental projection also reflects a kind of dualism in his view of causation.
