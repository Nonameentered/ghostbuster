Here is a 1250 word essay in response to the prompt: 

Greenhouse gases are gases in the atmosphere that absorb and emit radiation within the thermal infrared range, causing the greenhouse effect. The major greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Their increasing concentration in the atmosphere due to human activities like burning of fossil fuels and deforestation is causing significant changes to the Earth's climate and global warming.

The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface and makes it habitable for life as we know it. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the lower atmosphere, called the troposphere, causing surface temperatures to be warmer by about 33Â°C than they would otherwise be. However, human activities like burning coal, oil and gas have caused the levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to increase significantly in the atmosphere since the industrial revolution. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by more than 45% since the Industrial Revolution, from about 280 parts per million in the 18th century to over 415 parts per million today. The concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide have also increased substantially.

As the concentrations of greenhouse gases rise, they enhance the natural greenhouse effect, causing an increase in the Earth's surface temperature and contributing to global warming. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global temperatures have already increased about 1 degree Celsius since pre-industrial levels due to human-caused increases in greenhouse gases, and are projected to rise at least 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels by 2100 if drastic action is not taken. The consequences of increasing global temperatures are devastating and far-reaching, including rising sea levels, stronger storms, more extreme weather events, worsening wildfires, and disruptions to agriculture.

In order to mitigate these consequences, we must take immediate actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to renewable energy and sustainable practices. By working together as a global community, we can curb climate change and secure a sustainable future for our planet. However, time is running out, so global cooperation and a rapid transition to greener technologies and economies is critical. Reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere is one of the greatest challenges of our time, but also one of humanity's most pressing priorities. Urgent action must be taken to address this issue and find solutions so we can create a habitable world for future generations.
