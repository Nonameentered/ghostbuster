Here is a draft 1750-word essay in response to the prompt:

The Enlightenment was a central intellectual movement of the 18th century that profoundly influenced the French Revolution. Enlightenment thinkers emphasized reason, science, individualism, and challenged traditional institutions and beliefs. These ideas helped shape the perspectives of French revolutionaries and contributed to growing dissatisfaction with the French monarchy. However, the Enlightenment was not solely responsible for the Revolution. There were also significant social, economic, and political problems in late 18th-century France that fueled revolutionary fervor.

The Enlightenment ideals of reason, progress, and natural rights inspired calls for political reform and challenges to absolute monarchy in France. Key Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu criticized the arbitrary rule of despotic kings and argued for more representative forms of government that protected individual liberty. These Enlightenment critiques resonated with many educated members of the French middle class, or bourgeoisie. They increasingly saw the lavish lifestyle of King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette as emblematic of the oppressive and irrational nature of the monarchy.

The economic crisis that France faced in the late 1780s also contributed to revolutionary unrest. A series of poor harvests and droughts caused food shortages and famines across France, which disproportionately affected the peasantry. At the same time, the French government's costly involvement in the American Revolution exacerbated the fiscal crisis and forced the king to raise taxes on the people. The taxation burdens fell most heavily on the peasantry and middle classes, heightening their resentment of the lavish royal court. Economic troubles and misery fueled popular anger against the monarchy.

There were also long-term social and political problems that set the stage for revolution. French society was divided into estates, with the nobility and Catholic clergy enjoying special privileges. The Third Estate, representing the peasantry, bourgeoisie, and urban workers, resented the special status of the nobility. They paid most of the country's taxes but had little political representation under the absolute monarchy. Calls for political reform and an end to the privileges of the nobility grew louder in the 1780s. The stubborn resistance to reform by Louis XVI further weakened the legitimacy of the monarchy in the eyes of the people.

In conclusion, while the Enlightenment ideals of liberty and political reform inspired the French Revolution, the monumental event was the result of a combination of factors. Severe economic troubles, social inequality, lack of political representation, and the perceived tyranny of King Louis XVI all contributed to the revolutionary fervor that gripped France in 1789 and culminated in the overthrow of the monarchy. The Enlightenment may have shaped the aspirations of revolutionary leaders, but the root causes of the Revolution ran much deeper in French society and politics. Overall, the major role played by the Enlightenment in the French Revolution cannot be separated from the broader social, economic and political context of 18th-century France.
