There are several key risk factors that increase an individual's likelihood of developing colorectal cancer. Age is one of the most significant risks, with majority of colorectal cancers occurring in people aged 65 years and older. This is because the disease often develops over a long period of time, so  the older a person gets, the higher the chance of colon cancer cells accumulating in the large intestine. Family history also plays a role, especially if a first-degree relative has had colorectal cancer before. 

Other risks include inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, obesity or being overweight, physical inactivity, a diet high in red meat and processed meats, heavy alcohol use, and long-term smoking. Given these risk factors, early detection of colorectal cancer through regular screening is critical to improving survival rates. The most common screening tests are stool tests to check for blood or DNA markers, colonoscopy, CT colonography or "virtual colonoscopy", and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Colonoscopy is considered the "gold standard" and allows for the removal of precancerous polyps during the procedure.

If colorectal cancer is detected, treatment options depend on the stage of the cancer. For early stage cancers, surgery to remove the tumor and surrounding colon tissue, followed by possible chemotherapy to reduce recurrence risk, is usually recommended. Later stage cancers typically require more aggressive treatments like radiation therapy in addition to chemotherapy and surgery. Some factors that guide treatment decisions include the location, stage and grade of the tumor, genomic features of the cancer, patient's age and overall health, potential side effects of treatment, and patient preferences.

Lastly, increasing participation in colorectal cancer screening programs remains an ongoing challenge, mainly due to the perceived stigma around stoma bags and embarrassment related to bowel preparation. Public education campaigns focused on raising awareness of the importance of screening can help reduce stigma over time. Healthcare providers should also address patients' concerns about potential side effects and discomfort from screening procedures. For those who require ostomy bags following surgery, seeking counselling or joining support groups may help with adjustment and improve quality of life. Overall, a multifaceted approach is needed to maximize colorectal cancer screening rates and decrease negative attitudes associated with this disease.
