Parity conditions refer to theoretical exchange rate relationships that assume goods and services should trade at the same price across countries when measured in a common currency. The key parity condition is purchasing power parity (PPP), which states that the ratio of exchange rates between two countries should equal the ratio of prices for a basket of goods and services in those countries. In other words, PPP suggests that exchange rates should adjust to offset price level differences between countries. 

The theory of PPP is based on the Law of One Price (LOP), which states that identical goods should sell for the same price in different markets when measured in the same currency. PPP extends this concept to a basket of goods and suggests that price level differences between countries, measured in a common currency, should be reflected in exchange rate differences. If PPP holds, it suggests that exchange rates will adjust to account for inflation differentials between countries in order to keep the costs of goods and services aligned.

However, there is mixed empirical evidence regarding the validity of PPP as a guide for exchange rate behavior. In the short run, exchange rates are very volatile and often deviate from PPP. Over longer periods of several years or decades, some research does suggest that PPP tends to hold as price levels and exchange rates converge. But PPP does not always provide an accurate prediction of actual exchange rate movements. Some reasons for the deviations from PPP include transportation costs, trade barriers, non-tradable goods, and speculative forces in the foreign exchange market.

For PPP to be a useful theory of exchange rate determination, exchange rates and price levels must be stationary over the long run. Stationarity means that these economic variables have constant means, variances, and covariances over time. If exchange rates and price levels are nonstationary, then deviations from PPP may persist and PPP will not hold even in the long run. Two common methods for testing stationarity and PPP are the augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and cointegration analysis.

The ADF test examines whether a variable, such as an exchange rate, has a unit root. The presence of a unit root means the variable is nonstationary. If the ADF test shows exchange rates are nonstationary, that implies PPP does not hold. Alternatively, if exchange rates are found to be stationary, that supports PPP in the long run. Cointegration analysis tests whether a linear combination of two nonstationary variables, such as an exchange rate and a price level index, is stationary. If cointegrated, the variables share a long-run equilibrium which is consistent with PPP theory.

In summary, parity conditions like PPP provide a theoretical framework for how exchange rates should behave to equalize the costs of goods and services across countries. However, in reality deviations from PPP are common due to various market imperfections and forces. Empirical evidence on the validity of PPP is mixed, though some studies do find support for PPP in the long run as shown through stationarity and cointegration tests. PPP continues to be a active area of research in international finance.
