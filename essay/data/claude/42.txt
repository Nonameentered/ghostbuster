Jürgen Habermas's work relates to Marxist theory in complex and nuanced ways. There are some notable similarities between Habermas's ideas and those of Karl Marx, including a critique of capitalism and ideology, a belief in class conflict, and a call for radical societal change. However, Habermas also departs from Marxism in important respects. Overall, Habermas offers a positive revision and critique of Marxist thought by updating Marxism for modern capitalist societies and deepening its theoretical underpinnings.

Like Marx, Habermas is highly critical of capitalism and believes it creates inherent contradictions and crises. However, while Marx focused on the tensions between the capitalist and proletarian classes under industrial capitalism, Habermas is more concerned with the rationality crisis within advanced capitalist societies in the post-World War II era. For Habermas, capitalism's relentless expansion of productivity and growth begins to undermine the social and cultural structures that it relies on, creating legitimation crises. So Habermas shares Marx's spirit of critique but applies it to contemporary contexts.

Habermas also maintains Marx's theory of class conflict, but again recasts it in modern terms. For Marx, the central class conflict was between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat. For Habermas, the key conflict is between the economic or "system" domain of society and the social or "lifeworld" domain. The capitalist economy colonizes the lifeworld, instrumentalizing the cultural structures and communication channels that govern everyday social life. This conflict leads to a "motivation crisis" where social actors become disenchanted with the process of capitalist rationalization. So Habermas retains the idea of class struggle but broadens and abstracts it.  

Both Marx and Habermas are also sharply critical of dominant ideologies that legitimate capitalism and see ideology critique as central to radical social change. However, Habermas again builds on and amends Marx's theory. For Marx, the ruling class shapes ideology to justify its domination, and ideology is a kind of false consciousness that obscures real social relations. For Habermas, ideologies are rooted in the communicative processes of the lifeworld. They only become problematic when the economic system begins to distort them to rationalize itself. Habermas also sees ideology critique as aimed at redeeming the emancipatory potential that is inherent—if suppressed—in everyday communication. So ideology functions differently in Habermas's theoretical framework compared to Marx's.
