The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) is a global partnership that unites international organizations engaged in research for a food secure future. Established in 1971, CGIAR aims to advance agricultural science and innovation to promote food security, improve human nutrition and health, and foster equitable and sustainable agricultural development. 

Initially, CGIAR focused on increasing agricultural productivity through crop breeding and improving farming techniques. Early research targeted increased yields of staple crops such as rice, wheat, and maize. Over time, CGIAR's mission has expanded to include natural resource management, policy research, nutrition, and other areas that affect livelihoods in developing countries. Current research priorities include breeding crops for heat and drought tolerance, developing systems to minimize agriculture's environmental footprint, improving nutrition, and policy research to support agricultural development.

CGIAR's research is carried out by 15 Research Centers based around the world. CGIAR's governance includes donors, developing and developed countries, foundations, regional and international organizations, and research institutions. Decisions about research projects and allocation of resources are made based on strategic reviews of global challenges and consultations with stakeholders. The CGIAR System Organization coordinates the overall network and a CGIAR System Council provides guidance on research priorities and sets policies.

Some examples of CGIAR's work include the development of over 3,000 improved crop varieties that are grown on over 200 million hectares worldwide. Improved varieties have helped some developing countries become self-sufficient in staple crops.  CGIAR's research on integrated pest management has reduced pesticide use while maintaining crop yields. Work on natural resource management has led to improvements in water usage, soil fertility, and biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes. Research on farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa has helped over 2 million farm households increase crop yields.

CGIAR's programs have had significant impact, yet rural poverty remains widespread. CGIAR aims to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers who make up a large portion of the world's poor. However, there are many challenges. Reaching marginalized groups with limited resources remains difficult. The effects of climate change threaten agricultural production and the natural environment. Lack of policy support in some countries limits the impact of new technologies and management practices. Rapid population growth strains agricultural systems and natural resources. 

In summary, CGIAR is a long-standing partnership that has advanced agricultural research and technologies to combat poverty, hunger, and malnutrition in developing countries. CGIAR has had many achievements that have improved livelihoods, but the challenges of poverty, climate change, population growth, and policy limitations persist. Overall, CGIAR's programs have led to progress, but continued innovation and adaptation will be needed to achieve a sustainable food system that benefits smallholder farmers and the planet.
