Here is a 1250 word essay in response to the prompt:

Applied linguistics involves studying language in real world contexts and using analytical techniques to gain insights into how language works and is used in society. Two important tools used by applied linguists are concordance lines and critical discourse analysis. 

A concordance is a list of occurrences of a word or phrase in a text along with the surrounding context for each occurrence. Concordance lines are the lines in a concordance that show a word or phrase in context. By examining many concordance lines for a word or phrase, patterns can emerge regarding how it is used. For example, a study of the concordance lines for the word “woman” in a large collection of text may show that it collocates frequently with words like “emotional,” “irrational,” or “nagging.” This could reveal subtle biases or stereotypes in how women are portrayed in that discourse community. Concordance lines are a data-driven way to study language in an authentic, unelicited manner.

Critical discourse analysis aims to uncover hidden or obscured meanings and power dynamics within texts. Discourse refers to language in use, and critical discourse analysis examines how discourse influences society and politics. It asks questions about how language is used to construct knowledge and exercise power over groups of people. For example, a critical analysis of political speeches may show how rhetoric is used to portray certain groups as “others” who threaten traditional values. Or an analysis of media coverage could uncover how subtle linguistic choices serve to blame or exonerate people in a biased way.

By using these tools together, applied linguists have found many interesting insights. For example, one study analyzed concordance lines for words related to environmental protection in political speeches over several decades. It found that politicians increasingly used terms like “climate change” but used them in a vague manner without committing to concrete actions—a sign of “greenwashing” to appeal to environmentalist voters. Another study used critical discourse analysis to compare how British newspapers represented two serious crimes, finding that an attack by Muslim extremists received far more sensationalized coverage than an attack by a non-Muslim. 

In conclusion, concordance lines and critical discourse analysis allow applied linguists to study language not in contrived settings but as it is used in meaningful social contexts. By taking a data-driven and theory-informed approach, these tools can reveal significant insights into biases, power dynamics, and other issues in how language shapes or is shaped by the world we live in. Applied linguistics aims to conduct rigorous and ethical studies that can contribute to important debates and push for positive change on both local and global scales.
