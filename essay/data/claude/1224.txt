Sheepdrove Organic Farm is a certified organic farm in Berkshire, England that produces and sells lamb and mutton as a year-round product. They are able to provide a consistent supply of sheep meat throughout the year through the use of carefully managed production systems and breeding methods that prioritize the health and sustainability of their sheep flock.

Sheepdrove Organic Farm raises a mixed flock of over 1000 breeding ewes composed of several hardy breeds, including Clun Forest, Hampshire Down, and Southdown breeds. By selecting breeds that are well-suited to organic farming and the local climate, the farm is able to maintain a healthy and productive flock. The breeding and lambing seasons are planned to ensure a steady supply of lambs that can be raised and sold as meat throughout the year. Most lambing happens in the spring, but a smaller number of ewes also lamb in the autumn to provide meat for the winter months.

The farm provides high-quality organic feed, mineral supplements, and pasture to support the nutritional needs of the flock during all seasons. The sheep primarily graze on a mixture of grass and legume pastures, with supplemental feed provided during winter and when pasture growth is limited. The flock is frequently rotated between pastures to prevent overgrazing and allow pastures to rest and regenerate. This rotational grazing system helps to maintain the health of the soil and grasslands, which in turn keeps the sheep flock well fed and able to reproduce regularly.

Animal health and welfare are also prioritized through high standards of care, hygiene, and breeding. The farm has a rigorous culling program to remove any ill or non-productive sheep, and maintains a closed flock to prevent disease introduction from outside. Breeding is carefully planned to avoid inbreeding and produce healthy lambs. The farm also has their own organic certifying organization that performs annual inspections to ensure high standards of animal welfare and organic integrity. 

Through the use of suitable hardy breeds, a planned breeding schedule, high-quality organic feed, rotational grazing, and exceptional animal care standards, Sheepdrove Organic Farm is able to raise a sustainable and productive sheep flock. They are thus able to produce and sell high-quality organic lamb and mutton consistently year-round to meet the demands of consumers. The farm serves as an excellent model for environmentally friendly and humane sheep farming.
