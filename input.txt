After reviewing my answer and considering the circumstances, I believe I deserve partial credit for this question.
Upon reflection, I acknowledge that I made an error in not recognizing that "enigma" was composed of two functions. Due to the time crunch during the exam, I unintentionally overlooked this crucial detail, resulting in an incorrect answer. However, I would like to bring to your attention that my intended answer was N^N, as X is equivalent to N in the helper method.
Considering that X = N, the partial credit solution in question 4.4 is N^N. Although my response indicated N^X instead of N^N, it is evident that my original intention aligned with the partial credit solution. Therefore, I believe it is reasonable to request that some points be reinstated for this question.
I understand that it is important to adhere to the guidelines and grading rubric. However, given the extenuating circumstances surrounding the time pressure during the exam, I kindly request your consideration in revisiting my answer. By awarding partial credit, it would acknowledge my comprehension of the underlying concept and ensure a fair evaluation of my performance.
